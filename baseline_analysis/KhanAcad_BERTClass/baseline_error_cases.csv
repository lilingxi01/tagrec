" In the last video we were able to set up this definite integral using the shell or the hollow cylinder method in order to figure out the volume of this solid of revolution. And so now let's just evaluate this thing. And really the main thing we have to do here is just to multiply what we have here out. So multiply this expression out. So this is going to be equal to-- I'll take the 2 pi out of the integral. 2 pi times the integral from 0 to 1. Let's see, 2 times the square root of x is 2-- I'll write it as 2 square roots of x. But I'll write it as 2x to the 1/2. It'll make it a little bit easier to take the antiderivative conceptually, or at least in our brain. So two times the square root of x is 2x to the 1/2. 2 times negative x squared is negative 2 x squared. And then we have negative x times the square root of x. Well, that's x to the first times x to the 1/2. That's going to be negative x to the 3/2 power. And then we have negative x times negative x squared that's going to be positive x to the third power. And all of that dx. And so now we're ready to take the antiderivative. So this is going to be equal to 2 pi times the antiderivative of all of this business evaluated at 1 and at 0. So the antiderivative of 2 times x to the 1/2 is going to be 2-- it's going to be-- let's see. We're going to take x to the 3/2 times 2/3. So it's going to be 4/3 x to the 3/2. And then for this term right over here it's going to be negative 2/3 x to the third. And you could take the derivative here to verify that you actually do get this. And then right over here, let's see, if we incremented this, you get x to the 5/2. And so we're going to want to multiply by 2/5. So minus-- let me do this in another color. Let's see, so this one right over here, it's going to be minus 2/5 x to the 5/2 power. Yep, that works out. And then finally you're going to have x to the fourth over 4 plus-- let me do that in a different color-- plus x to the fourth over 4. That's this term right over here. And now we just have to evaluate at 1 and 0. And 0, luckily, all of these terms end up being a 0. So that's nice and cancels out. And so we are just left with-- we're just-- [INAUDIBLE] cancel out. It just evaluates to 0. So this is just 2 pi times when you evaluate all this business at 1. So that's going to be 4/3 minus 2/3 minus 2/5 plus 1/4. And the least common multiple right over here looks like 60, so we're going to want to put all this over a denominator of 60. So it's going to be 2 pi times all of this business over a denominator of 60. And 4/3 is same thing as 80/60. Negative 2/3 is the same thing as negative 40/60. Negative 2/5 is the same thing as negative 24/60. And then 1/4 is the same thing as 15/60. So this is equal to-- and actually this will cancel over here, and you'll just get a 30 in your denominator. So in your denominator, you get a 30. And up here 80 minus 40 is 40. 40 minus 24 gets us to 16. 16 plus 15 is 31. So we get 31 times pi over 30 for the volume of the figure right over there.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-applications-definite-integrals
" -  So what we're gonna do in this video is several examples where we evaluate expressions with definite integrals and so right over here we have the definite integral from negative two to three of 2 f(x)dx plus the definite integral from 3 to seven of 3 f(x)dx and all we know about f(x) is the graph of y=f(x) from negative, from x equals negative six to x equals seven. They also give us the areas between f(x), y equals f(x) and the x axis. The negative areas show that our function is below the x axis and so given that, can we evaluate that and like always, pause the video and see if you can do it on your own. Well the first thing that my brain wants to do is I want to, I want to take these constants out of the integral because then once they're out and I'm just taking the straight up definite integrals of f(x), I can relate that to the areas over here and I know I can do that and this is a very common integration property and applies to definite and indefinite integrals but if I'm taking the integral of k f(x)dx, this is the same thing as k times the integral of f(x)dx. So let's just apply that property there which is really you're taking the scaler outside of the integral. To say this is going to be the same thing as two times the definite integral from negative two to three of f(x)dx plus three times the integral from three to seven of f(x)dx. All right. Now can we evaluate these things? So what is this going to be? The definite integral from negative two to three of f(x)dx. Well we can view that as the area between the curves y equals f(x) and the x axis, between x equals negative two and x equals three. So between x equals two and x equals three, they give us the area between y equals f(x) and the x axis. It is seven. So this thing over here is seven and then we have the integral from three to seven of f(x) so we're gonna go from three to seven and once again, well this is going to evaluate to a negative value because f(x) is below the x axis there and it's going to evaluate to negative three. So this is all going to be this is going to be two times seven so 14 plus, 14 plus three times negative three so plus negative nine and so 14 minus nine is equal to five. This is fun. Let's do more of these. All right. Okay, so here this first integral the integral from zero to five of f(x)dx, so this is pretty straightforward. This right over here, we're gonna go from zero to five. Zero to five and of f(x)dx, so we're talking about this area there which they tell us is four so that was pretty easy to evaluate and now we're gonna subtract, we're gonna subtract going from negative eight to negative four times 2f(x), well let's just take this two outside. So if we just take this two outside, then this just becomes the integral from negative eight to negative four of f(x) and so this thing, this thing right over here evaluates to five. It's this area they're talking about. So this is all going to simplify to four minus that two that we brought out, minus two times five. Times five, which is equal to let's see four minus 10 which is equal to negative six. All right. Let's do another one of these. So here I have the integral from negative seven to negative five so I'm going from negative seven to negative five which is, it's gonna be right around there so I want to find, I want to find this area right over here. So I want to find that area. That's that and then I'm gonna go from negative five to zero. So then this is going to be going from negative five to zero so it's gonna be all of that. Now there's a couple of ways you can think about doing it. You can assume I have some symmetry here and they don't tell it for sure but it looks very symmetric around x equals negative five so you could assume that this eight is split between these two regions but an easier way to do it is just to realize look, I went from negative seven to negative five and then from negative five to zero and I'm integrating the same thing. F(x)dx so this integral I can rewrite as the integral from negative seven so negative seven all the way to zero of f(x), f(x)dx and so really that's just going to be the net area between negative seven and zero and so we have the positive eight there so this is going to be equal to the positive eight and then we have the negative one there so minus one which is equal to seven.",math_old-integral-calculus_definite-integrals-intro-ic
" What we're going to do in this video is review the product rule that you probably learned a while ago. And from that, we're going to derive the formula for integration by parts, which could really be viewed as the inverse product rule, integration by parts. So let's say that I start with some function that can be expressed as the product f of x, can be expressed as a product of two other functions, f of x times g of x. Now let's take the derivative of this function, let's apply the derivative operator right over here. And this, once again, just a review of the product rule. It's going to be the derivative of the first function times the second function. So it's going to be f-- no, I'm going to do that blue color-- it's going to be f-- that's not blue-- it's going to be f prime of x times g of x times-- that's not the same color-- times g of x plus the first function times the derivative of the second, plus the first function, f of x, times the derivative of the second. This is all a review right over here. The derivative of the first times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. Now, let's take the antiderivative of both sides of this equation. Well if I take the antiderivative of what I have here on the left, I get f of x times g of x. We won't think about the constant for now. We can ignore that for now. And that's going to be equal to-- well what's the antiderivative of this? This is going to be the antiderivative of f prime of x times g of x dx plus the antiderivative of f of x g prime of x dx. Now, what I want to do is I'm going to solve for this part right over here. And to solve for that, I just have to subtract this business. I just have to subtract this business from both sides. And then if I subtract that from both sides, I'm left with f of x times g of x minus this, minus the antiderivative of f prime of x g of x-- let me do that in a pink color-- g of x dx is equal to what I wanted to solve for, is equal to the antiderivative of f of x g prime of x dx. And to make it a little bit clearer, let me swap sides here. So let me copy and paste this. So let me copy and then paste it. There you go. And then let me copy and paste the other side. So let me copy and paste it. So I'm just switching the sides, just to give it in a form that you might be more used to seeing in a calculus book. So this is essentially the formula for integration by parts. I will square it off. You'll often see it squared off in a traditional textbook. So I will do the same. So this right over here tells us that if we have an integral or an antiderivative of the form f of x times the derivative of some other function, we can apply this right over here. And you might say, well this doesn't seem that useful. First I have to identify a function that's like this. And then still I have an integral in it. But what we'll see in the next video is that this can actually simplify a whole bunch of things that you're trying to take the antiderivative of.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-integration-new
" - Line segments IN, this is segment IN over here, and TO, this is TO here, are reflected over the line Y is equal to negative X minus two. So this is the line that they're reflected about this dashed, purple line. And it is indeed Y equals negative X minus two. This right over here is in slope intercept form. The slope should be negative one, and we see that the slope of this purple line is indeed negative one. If X changes by a certain amount, Y changes by the negative of that. If X changes by one, Y changes by negative one to get back to that line. If X changes by positive two, Y changes by negative two to get back to another point on that line. And the Y intercept? We see when X is equal to zero, Y should be negative two. When X is equal to zero, Y is indeed negative two. So we've validated that. Then they say, ""Draw the image of this reflection, using the interactive graph."" Alright, so we can move these lines around, and we want to reflect these. And I could try to eyeball it, you know, maybe it's something like this. I don't know, it doesn't exactly right. That looks close to the reflection of IN, and for TO I'd want to move this down here. TO looks like it would be, I don't know, I'm eyeballing it. This is close, but it can't be close. I want to get exact. So let's, I've copied and pasted the original problem on my scratch pad so we can find the exact points and so I don't just have to estimate this. So let's go to the scratch pad. So exactly what we just saw. And the main realization is, is that if we want to reflect a given point, if we want to reflect a given point, say point I right over here, what we want to do is we want to drop a perpendicular. We want to find a line that's perpendicular, or a line that has the point I on it, and it's perpendicular to this line right over here. Remember this is the line, let me do this is that purple color. This is the line, Y is equal to negative X minus two. Its slope is equal to negative one. So I want a line that goes through I, point I, that is perpendicular to this line, and I want to drop it, I want to drop it to, I want to drop it to the line that I'm going to reflect on, and then I'm going to go the same distance onto the other side to find to find the corresponding point in the image. So how do I do that? Well if this line, if this purple line has a slope of negative one, a line that is perpendicular to it a line that is perpendicular to it so this thing that I'm drawing in purple right over here, its slope is going to be the negative reciprocal of this. So the reciprocal of negative one is still just negative one. One over negative one is still negative one. But we want the negative of that. So the slope here needs to be one. And luckily, that's how I drew it. The slope here needs to be equal to one which is however much I change in the X direction I change in the Y direction. We see that. To go from this point to this point right over here, we decrease Y by four and we decrease X by four. Now, if we want to stay on this line to find the reflection, we just do the same thing. We could decrease X by four, so we'll go from negative two to negative six, and decrease Y by four, and we end up at this point right over here. So we end up at the point, this is X equals negative six, Y is equal to negative four. So this is, this point corresponds to this point right over there. Now, let's do the same thing. Let's do the same thing for point N. For point N, we already know, if we drop a perpendicular, and this is perpendicular, it's going to have a slope of one because this purple line has a slope of negative one. The negative reciprocal of negative one is positive one. And let's see, to go from this point to this point of intersection, we have to go down one and a half. We're going down one and a half, and we're going to the left one and a half. So we want to do that on the other side. We want to stay on this perpendicular line. So we want to go left one and a half, and down one and a half. And we get to this point right over here, which is the point X equals three, Y is equal to negative eight. So we are now equidistant. We're on this perpendicular line, still, but we're equidistant on the other side. So the image of IN is going to go through negative six, negative four, and three, negative eight. So let me draw that. Let me see if I can remember, negative six, negative four, and three, negative eight. So I have a bad memory. So negative six, negative four, and three, negative eight. And I was close when I estimated, but I wasn't exactly right. So that's looking pretty good. And actually, we can do the exact same thing with points T and point O. Let me do that. So point T, to point T, To get from point T to the line in the shortest distance, once again, we drop a perpendicular. This line is going to have a slope of one, because it's perpendicular to the line that has a slope of negative one. And so to get there, we have to decrease our X by we have to decrease our X. We're going from X equals five to X equals, it looks like, half. So X went down by four and a half in the X direction and Y also needs to go down by four and a half. So if we want to stay on that line, let's decrease our X by four and a half. So that's half, one, two, three, four. And Y needs to go down by four and a half. So that's half, one, two, three, four, and we get to this point right over here, which is the point X equals negative four, Y is equal to negative seven. And it's negative four, negative seven. Let me, so this should be at, X equals negative four, Y equals negative seven. And there's a couple of things you could do here. You could just say, hey, this is two long, or two units long, not like, too long in length, somehow. This is two units long, so maybe this is two units long. So this is feeling pretty good. But let's just go through the exercise for point O as well. So point O, once again, this is going to have, if we drop a perpendicular, it's going to have a slope of one. So whatever our change in X between this point and this point, we're going to have the same change in Y. And our change in X, to go from seven to... Seven to one and a half, our change in X is five and a half. So then we do it this way. So the change in X here, so the change in X is equal to negative five and a half, five point five. If you subtract five point five from seven, you get to one point five. And our change in Y. Our change in Y is also negative five point five. Change is Y is negative, you're not going to see that so I'm going to do it differently, negative five point five. And so we need to stay on this line. So we need to change by those same amounts onto the other side of that line. So if we decrease our X by five and a half. So half, one, two, three, four, five, we get there, and Y by five and a half, half, one, two, three, four, five. We get to the point, X equals negative four, Y is equal to negative nine. So we get to the point X equals negative four, Y is equal to negative nine, and we're done! We have figured out the reflection of these two segments.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-symmetry-icse
" -  A secant line intersects the curve y = 2x squared + 1 at two points with x-coordinates 4 and 4 + h, where h does not equal 0. What is the slope of the secant line in terms of h? Your answer must be fully expanded and simplified. We know the two points that are on the secant line. It might not be obvious from how they wrote it but let's make a little table here to make that a little bit clearer. We have x and then we have y = 2x squared + 1. So we know that when x = 4, what is y going to be equal to? It's gonna be 2(4 squared) + 1 which is the same thing as 2(16) +1 which is the same thing as 32 + 1 so it is going to be 33. What about when x = 4 + h? Well it's going to be 2(4 +h)squared + 1. That's going to be 2 times, let's see, (4 + h)squared is going to be 16 + 8h + h squared and then we have our + 1 still and if we distribute the 2 that's going to get us to 32 + 16h + 2h squared + 1 and then we add the 32 to the 1 and actually I'm gonna switch the order a little bit so I have the highest degree term first so it's going to be 2h squared + 16h and then + 32 + 1 is 33. We have these two points. We have one point (4, 33) and we have the other point (4+h, 2h squared + 16h + 33) and we just have to find the slope between these two points because the secant line contains both of these points. How do we find the slope of a line? We do change in y / change in x. What's our change in y? If we view this as the end point and this as the starting point, our change in y is going to be this minus that. It's going to be 2h squared + 16h + 33 - 33, those two are going to cancel each other out, and then over, what's our change in x? If we ended at 4 + h but then we started at 4 so it's gonna be 4 + h - 4. These two cancel each with each other and we are left with 2h squared + 16h / h. We can divide everything in the numerator and denominator by h and what are we going to get? This is going to be 1. That's just a 1. This is just an h. We have 2h + 16 / 1. Or just 2h + 16. And we're done. This is the slope of the secant line in terms of h. Once again we just have to think about well the secant line contains the point (4,f(4)) or 2 times 4 squared + 1 right over here and, well I didn't call this f(x) but I think you get the idea, and then when x is 4 + h this is going to be y and we just found the slope between these two points.",math_differential-calculus_dc-diff-intro
" In this video, I want to talk about what is easily one of the most fundamental and profound concepts in statistics and maybe in all of mathematics. And that's the central limit theorem. And what it tells us is we can start off with any distribution that has a well-defined mean and variance-- and if it has a well-defined variance, it has a well-defined standard deviation. And it could be a continuous distribution or a discrete one. I'll draw a discrete one, just because it's easier to imagine, at least for the purposes of this video. So let's say I have a discrete probability distribution function. And I want to be very careful not to make it look anything close to a normal distribution. Because I want to show you the power of the central limit theorem. So let's say I have a distribution. Let's say it could take on values 1 through 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. It's some kind of crazy dice. It's very likely to get a one. Let's say it's impossible-- well, let me make that a straight line. You have a very high likelihood of getting a 1. Let's say it's impossible to get a 2. Let's say it's an OK likelihood of getting a 3 or a 4. Let's say it's impossible to get a 5. And let's say it's very likely to get a 6 like that. So that's my probability distribution function. If I were to draw a mean-- this the symmetric, so maybe the mean would be something like that. The mean would be halfway. So that would be my mean right there. The standard deviation maybe would look-- it would be that far and that far above and below the mean. But that's my discrete probability distribution function. Now what I'm going to do here, instead of just taking samples of this random variable that's described by this probability distribution function, I'm going to take samples of it. But I'm going to average the samples and then look at those samples and see the frequency of the averages that I get. And when I say average, I mean the mean. Let me define something. Let's say my sample size-- and I could put any number here. But let's say first off we try a sample size of n is equal to 4. And what that means is I'm going to take four samples from this. So let's say the first time I take four samples-- so my sample sizes is four-- let's say I get a 1. Let's say I get another 1. And let's say I get a 3. And I get a 6. So that right there is my first sample of sample size 4. I know the terminology can get confusing. Because this is the sample that's made up of four samples. But then when we talk about the sample mean and the sampling distribution of the sample mean, which we're going to talk more and more about over the next few videos, normally the sample refers to the set of samples from your distribution. And the sample size tells you how many you actually took from your distribution. But the terminology can be very confusing, because you could easily view one of these as a sample. But we're taking four samples from here. We have a sample size of four. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to average them. So let's say the mean-- I want to be very careful when I say average. The mean of this first sample of size 4 is what? 1 plus 1 is 2. 2 plus 3 is 5. 5 plus 6 is 11. 11 divided by 4 is 2.75. That is my first sample mean for my first sample of size 4. Let me do another one. My second sample of size 4, let's say that I get a 3, a 4. Let's say I get another 3. And let's say I get a 1. I just didn't happen to get a 6 that time. And notice I can't get a 2 or a 5. It's impossible for this distribution. The chance of getting a 2 or 5 is 0. So I can't have any 2s or 5s over here. So for the second sample of sample size 4, my second sample mean is going to be 3 plus 4 is 7. 7 plus 3 is 10 plus 1 is 11. 11 divided by 4, once again, is 2.75. Let me do one more, because I really want to make it clear what we're doing here. So I do one more. Actually, we're going to do a gazillion more. But let me just do one more in detail. So let's say my third sample of sample size 4-- so I'm going to literally take 4 samples. So my sample is made up of 4 samples from this original crazy distribution. Let's say I get a 1, a 1, and a 6 and a 6. And so my third sample mean is going to be 1 plus 1 is 2. 2 plus 6 is 8. 8 plus 6 is 14. 14 divided by 4 is 3 and 1/2. And as I find each of these sample means-- so for each of my samples of sample size 4, I figure out a mean. And as I do each of them, I'm going to plot it on a frequency distribution. And this is all going to amaze you in a few seconds. So I plot this all on a frequency distribution. So I say, OK, on my first sample, my first sample mean was 2.75. So I'm plotting the actual frequency of the sample means I get for each sample. So 2.75, I got it one time. So I'll put a little plot there. So that's from that one right there. And the next time, I also got a 2.75. That's a 2.75 there. So I got it twice. So I'll plot the frequency right there. Then I got a 3 and 1/2. So all the possible values, I could have a three, I could have a 3.25, I could have a 3 and 1/2. So then I have the 3 and 1/2, so I'll plot it right there. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep taking these samples. Maybe I'll take 10,000 of them. So I'm going to keep taking these samples. So I go all the way to S 10,000. I just do a bunch of these. And what it's going to look like over time is each of these-- I'm going to make it a dot, because I'm going to have to zoom out. So if I look at it like this, over time-- it still has all the values that it might be able to take on, 2.75 might be here. So this first dot is going to be-- this one right here is going to be right there. And that second one is going to be right there. Then that one at 3.5 is going to look right there. But I'm going to do it 10,000 times. Because I'm going to have 10,000 dots. And let's say as I do it, I'm going just keep plotting them. I'm just going to keep plotting the frequencies. I'm just going to keep plotting them over and over and over again. And what you're going to see is, as I take many, many samples of size 4, I'm going to have something that's going to start kind of approximating a normal distribution. So each of these dots represent an incidence of a sample mean. So as I keep adding on this column right here, that means I kept getting the sample mean 2.75. So over time. I'm going to have something that's starting to approximate a normal distribution. And that is a neat thing about the central limit theorem. So an orange, that's the case for n is equal to 4. This was a sample size of 4. Now, if I did the same thing with a sample size of maybe 20-- so in this case, instead of just taking 4 samples from my original crazy distribution, every sample I take 20 instances of my random variable, and I average those 20. And then I plot the sample mean on here. So in that case, I'm going to have a distribution that looks like this. And we'll discuss this in more videos. But it turns out if I were to plot 10,000 of the sample means here, I'm going to have something that, two things-- it's going to even more closely approximate a normal distribution. And we're going to see in future videos, it's actually going to have a smaller-- well, let me be clear. It's going to have the same mean. So that's the mean. This is going to have the same mean. So it's going to have a smaller standard deviation. Well, I should plot these from the bottom because you kind of stack it. One you get one, then another instance and another instance. But this is going to more and more approach a normal distribution. So this is what's super cool about the central limit theorem. As your sample size becomes larger-- or you could even say as it approaches infinity. But you really don't have to get that close to infinity to really get close to a normal distribution. Even if you have a sample size of 10 or 20, you're already getting very close to a normal distribution, in fact about as good an approximation as we see in our everyday life. But what's cool is we can start with some crazy distribution. This has nothing to do with a normal distribution. This was n equals 4, but if we have a sample size of n equals 10 or n equals 100, and we were to take 100 of these, instead of four here, and average them and then plot that average, the frequency of it, then we take 100 again, average them, take the mean, plot that again, and if we do that a bunch of times, in fact, if we were to do that an infinite time, we would find that we, especially if we had an infinite sample size, we would find a perfect normal distribution. That's the crazy thing. And it doesn't apply just to taking the sample mean. Here we took the sample mean every time. But you could have also taken the sample sum. The central limit theorem would have still applied. But that's what's so super useful about it. Because in life, there's all sorts of processes out there, proteins bumping into each other, people doing crazy things, humans interacting in weird ways. And you don't know the probability distribution functions for any of those things. But what the central limit theorem tells us is if we add a bunch of those actions together, assuming that they all have the same distribution, or if we were to take the mean of all of those actions together, and if we were to plot the frequency of those means, we do get a normal distribution. And that's frankly why the normal distribution shows up so much in statistics and why, frankly, it's a very good approximation for the sum or the means of a lot of processes. Normal distribution. What I'm going to show you in the next video is I'm actually going to show you that this is a reality, that as you increase your sample size, as you increase your n, and as you take a lot of sample means, you're going to have a frequency plot that looks very, very close to a normal distribution.",math_ap-statistics_sampling-distribution-ap
" As promised, let's do a couple of simple Snell's law examples. So let's say, that I have two media-- I guess the plural of mediums. So let's say I have air right here. And then right here is the surface. Let me do that in a more appropriate color. That is the surface of the water. And I know that I have a light ray, coming in with an incident angle of-- so relative to the perpendicular-- 35 degrees. And what I want to know is what the angle of refraction will be. So it will refract a little bit. It will bend inwards a little bit, since this outside's going to be in the air a little longer, if you buy into my car travelling into the mud analogy. So it will then bend a little bit. And I want to figure out what this new angle will be. I want to figure out the angle of refraction. I'll call that theta 2. What is this? This is just straight up applying Snell's law. And I'm going to use the version using the refraction indices, since we have a table here from the ck12.org FlexBook on the refraction indices-- and you can go get it for free if you like. And that just tells us that the refraction index for the first medium-- that is air-- times the sine of the incident angle, in this case is 35 degrees, is going to be equal to the refraction index for water, times the sine of this angle right over here-- times the sine of theta 2. And we know what the refraction index for air and for water is, and then we just have to solve for theta 2. So let's just do that. The refraction index for air is this number right over here, 1.00029. So it's going to be, there's three 0's, 1.00029 times the sine of 35 degrees, is going to be equal to the refraction index for water, which is 1.33. So it's 1.33 times sine of theta 2. Now we can divide both sides of this equation by 1.33. On this side, we're just left with the sine of theta 2. On the left-hand side, let's get our calculator out for this. So let me get the handy calculator. And so we want to calculate-- and I made sure my calculator is in degree mode-- 1.00029 times the sine of 35 degrees, so that's the numerator of this expression right here-- the green part-- that's 0.5737 divided by 1.33. I'm just dividing by the numerator here. When you just divide this answer, it means your last answer. That's the numerator up here divided by that denominator. And so I get 0.4314. I'll just round a little bit. So I'll get-- I'll switch colors-- 0.4314 is equal to sine of theta 2. And now to solve for theta, you just have to take the inverse sine of both sides of this. This doesn't mean sine to the negative 1. You could also use the arcsine. The sine inverse of 0.4314 is going to be equal to-- the inverse sine of sine is just the angle itself or, I guess when we're dealing with angles in a normal range, it's going to be the angle itself. And that's going to be the case with this right over here. And if any of that is confusing you might want to review the videos on the inverse sine and the inverse cosine, and they're in the Trigonometry playlist. But we can very easily figure out the inverse sine for this right over here. You literally, you have sine here, when you press Second you get the inverse sine. So it's the inverse sine, or the arcsine of that number right over there. And instead of retyping it, I can just put Second, and then Answer. So I'm taking the inverse sine of that number. And that will give me an angle. And I get 25.55, or I'll round it, 25.6 degrees. So this theta 2, is equal to 25.6, or I'll say approximately equal to some 25.6 degrees. So Snell's law goes with our little car driving in to the mud analogy. It's going to be a narrow degree. It's going to come inwards a little bit closer to vertical. And theta 2 is equal to 25.6 degrees. And you could do the other way. Let's do another example. Let's say that we have, just to make things simpler, that I have some surface right over here. So this is some unknown material. And we're traveling in space, we're on the space shuttle, and so this is a vacuum. Or pretty darn close to a vacuum. And I have light coming in at some angle, just like that. Let me drop a vertical. So it's coming in at some angle. Actually, let me make it interesting. Let me make the light go from the slower medium to the faster medium, just because the last time we went from the faster to the slower. So it's in a vacuum. So let's say I have some light traveling like this. And once again, just to get the ""get"" of whether it's going to bend inward or bend outward, the left side is going to get out first, so is going to travel faster first. So it will bend inwards when it goes into the faster material. So this is some unknown. This is some unknown material, where light travels slower. And let's say we were able to measure, the angles. So let me drop a vertical right here. And so let's say that this right here, is 30 degrees. And let's say we're able to measure the angle of refraction. And the angle of refraction over here is, let's say that this is 40 degrees. So given that we're able to measure the incident angle, and the angle of refraction, can we figure out the refraction index for this material? Or even better, can we figure out the speed of light in that material? So let's figure out the refraction index first. So we know the refraction index for this questionable material times the sine of 30 degrees is going to be equal to the refraction index for a vacuum. Well, that's just the ratio of the speed of light in the vacuum to the speed of light in the vacuum. So that's just going to be 1. This is the same thing as n for a vacuum-- and I'll just write a 1 there-- times the sine of 40 degrees. Or If we wanted to solve for this unknown refraction index, we just divide both sides of the equation by sine of 30. So our unknown refraction index is going to be-- this is just the sine of 40 degrees-- over this-- over the sine of 30 degrees. So we can get our handy calculator out. And so we have the sine of 40 divided by the sine of 30 degrees. Make sure you're in degree mode, if you try this. And you get, let's just round it, 1.29. So this is approximately equal to-- so our unknown refraction index for our material is equal to 1.29. So we were able to figure out the unknown refraction index. And we can actually use this to figure out the velocity of light in this material. Because remember, this unknown refraction index is equal to the velocity of light in a vacuum, which is 300 million meters per second, divided by the velocity in this material, the unknown material. So we know that 1.29 is equal to the velocity of light in a vacuum. So we could write 300 million meters per second, divided by the unknown velocity in this material. I'll put a question mark. And so we can multiply both sides times our unknown velocity. I'm running out of space over here, I have other stuff written over here. So I could multiply both sides by this v and I'll get 1.29 times this v with a question mark, is going to be equal to 300 million meters per second. And then I could divide both sides by 1.29. v question mark is going to be this whole thing, 300 million divided by 1.29. Or another way to think of it is, light travels 1.29 times faster in a vacuum than it does in this material right over here. But let's figure out it's velocity. So in this material, light will travel a slow-- so the 300 million divided by 1.29. Light will travel a super slow 232 million meters per second. 1So this is approximately, just to round off, 1232 million meters per second. 1And if we had to guess what this material is, 1let's see-- I just made up these numbers-- 1but let's see if there's something that has a refraction 1index close to 1.29. 1So that's pretty close to 1.29 here. 1So maybe this is some type of interface 1with water in a vacuum, where the water somehow 1isn't actually evaporating because 1of the lack of pressure. 1Or maybe it's some other material. 1Let's keep it that way, maybe it's 1some type of solid material. 1But anyway, those were, hopefully, 1two fairly straightforward Snell's law problems. 1In the next video, I'll do a slightly more involved one.",science_ap-physics-2_ap-geometric-optics
" In the last video, we hopefully set up some of the intuition for why - or I should say what - the Maclaurin series is all about, and I said at the end of the videos that a Maclaurin series is just a special case of a Taylor series. In the case of a Maclaurin series, we're approximating this function around x is equal to 0, and a Taylor series, and we'll talk about that in a future video, you can pick an arbitrary x value - or f(x) value, we should say, around which to approximate the function. But with that said, let's just focus on Maclaurin, becuase to some degree it's a little bit simpler, and that by itself can lead us to some pretty profound conclusions about mathematics, and that's actually where I'm trying to get to. So let's take the Maclurin series of some interesting functions and I'm gonna do functions where it's pretty easy to take the derivatives, and you can /keep/ taking their derivatives over and over and over and over and over again. So let's take the Maclaurin series of cosine of x, so if f(x)=cos(x), then - before I even apply this formula, that we somewhat derived in the last video, or at least got the intuitive for in the last video - let's take a bunch of derivatives of f(x), just so we have a good sense of it. So, if we take the first derivative, if we take the first derivative, derivative of cos(x) = -sin(x) if we take the derivative of that, if we take the derivative of that, derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), and we have the negative there, so it's -cos(x) so if we take the derivative of that, so this is the third derivative of cos(x), now it's just going to be positive sine of x, and if we take the derivative of that, we get cos(x) again. We get cosine of x again. So if we take the derivative of that, this is the fourth derivative, I should, I should use this notation but you get the idea, we'll get cos(x) again. And if you look at what we talked about in the last video, we want the difference - we want the function, and we want it's various derivatives evaluated at 0, so let's evaluate it at 0. So f(0), cos(0) is 1, cosine of zero is one. Whether you're talking about zero radians or zero degrees, doesn't matter, sine of zero is zero, so this is f prime of - f prime of zero, is zero. And then cos(0) is, once again, one, but we have the negative out there, so it becomes negative one. So f - the second derivative evaluated at zero is negative one. Let's take the third derivative, the third derivative evaluated at zero well, sine of zero is just zero, and then the fourth derivative evaluated at zero, cosine of zero is one. So f prime prime prime at zero is now equal to one. So you see an interesting pattern here - one, zero, negative one, zero, one, then you go to zero, then you go to negative one, zero. So if we were to apply this to find it's Maclaurin representation, what would we get? Let me do my best attempt at this. So we would get, our polynomial would be - so our polynomial approximation of cosine of x is going to be f(0), f(0) is one, and then we have one plus f'(0) times x. But f'(0) is just zero, so we're not going to have this term over there, it's going to be zero times x, I won't even take the trouble of writing it down, it would be this zero time x, then plus f prime prime or second derivative, which is negative one, so I'll write negative - negative, this is a negative one right here, this is a negative one, times x squared, times x squared, over 2 factorial - over two factorial, which in this case is just going to be two. But I'll just write it down here as two factorial, to make the pattern a little bit more obvious, and then we go to the next term, the third derivative evaluated at zero but the third derivative evaluated at zero is just zero, so this term won't be there as well, then you go to the fourth derivative, the fourth derivative evaluated at zero is positive one, so this coefficient right here is going to be a one, and so you're going to have one times x to the fourth over four factorial, so plus x to the fourth over four factorial, and I think you start seeing a pattern now. You have sign switches - and you would see this if we kept going, so you can verify it for yourself if you don't believe me - so you have a positive sign, a negative sign, a positive sign, and then a negative sign, so on and so forth, and this is, uh, one times x to the zeroth power, then you jump two to x to the squared, jump two to x to the fourth, and so if we kept that up, we'd have a positive sign, now we have a negative sign, it would be x to the sixth over six factorial, then you have a positive sign, x to the eighth over eight factorial, and then you'd have a negative sign, x to the tenth over ten factorial, and you can just keep going that way. And if you kept going with this series, this would be the polynomial representation of cosine of x. And it's frankly just kind of cool that if can be represented this way. It's a pretty simple pattern here for a trigonometric function. Once again, it kind of tells you that all of this math is connected. And we'll see, two or three videos from now, it's connected in far more profound ways then you can possibly imagine.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-series
" Let's say we have a pipe again-- this is the opening-- and we have fluid going through it. The fluid is going with a velocity of v1, the pressure entering the pipe is P1, and then the area of this opening of the pipe is A1. It could even go up, and the other end is actually even smaller. The fluid-- the liquid-- is exiting the pipe with velocity v2, the pressure that it exerts as it goes out. If there was a membrane on the outside, how much pressure would it exert on it as it pushes it out on the adjacent water is P2, and the area of the smaller opening-- it doesn't have to be smaller-- is A2. Let's say that this opening is at a height, on average, of h1, and the water exiting this opening is on average at a height of h2. We won't worry too much about the differential between the top of the pipe and the bottom of the pipe-- we'll assume that these h's are much bigger relative to the size of the pipe. With that set up-- and remember, there's fluid going through this thing-- let's go back to what keeps showing up, which is the law of conservation of energy, which is in any closed system, the amount of energy that you put into something is equal to the amount of energy that you get out. So energy in is equal to energy out. What's the energy that you put into a system, or that the system starts off with at this end? It's the work that you input plus the potential energy at that point of the system, plus the kinetic energy at that point of the system. Then we know from the conservation of energy that that has to equal the output work plus the output potential energy plus the output kinetic energy. A lot of times in the past, we've just said that the potential energy input plus the kinetic energy input is equal to the potential energy output plus the kinetic energy output, but the initial energy in the system can also be done by work. So we just added work to this equation that says that the energy in is equal to the energy out. With that information, let's see if we can do anything interesting with this pipe that I've drawn. So what's the work that's being put into this system? Work is force times distance, so let's just focus on this. It's the force in times the distance in, and so over a period of time, t, what has been done? We learned in the last video that over a period of time, t, the fluid here might have moved this far. What is this distance? This distance is the input velocity times whatever amount of time we're dealing with, so T-- so that's the distance. What's the force? The force is just pressure times area, and we can figure that out by just dividing force by, area and then multiply by area, so we get input force divided by area input, times area input. It's divided and multiplied by the same number-- that's pressure, that's area. It's equal to the input distance over that amount of time, and that's velocity times time, so the work input is equal to the input pressure times the input area times input velocity times time. What is this area times velocity times time, times this distance? That's the volume of fluid that flowed in over that amount of time. So that equals the volume of fluid over that period of time, so we could call that volume in, or volume i-- that's the input volume. We know that density is just mass per volume, or that volume times density is equal to mass, or we know that volume is equal to mass divided by density. The work that I'm putting into the system-- I know I'm doing a lot of crazy things, but it'll make sense so far-- is equal to the input pressure times the amount of volume of fluid that moved over that period of time. That volume of fluid is equal to the mass of the fluid that went in at that period of time, and we'll call that the input mass, divided by the density. Hopefully, that makes a little bit of sense. As we know, the input volume is going to be equal to the output volume, so the input mass-- because the density doesn't change-- is equal to the output mass, so we don't have to write an input and output for the mass. The mass is going to be constant; in any given amount of time, the mass that enters the system will be equivalent to the mass that exits the system. There we go: we have an expression, an interesting expression, for the work being put into the system. What is the potential energy of the system on the left-hand side? The potential energy of the system is going to be equal to that same mass of fluid that I talked about times gravity times this input height-- the initial height-- times h1. The initial kinetic energy of the fluid equals the mass of the fluid-- this mass right here, of that same cylinder volume that I keep pointing to-- times the velocity of the fluid squared. We remember this from kinetic energy divided by 2. So what's the total energy at this point in the system over this period of time? How much energy has gone into the system? It's going to be the work done, which is the input pressure-- I'm running out of space, so let me erase all of this. I'll probably have to run out of time, too, but that's OK-- it's better than being confused. Back to what we were doing. So, the total energy going into the system is the work being done into the system, and I rewrote it in this format, which is the input pressure-- we'll call that P1-- times the mass divided by the density of the liquid, whatever it is. This is work in plus-- and what's the potential energy? I wrote it right here-- that's just mgh, where m is the mass of this volume of fluid, h is its average height, and you could almost think of how high the center of mass above the surface of the planet. Since we have a g here, we assume we're on Earth, so this is h1, because the height actually changes, so this is potential energy input plus the kinetic energy mv1 squared over 2. That is the kinetic energy input. We know that this has to equal the energy coming out of the system. This is going to be equal to the same thing on the output side. This is going to be equal to the work out, so that'll be the output pressure times the mass divided by the density plus the output potential energy, which will just be mg h2, plus the outbound kinetic energy, which will be mv2 1squared divided by 2. 1I just realized I'm out of time. 1I will continue this in the next video. 1See you soon.",science_ap-physics-2_ap-fluids
" - We're now going to talk about one of the most famous operons, and this is the lac operon, and it is part of E. coli's genome and it is involved. And the lac right over here is referring to lactose, and so you can imagine that it codes for genes involved in the metabolism of lactose. And the word lactose might already be familiar to you. It is a sugar found in milk. Some of us, including myself, are lactose intolerant. I have trouble digesting lactose, so I have mixed feelings regarding this. But in general, for a cell to make use of it, it needs to be able to absorb the lactose. It needs to be able to split it up into simpler sugars that it can actually use for fuel, and that is what the genes in the lac operon actually do code for. So just as an example, the lac Z gene right over here, this codes for an enzyme that helps cleave the lactose into simpler sugars. The lac Y gene codes for an enzyme that allows for the absorption of lactose through cellular membranes. Lac A is a little bit more interesting and a little less understood, but the general idea here is all three of these are involved in the metabolism and the absorption of lactose. And it is an operon, so we have our promoter here where our RNA polymerase would attach, and I've also drawn some other sites. I've drawn the operator right over here where you can imagine a repressor, indeed the lac repressor could bind, and over here, this CAP site, or C-A-P site. CAP stands for Catabolite Activator Protein. Catabolite, Catabolite Activator, whoops, Activator Protein. And so this is, you can imagine, where a protein, called the Catabolite Activator Protein, can bind and perhaps be an activator. So with that out of the way, let's think about different scenarios. Let's think about a scenario where the E. coli is an environment where there is no lactose. So what do you think should happen over here? And a lot of these things are very logical if you just assume that a lot of biological organisms are quite stingy. They don't wanna just waste resources. Well, if there's no lactose, well, why transcribe the genes that can be translated into enzymes for the metabolism of lactose? So if there's no lactose, you can almost do this as a default state right over here. You actually have the lac repressor protein being bound to the operator. So this is the lac repressor, lac repressor right over there, and so you won't be able to transcribe these things. The RNA polymerase won't be able to get anything done. No transcription is going to occur. So no lactose, no transcription, which makes a lot of sense. The bacteria, or the bacterium, this is singular, doesn't wanna waste resources. So what do you think should happen if there is lactose? So I'll keep this up here so you can see it. So lactose present, lactose present, well, you can imagine, well, you don't want that repressor around anymore, and that is indeed what happens, that you have an isomer of lactose, called Allolactose. So if lactose is present, you're going to have also Allolactose present, right over here, and so that is Allolactose, which can act as an inducer of transcription. And the way that it acts as an inducer is if it binds to the lac repressor, the lac repressor can no longer bind to the operator site. When the Allolactose is present, it will bind to the repressor, and then the repressor is going to leave the operator site. It's not going to be able to bind as well, and so let me draw that. So in this case, the operator, sorry, the repressor I should say. The operator is where the repressor binds. So this is the repressor right over here. You have some Allolactose. We do that in white. You have some Allolactose that has bound to it, and because of that, it's not going to bind to the operator, and since it's not bound to the operator, well now, the RNA polymerase can actually transcribe these genes, and that's valuable because by transcribing these genes, we are going to be able to metabolize this lactose. So lactose present, you have transcription. Transcription occurs. Now that's a very high level simple view of the lac operon, but there's more involved, because there's other sugars, in particular glucose, which is preferred by the cell. So, whoops, moving the wrong part. There you go. So let's think about what will happen in the presence of glucose and not in the presence of glucose. So let me write here. So glucose, and no glucose, actually let me do it, I'll do no glucose first. So let's see, we have no glucose. And remember, glucose is preferred to lactose. Simpler sugar. If you have glucose around, why worry about the lactose? And then here we have glucose. We have glucose around. And we could talk about both of these situations in the presence of lactose or not in the presence of lactose, but if we don't any lactose around, then were not gonna have the Allolactose around, and then you're just gonna have the repressor sit on the operator, and you're not going to have any transcription, and that's going to be whether or not we have glucose. So I'm gonna think about no glucose, but we do have lactose, plus lactose, and in here, you have glucose plus lactose. Well, the lactose part, if we have lactose around then we're going to have the Allolactose around, and we just covered this scenario. The Allolactose binds to the lac repressor, keeps the lac repressor from binding to the operator, and so you have your RNA polymerase is able to actually perform the transcription. But that's not it. In a situation with no glucose, you actually are going to also involve the CAP site. You're going to have an activator that's going to make this happen even more, because if you don't have glucose around, man, you really need that lactose. And so, what you have is something called, so let me draw this, the Catabolite Activator Protein, right over here. The Catabolite Activator Protein, and in the presence of Cyclic AMP, Adenosine Monophosphate. It's a derivative of ATP, and so this is that right over there, Cyclic AMP. You'll see that come up a lot in biology. So this is the Catabolite Activator Protein, in the presence of C AMP, and we'll talk about how Cyclic AMP relates to glucose in a second. In that presence, it is going to bind to this, the CAP site, and it is going to further activate the transcription. So in this situation, no glucose plus lactose, you're going to have even more transcription. So let me write this down. Lots of transcription. Lots of transcription. Now, I know what you're probably asking. This is what I first asked myself when people told me about Cyclic AMP, ""Well, how does Cyclic AMP relate to glucose?"" Well, I'm not gonna go into a huge amount of detail here, but what you need to know here, and it makes sense, is that if you have glucose, so let me write it this way. If you have high glucose, high glucose. I'm having trouble writing. High glucose, then that's going to inhibit the production of Cyclic AMP, so low Cyclic adenosine monophosphate. And if you have low glucose, or no glucose, it's like a tongue twister. If you have low glucose, well, you're not going to inhibit the creation of Cyclic AMP, and so you're going to have high Cyclic AMP. So if you have no glucose, or low glucose, we are in this scenario right over here. You're going to have higher concentrations of Cyclic AMP, which can bind to the Catabolite Activator Protein, which then acts as an activator to allow even more transcription of the lac operon. Which, once again, why is it important? Well, if there's no glucose or low glucose, you're really going to need that lactose. You really wanna transcribe these genes as much as possible. Now, what about the situation where there is glucose and lactose? Well once again, if there is lactose, then you are going to have Allolactose, which is going to be able to bind to the lac repressor, and by it binding to the lac repressor, the lac repressor is not going to be able to bind to the operator. And so you do have, once again, the RNA polymerase is going to be able to transcribe. 1But because you have glucose present, 1you're going to have low or, 1well I'll just write low, 1Cyclic AMP. 1And since you have low or no Cyclic AMP around, 1well, that Cyclic AMP isn't going to be able 1to bind to the Catabolite Activator Protein, 1and so the Catabolite Activator Protein isn't going 1to be able to act as an activator. 1I know I'm using a lot of words multiple times. 1And so it's not going to bond to the activator site, 1or to the CAP site, 1and so you're going to have less transcription. 1Less transcription, 1which once again makes sense. 1You've got glucose and lactose around. 1The cell would prefer to use glucose. 1Simpler sugar. 1Why waste resources? 1You have plenty of energy around, 1just go straight to the glucose. 1But if you don't have glucose around, 1well then use more resources 1so that you can digest the lactose.",science_ap-biology_gene-expression-and-regulation
" What is the type of this quadrilateral? Be as specific as possible with the given data. So it clearly is a quadrilateral. We have four sides here. And we see that we have two pairs of parallel sides. Or we could also say there are two pairs of congruent sides here as well. This side is parallel and congruent to this side. This side is parallel and congruent to that side. So we're dealing with a parallelogram. Let's do more of these. So here it looks like a same type of scenario we just saw in the last one. We have two pairs of parallel and congruent sides, but all the sides aren't equal to each other. If they're all equal to each other, we'd be dealing with a rhombus. But here, they're not all equal to each other. This side is congruent to the side opposite. This side is congruent to the side opposite. That's another parallelogram. Now this is interesting. We have two pairs of sides that are parallel to each other, but now all the sides have an equal length. So this would be a parallelogram. And it is a parallelogram, but they're saying to be as specific as possible with the given data. So saying it's a rhombus would be more specific than saying it's a parallelogram. This does satisfy the constraints for being a parallelogram, but saying it's a rhombus tells us even more. Not every parallelogram is a rhombus, but every rhombus is a parallelogram. Here, they have the sides are parallel to the side opposite and all of the sides are equal. Let's do a few more of these. What is the type of this quadrilateral? Be as specific as possible with the given data . So we have two pairs of sides that are parallel, or I should say one pair. We have a pair of sides that are parallel. And then we have another pair of sides that are not. So this is a trapezoid. But then they have two choices here. They have trapezoid and isosceles trapezoid. Now an isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid where the two non-parallel sides have the same length, just like an isosceles triangle, you have two sides have the same length. Well we could see these two non-parallel sides do not have the same length. So this is not an isosceles trapezoid. If they did have the same length, then we would pick that because that would be more specific than just trapezoid. But this case right over here, this is just a trapezoid. Let's do one more of these. What is the type of this quadrilateral? Well we could say it's a parallelogram because all of the sides are parallel. But if we wanted to be more specific, you could also see that all the sides are the same. So you could say it's a rhombus, but you could get even more specific than that. You notice that all the sides are intersecting at right angles. So this is-- if we wanted to be as specific as possible-- this is a square. Let me check the answer. Got it right.",math_geometry_hs-geo-foundations
" Write 7/4 as a mixed number. So right now it's an improper fraction. 7 is larger than 4. Let's write it is a mixed number. So first I'm just going to show you a fairly straightforward way of doing it and then we're going to think a little bit about what it actually means. So to figure out what 7/4 represents as a mixed number, let me write it in different colors. So this is going to be equal to-- the easiest way I do it is you say, well, you divide 4 it 7. If we're dealing with fourths, 4 goes into 7 a total of one time. Let me do this in another color. 1 times 4 is 4. And then what is our remainder? 7 minus 4 is 3. So if we wanted to write this in plain-- well, let me just do the problem, and then we'll think about what it means in a second. So you see that 4 goes into 7 one time, so you have one whole here, and then how much do you have left over? Well, you have 3 left over, and that comes from right over there. That is the remainder when you divide 4 into 7. 3 left over, but it's 3 of your 4, or 3/4 left over. So that's the way we just converted it from an improper fraction to a mixed number. Now, it might seem a little bit like voodoo what I just did. I divided 4 into 7, it goes one time, and then the remainder is 3, so I got 1 and 3/4. But why does that make sense? Why does that actually makes sense? So let's draw fourths. Let's draw literally 7 fourths and maybe it'll become clear. So let's do a little square as a fourth. So let's say I have a square like that, and that is 1/4. Now, let's think about what seven of those mean, so let me copy and paste that. Copy and then paste it. So here I have 2 one-fourths, or you could see I have 2/4. Now I have 3 one-fourths. Now, I have 4 one-fourths. Now this is a whole, right? I have 4 one-fourths. This is a whole. So let me start on another whole. So now I have 5. Now I have 6 one-fourths, and now I have 7 one-fourths. Now, what does this look like? So all I did is I rewrote 7/4, or 7 one-fourths. I just kind of drew it for you. Now, what does this represent? Well, I have 4 fourths here, so this is 4/4. This right here is 3/4. Notice, 7/4 is 4/4 with 3/4 left over. So let me write it this way. 7/4 is 4/4 with 3/4 left over. Now what is 4/4? 4/4 is one whole. So you have one whole with 3/4 left over, so you end up with 1 and 3/4. So that is the 3/4 part and that is your one whole. Hopefully that makes sense and hopefully you understand why it connects. Because you say, well, how many wholes do you have? When you're dividing the 4 into the 7 and getting the one, you're essentially saying how many wholes? So the number of wholes, or you can imagine, the number of whole pies. And then how many pieces do we have left over? Well, we have 3 pieces and each piece is 1/4, so we have 3/4 left over. So we have one whole pie and three pieces, which are each a fourth left over.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_imp-fractions-2
" Let's explore another mechanism that we can have with the ketone. And actually, an aldehyde can undergo a very similar or actually the same type of reaction. So let's say that I had a ketone that looked like this. Let me draw my carbonyl group, just like that, and then it is bonded to a carbon that is bonded to two other CH3 groups. And just to make it clear, there's three hydrogens off of this carbon there implicitly. But I'm going to draw the fourth bond here, which is to a hydrogen, because this hydrogen is going to be important for this reaction. Now, we know that the oxygen has two lone pairs of electrons. Let me draw it up here. And let's just imagine it's floating around in some water, and we know that in water there is some concentration of hydronium. And let's say that one of the hydroniums is right over here. Hydronium is just positively charged, so this is right here. Let me do it in a different color. This is what water looks like. And if water gives away an electron to a proton, it looks like this. It is hydronium, and then it only has one lone pair of electrons. It gave away one of the other electrons in its other lone pair to a proton. So you can imagine a reality, where it's like, hey, I could grab that proton from this hydronium, and then this will turn back into water, and in that situation, the mechanism would look like this. Let me do it in a different color. This blue electron gets given to this proton, if they just bump into each other just right, and then the hydrogen's electron gets taken back by what will become a water molecule. So if that happens, what do our molecules now look like? So now, what was a ketone looks a little bit different than a ketone. It looks like this. I changed it to a slightly lighter color of green, so it looks like that. We have our lone pair over here, but we no longer have this lone pair. At this end, we still have this magenta electron, but now it is in a covalent bond with the blue electron, which was now given to the hydrogen proton. Let me scroll up a little bit. It was given to this hydrogen proton up here. And then this hydronium molecule, it took back an electron, and now it is just neutral water. It took back that magenta electron, so now it has two lone pairs again, so it is just neutral water. Since this oxygen up here in the carbonyl group gave away an electron, it now has a positive charge. But this is actually resoce stabilized. You could maybe see that this would be in resoce, or another resoce form of this would be-- if this guy's positive, so he wants to gain an electron, so maybe he takes an electron from this carbon, the carbon in the carbonyl group right over there. So if you takes that electron, then the other resoce form would look like this. Let me doing it in the same colors. You have now only a single bond with this oxygen up here. This carbon down here is still bonded to the same carbons, and then this carbon over here, we could call this an alpha carbon. This is an alpha carbon to the carbonyl group. It still has a hydrogen on it right over there. And this oxygen, since it gained this magenta electron, now it has two lone pairs. It has this pair over there, and then it gained this electron and this electron, so it has another lone pair. And, of course, it has the bond to the hydrogen. Since it gained an electron, it is now neutral. This carbon lost an electron, so now it is positive. So now this carbon right over here is positive, and these two are two different resoce forms, so they help stabilize each other. And the reality is actually someplace in between. I could actually draw it in brackets to show that these are two resoce structures. Now, you can imagine, just as likely-- and actually, I shouldn't just draw this as a one-way arrow, because this guy could take a hydrogen from this hydronium, or a water could take a hydrogen from this guy, so this actually could go in both directions. So let me make that clear. This could go in both directions. You could say that they're in equilibrium with each other. You're just as likely to go in that direction as you really, for the most part, are to go on the other direction. But you can now imagine, this has now turned from a carbonyl group, this has now an OH group, this has now turned into an alcohol, although we have this carbocation here, that this does not like being positive. And so you could imagine where this electron right here on this hydrogen nucleus might want to go really bad to this carbocation, and it just needs something to nab the proton off for it to go there. And the perfect candidate for that would just be a water molecule. We have this water floating around, so let me draw another water molecule, just like this. It has two lone pairs. It can act as a weak base. It can give one of its electrons to this hydrogen proton. If it does that at the exact same time, bumps into it in the exact same way, this electron can then go to the carbocation. And if that happened, you could go in either direction. This reaction is just as likely to happen as the reverse reaction, so we could put this in equilibrium. But if that were to happen, then what started off as our ketone now looks like this. We have a bond to an OH group just like this, and over here-- actually, let me draw the rest of it. We had our molecule that looked like that, but now, this electron gets giving back to this carbocation. We now have a double bond here between what was a carbonyl carbon and our alpha carbon. So now we have this double bond right over here. That hydrogen has been taken by the water, and now that is hydronium. So let me draw the water or the hydronium. So that water, it had that one lone pair, and then the other lone pair got broken up, because it gave one of the electrons to this hydrogen right over here, and it went back to being hydronium. So what happened here? We started with a ketone, and they sometimes will call this the keto form of the molecule, and then we ended up with something called the enol form. An enol comes from the fact that it is an alkene that is also an alcohol. You could even call it an alkenol. It has a double bond, and on one of the carbons that has a double bond, it has an OH group. And the whole reason I show you this mechanism is, one, just to show you a mechanism that could happen with an aldehyde or a ketone. This was a ketone, but if this was a hydrogen right here, this would have been occurring with an aldehyde. But even more, this is a pretty common mechanism that you'll see in organic chemistry classes, and actually has a lot of functions in biology, in general. And these two molecules, this ketone and this enol form, these are called tautomers. And the keto form is actually the much more stable form. In a solution, you won't see much of the enol form, but these can occur. It can spontaneously through equilibrium get to the actual enol form. And so you could imagine, these are tautomers, so this mechanism is actually called a tautomerization, and these are the keto and enol forms of the tautomers.",science_organic-chemistry_ochem-alpha-carbon-chemistry
" -  There's a lot of different ways that you could represent a linear equation. So for example, if you had the linear equation y is equal to 2x plus three, that's one way to represent it, but I could represent this in an infinite number of ways. I could, let's see, I could subtract 2x from both sides, I could write this as negative 2x plus y is equal to three. I could manipulate it in ways where I get it to, and I'm gonna do it right now, but this is another way of writing that same thing. y minus five is equal to two times x minus one. You could actually simplify this and you could get either this equation here or that equation up on top. These are all equivalent, you can get from one to the other with logical algebraic operations. So there's an infinite number of ways to represent a given linear equation, but I what I wanna focus on in this video is this representation in particular, because this one is a very useful representation of a linear equation and we'll see in future videos, this one and this one can also be useful, depending on what you are looking for, but we're gonna focus on this one, and this one right over here is often called slope-intercept form. Slope-intercept form. And hopefully in a few minutes, it will be obvious why it called slop-intercept form. And before I explain that to you, let's just try to graph this thing. I'm gonna try to graph it, I'm just gonna plot some points here, so x comma y, and I'm gonna pick some x values where it's easy to calculate the y values. So maybe the easiest is if x is equal to zero. If x is equal to zero, then two times zero is zero, that term goes away, and you're only left with this term right over here, y is equal to three. Y is equal to three. And so if we were to plot this. Actually let me start plotting it, so that is my y axis, and let me do the x axis, so that can be my x, oh that's not as straight as I would like it. So that looks pretty good, alright. That is my x axis and let me mark off some hash marks here, so this is x equals one, x equals two, x equals three, this is y equals one, y equals two, y equals three, and obviously I could keep going and keep going, this would be y is equal to negative one, this would be x is equal to negative one, negative two, negative three, so on and so forth. So this point right over here, zero comma three, this is x is zero, y is three. Well, the point that represents when x is equal to zero and y equals three, this is, we're right on the y axis. If they have a line going through it and this line contains this point, this is going to be the y- intercept. So one way to think about it, the reason why this is called slope-intercept form is it's very easy to calculate the y-intercept. The y-intercept here is going to happen when it's written in this form, it's going to happen when x is equal to zero and y is equal to three, it's gonna be this point right over here. So it's very easy to figure out the intercept, the y-intercept from this form. Now you might be saying, well it says slope-intercept form, it must also be easy to figure out the slope from this form. And if you made that conclusion, you would be correct! And we're about to see that in a few seconds. So let's plot some more points here and I'm just gonna keep increasing x by one. So if you increase x by one, so we could write that our delta x, our change in x, delta Greek letter, this triangle is a Greek letter, delta, represents change in. Change in x here is one. We just increased x by one, what's gonna be our corresponding change in y? What's going to be our change in y? So let's see, when x is equal to one, we have two times one, plus three is going to be five. So our change in y is going to be two. Let's do that again. Let's increase our x by one. Change in x is equal to one. So then if we're gonna increase by one, we're gonna go from x equals one to x equals two. Well what's our corresponding change in y? Well when x is equal to two, two times two is four, plus three is seven. Well our change in y, our change in y is equal to two. Went from five- when x went from one to two, y went from five to seven. So for every one that we increase x, y is increasing by two. So for this linear equation, our change in y over change in x is always going to be, our change in y is two when our change in x is one, or it's equal to two, or we could say that our slope is equal to two. Well let's just graph this to make sure that we understand this. So when x equals one, y is equal to five. And actually we're gonna have to graph five up here. So when x is equal to one, y is equal to, and actually this is a little bit higher, this, let me clean this up a little bit. So this one would be, erase that a little bit. Just like that. So that's y is equal to four, and this is y is equal to five. So when x is one, y is equal to five, so it's that point right over there. So our line is going to look- you only need two points to define a line, our line is going to like, let me do this in this color right over here. Our line is going to look like, is going to look, is going to look something like, is going to look, let me see if I can, I didn't draw it completely at scale, but it's going to look something like this. This is the line, this is the line, y is equal to 2x plus three. But we already figured out that its slope is equal to two, when our change in x is one, when our change in x is one, our change in y is two. If our change in x was negative one, if our change in x was negative one, our change in y is negative two. And you can see that, if from zero we went, we went down one, if we went to negative one, then what's our y going to be? Two times negative one is negative two plus three is one. So we see that, the point negative one comma one is on the line as well. So the slope here, our change in y over change in x, if we're going from between any two points on this line, is always going to be two. But where do you see two in this original equation? Well you see the two right over here. And when you write something in slop-intercept form, where you explicitly solve for y, y is equal to some constant times x to the first power plus some other constant, the second one is going to be your intercept, your y-intercept, or it's going to be a way to figure out the y-intercept, the intercept itself is this point, the point at which the line intercepts the y axis, and then this two is going to represent your slope. And that makes sense because every time you increase x by one, you're gonna multiply that by two, so you're gonna increase y by two. So this is just a, kinda of a get your feet wet with the idea of slope-intercept form, but you'll see, at least for me, this is the easiest form for me to think about what the graph of something looks like, because if you were given another, if you were given another linear equation, let's say y is equal to negative x, negative x plus two. Well immediately you say, okay look, my yintercept is going to be the point zero comma two, so I'm gonna intersect the y axis right at that point, and then I have a slope of, the coefficient here is really just negative one, so I have a slope of negative one. So as we increase x by one, we're gonna decrease y by one. Increase x by one, you're gonna decrease y by one. If you increase x by two, you're gonna decrease y by two. And so our line is gonna look something like this. Let me see if I can draw it relatively neatly. It's going to look something, I think I can do a little bit better than that. It's 'cus my graph paper is hand drawn. It's not ideal, but I think you get, you get the point. It's gonna look something like that. So from slope-intercept form, very easy to figure out what the y-intercept is, and very easy to figure out the slope. The slope here, slope here is negative one. That's this negative one right over here, and the y-intercept, y-intercept is the point zero comma two, very easy to figure out 'cus essentially that gave you the information right there.",math_algebra-home_alg-linear-eq-func
" - If we have a rectangle with base length b and height length h, we know how to figure out its area. Its area is just going to be the base, is going to be the base times the height. The base times the height. This is just a review of the area of a rectangle. Just multiply the base times the height. Now let's look at a parallelogram. And in this parallelogram, our base still has length b. And we still have a height h. So when we talk about the height, we're not talking about the length of these sides that at least the way I've drawn them, move diagonally. We're talking about if you go from this side up here, and you were to go straight down. If you were to go at a 90 degree angle. If you were to go perpendicularly straight down, you get to this side, that's going to be, that's going to be our height. So in a situation like this when you have a parallelogram, you know its base and its height, what do we think its area is going to be? So at first it might seem well this isn't as obvious as if we're dealing with a rectangle. But we can do a little visualization that I think will help. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a chunk of area from the left-hand side, actually this triangle on the left-hand side that helps make up the parallelogram, and then move it to the right, and then we will see something somewhat amazing. So I'm going to take this, I'm going to take this little chunk right there, Actually let me do it a little bit better. So I'm going to take that chunk right there. And let me cut, and paste it. So it's still the same parallelogram, but I'm just going to move this section of area. Remember we're just thinking about how much space is inside of the parallelogram and I'm going to take this area right over here and I'm going to move it to the right-hand side. And what just happened? What just happened? Let me see if I can move it a little bit better. What just happened when I did that? Well notice it now looks just like my previous rectangle. That just by taking some of the area, by taking some of the area from the left and moving it to the right, I have reconstructed this rectangle so they actually have the same area. The area of this parallelogram, or well it used to be this parallelogram, before I moved that triangle from the left to the right, is also going to be the base times the height. So the area here is also the area here, is also base times height. I just took this chunk of area that was over there, and I moved it to the right. So the area of a parallelogram, let me make this looking more like a parallelogram again. The area of a parallelogram is just going to be, if you have the base and the height, it's just going to be the base times the height. So the area for both of these, the area for both of these, are just base times height.",math_cc-sixth-grade-math_cc-6th-geometry-topic
" - So, let's set up a relationship between the variables x and y. So, let's say, so this is x and this is y, and when x is one, y is four, and when x is two, y is eight, and when x is three, y is 12. Now, you might immediately recognize that this is a proportional relationship. And remember, in order for it to be a proportional relationship, the ratio between the two variables is always constant. So, for example, if I look at y over x here, we see that y over x, here it's four over one, which is just four. Eight over two is just four. Eight halves is the same thing as four. 12 over three it's the same thing as four. Y over x is always equal to four. In fact, I can make another column here. I can make another column here where I have y over x, here it's four over one, which is equal to four. Here it's eight over two, which is equal to four. Here it's 12 over three, which is equal to four. And so, you can actually use this information, the ratio, the ratio between y and x is this constant four, to express the relationship between y and x as an equation. In fact, in some ways this is, or in a lot of ways, this is already an equation, but I can make it a little bit clearer, if I multiply both sides by x. If I multiply both sides by x, if I multiply both sides by x, I am left with, well, x divided by x, you'd just have y on the left hand side. Y is equal to 4x and you see that's the case. X is one, four times that is four. X is two, four times that is eight. So, here you go, we're multiplying by four. We are multiplying by four, we are multiplying by four. And so, four, in this case, four, in this case, in this situation, this is our constant of proportionality. Constant, constant, sometimes people will say proportionality constant. Constant of proportionality, portionality. Now sometimes, it might even be described as a rate of change and you're like well, Sal, how is this a, how would four be a rate of change? And, to make that a little bit clearer, let me actually do another example, but this time, I'll actually put some units there. So let's say that, let's say that I have, let's say that x-- Let me do this, I already used yellow, let me use blue. So let's x, let's say that's a measure of time and y is a measure of distance. Or, let me put it this way, x is time in terms of seconds. Let me write it this way. So, x, x is going to be in seconds and then, y is going to be in meters. So, this is meters, the units, and this right over here is seconds. So, after one second, we have traveled, oh, I don't know, seven meters. After two seconds, we've traveled 14 meters. After three seconds, we've traveled 21 meters, and you can verify that this is a proportional relationship. The ratio between y and x is always seven. Seven over one, 14 over two, 21 over three. But, I wanna write that in terms of it's units. So, y over x is going to be, if we look at this point right over here, it's seven meters over one second. Seven meters over one second, or it's equal to seven meters per second. If you look at it right over here, if you say y over x, it's 14 meters, 14 meters, in two seconds, in two seconds. Well, 14 over two is seven, 14 over two is seven, and then the units are meters per second. So, that's why this constant, this seven, in all of these cases we have y over x is equal to seven, that this is also sometimes considered a rate. And over here it's very clear, this is my distance per time. Now, if I wanted to write it generally, I could say that, look, if I'm dealing with a proportional relationship, it's going to be of the form, I can always construct and equation of the form, of the form, either y over x is equal to k, where k is some constant. In this first example, k was equal to four and in this second example, k is equal to seven. Or, you can just manipulate it algebraically, multiply both sides by x and you would have y is equal to, y is equal to kx, where once again k is our constant of proportionality or proportionality constant. So, this is a really, in some ways it's a very simple idea, but in a lot of ways, you'll see this showing up multiple, many, many times in your mathematical career and it's neat to be able to recognize this as a proportional relationship.",math_8th-grade-foundations-engageny_8th-m4-engage-ny-foundations
" -  Let K equal six, so that F of X is equal to one over X-squared minus six X. Find the partial fraction decomposition for the function F. Find the integral of F of X D-X. And so let's first thinl about the partial fraction decomposition for the function F. So, F of X, I could rewrite it where I factor the denominator. If I factor out an X, I get X times X minus six. So, I can rewrite this as... And this is where I'm going to decompose it into partial fractions. A over X plus B over X minus six. If I actually had to add these two, I would try to find a common denominator. The best common denominator is just to take the product of these two expressions. So I could multiply the numerator and denomenator of this first time by X minus six. X minus six. And the numerator and denominator of the second term, I can multiply it by the denominator of the other one. So times X and times X. So that would give us, let's see if I distribute the A, it would give us A X minus six A plus B X over X times X minus six. If this looks completely foreign to you, I encourage you to watch the videos on Kahn Academy on partial fraction decomposition. So let's see if we can, so what we wanna do is solve for the A's and the B's. And so let's see, if we see that these have to add up to one over X times X minus six. So these have to add up. I'm just going back to this, these have to add up. The numerator. So it has to add up to one over X times X minus six. So this numerator has to add up to one. So what we can see is is that the X terms right over here must cancel out since we have no X terms here. We have A X plus B X must be equal to zero. Or you could say, well that means A plus B is equal to zero. So we took care of that term and that term. And then we know, that this must be the constant term that adds up to one or that is equal to one. And so we also know that negative six A is equal to one. Or A is equal to, divide both sides by negative six, negative one sixth. And if A is negative one sixth, well B is going to be the negative of that. And negative one sixth plus B. I'm just substituting A back into that equation. Need to be equal to zero. And so add one sixth to both sides, you get B is equal to one sixth. So I can decompose F of X. I can decompose F of X as being equal to A over X So that's negative one sixth over X. I just write it that way. I could write it as negative one over six X or something like that. But I'll just write it like this, just be clear that this was our A. Plus B, which is one sixth over X minus six. So that right over there, that's the partial fraction decomposition for our function F. And if I want to evaluate the integral. So the integral of F of X, the indefinite integral. Well, that's where this partial fractions decomposition is going to be valuable. That's going to be the indefinite integral of negative one sixth over X plus positive one sixth over X minus six, and then we have D X. Well what's the anti-derivative of this right over here? Well the anti-derivative of one over X is the natural log of the absolute value of X. And so we can just this is going to be negative one sixth times the natural log of the absolute value of X. Anti-derivative of this part. Then plus one sixth. You could do u-substitution but you could just say ""Hey, look the derivative of this bottom part, X minus six."" That's just one. So you could say that I have that derivative laying around. So I can just take the anti-derivative with respect to that. So that's going to be one sixth times the natural log of the absolute value of X minus six, and then I have plus C. Don't forget this is an indefinite integral over here. And then you're done. And you see that partial fraction decomposition was actually quite useful. So they were helping us how to figure out this. You didn't just have to have that insight that, okay how do I evaluate this anti-derivative. Well, the they're telling us to use partial fraction decomposition.",math_calculus-all-old_ap-calc-topic

""The following inequality represents the number ""of tables, T, and chairs, C, ""she can make with 150 wooden boards."" So we can see the 150 wooden boards right over here and it looks like she uses 17 wooden boards for each table so the total amount of boards from the tables are to make the tables is 17 T. And it looks like she uses six wooden boards for each chair and that's why you take six per chair times the number of chairs. This is the total number of wooden boards she uses from the chairs. And you add them together. It can't be anymore than 150. She only has, I guess 150 wooden boards. ""Additionally, the following inequality represents ""the number of tables and chairs ""she can make with 330 nails."" So once again, she has the maximum of 330 nails. It looks like she needs 34 nails per table because the total nails from the tables is 34 nails per table times the number of tables. And then it looks like she needs 27 nails. It looks like she needs 27 nails per chair because the total nails that she uses in all of the chairs are 27 nails per chair times the number of chairs. ""Does Fleur have enough boards ""and nails to make three tables, ""to make three, ""to make three tables and nine chairs? ""And nine chairs?"" Let's see, let's look at the number of boards. To make three tables and nine chairs, she's going to use 17 times T. In this case, it's three. Shes' going to use 17 times three boards for the tables and then she is going to use, she is going to use six times the number of chairs. So six times nine chairs. Six boards per chair times nine chairs. So six times nine is the number of boards she's going to use on the chairs. So this is going to, this is the same thing as 17 times three is 51. 51 plus, six times nine is 54. So this is 54. And what is this? Is this less than or equal to 150? Is that less than or equal to 150? Let's see, 51 plus 54 is going to be 105. So that indeed is less than or equal to 150. So that checks out. So she has more than enough boards. So she has enough boards. Let me write that. Enough boards. Now let's see if she has enough nails. Let's see if she has, that came out weird, enough boards. Let's see if she has enough nails. So three tables are going to require 34 times three nails. So 34 nails per table times three tables. So 34 times three. That's how many nails for all of the tables. And then plus, if she is going to use 27 nails per chair times the nine chairs. 27 times nine. We need to figure out, is this less than or equal to 330? And so let's see. 34 times three, that is 100. No, that's 90 plus 12. So that's 102 and then 27 times nine. So let's see, that would be, was it 243? Yep, so plus 243. So it's 102 plus 243, is that less than or equal to 330? So let's see, this would be, this would end up adding up to 345. No, this is not less than or equal to 330. This is not the case. This is not true. Not true. So she does not have enough nails. So not enough, not enough nails. And so she has enough boards but not enough nails. So unless she goes and buys some nails, she's not going to be able to make these tables and chairs.",math_algebra_inequalities-systems-graphs
" Let's do a slightly more complicated two-dimensional projectile motion problem now. So in this situation, I am going to launch the projectile off of a platform. And then it is going to land on another platform. And I'm going to fire the projectile at an angle. Let me draw this a little bit better. So I'm going to fire the projectile at an angle of-- let me use a not so clean number. Let's say it is a 53-degree angle. And it's coming out of the cannon. And let me make it clear. So it's coming out-- let me do it this way, just to make it 100% clear. So this angle right over here is 53 degrees. And we are going to have it come out of the muzzle of the cannon with a velocity of 90 meters per second. And just to give ourselves a sense of the heights, or how high it's being launched from-- so from the muzzle of the cannon down to here. So this height right over here, let's say that that is 25 meters. And let's say that this height right over here is 9 meters. And so we're essentially launching this from a height of 25 meters. I know in the last video, even though I drew the cannon like this, we assumed that it was being launched from an altitude of 0 and then landing back at an altitude of 0. Here we're assuming we're launching it from an altitude of 25 meters, because that's when it's leaving the muzzle. And it's going to start decelerating at least in the vertical direction as soon as it leaves the muzzle. And then we're assuming it's not going to land back at the same altitude. It's going to land at a different altitude. So how do we think about this problem? So the first thing you'll always want to do is divide your velocity vector into its horizontal and vertical components. You use the vertical component to figure out how long it's going to stay in the air. And then you use the horizontal component to figure out, given how long it's in the air, how far did it travel. And once again, we're going to assume that air resistance is negligible. So just based on what we did in the last video-- and I'll go through all of the steps in this one, as well. So if we draw our vector, the length here is going to be 90. This is our velocity vector. The angle over here between the x-axis and our vector is 53 degrees. And let me draw the horizontal component. The horizontal component would look like this. And the vertical component-- I'll do it in orange. The vertical component would look like-- that's not orange. The vertical component will look like this. And so the vertical component of the vector-- what would be the length of this side right over here? Well, this is the opposite side. We know from basic trigonometry sine of an angle is opposite over the hypotenuse. So we know that the sine of 53 degrees is equal to this opposite side, is equal to the vertical velocity. And I could write it's the magnitude of the vertical velocity. I write that subscript y, because we're in the y direction. That's the vertical direction, over the length of the hypotenuse, over the magnitude of our original vector. Or we can get that this side right over here. If we multiply both sides by 90, we get that the magnitude of that side is going to be equal to 90 times the sine of 53 degrees. Now, if we want to do the horizontal component, the horizontal side is adjacent to this. Cosine, soh cah toa. Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. So the horizontal component of our velocity, I'll say in the x direction, over the hypotenuse, over 90, is equal to the cosine of 53 degrees. Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. Adjacent, that's this length, over 90. Multiply both sides by 90. You get that the horizontal component is equal to 90 times cosine of 53 degrees. Now, how do we figure out how long this thing stays in the air? Well, we'll use the vertical component for that. And especially since we're dealing with different levels, we can't use that more basic reasoning, that hey, whatever velocity we start off at, it's going to be the same velocity but in the opposite direction. Or the same magnitude and velocity but the opposite direction. Because we're not going to the same elevation. But what we could do is we can use the formula that we derived in the previous video. That the displacement-- let me just copy and paste this a little bit lower so we can use it. So I'll stick it right over here. So we could use this. We know that the displacement is equal to the initial velocity-- and we're dealing with the vertical direction right here-- times the change in time plus the acceleration, times the change in time squared, divided by 2. So how do we use this to figure out how long were in the air? So what is the displacement? If we're starting at 25 meters high, and we're going to 9 meters high. So over the course, while this thing is traveling, it will be displaced downwards 16 meters. Or another way to think about it is our displacement in the vertical direction is going to be equal to negative 16 meters. Let me write that a little bit bigger. Negative 16 meters, right? Because 25 minus 9 is 16. And so we can put that into the formula that we derived in the previous video. We get negative 16-- I won't write the units here just so that we don't take up too much real estate, so that at least it looks simple-- is equal to the initial velocity. We're dealing with just the vertical dimension here. So we're just dealing with the vertical. And remember, it's negative because our displacement is going to be downwards. We're losing altitude. So our vertical velocity-- we already figured that out. It is 90 times the sine of 53 degrees. Actually, let me do it in that same color. The first time we do a new type of problem, it's good to know-- so 90 times the sine of 53 degrees, times our change in time, is equal to the acceleration of-- due to the force of gravity for an object in free fall is going to be negative 9.8 meters per second squared. But we're dividing that by 2. So we're going to have minus 4.9 meters per second squared times delta t squared. Times our change in time squared. So how do we solve something like this? You can't just factor out a t and solve it. But you might recognize this is a quadratic equation right over here. And the way you solve quadratic equations is you get everything onto one side of this equation. And then you either factor it out. But more likely in this situation, we will use the quadratic formula, which we've proved in other videos and hopefully given you the intuition for it-- to actually solve for the times where your elevation, where your displacement in the vertical direction is negative 16 meters. And you'll get two solutions here. And one of the solutions will be a negative change in time. So it'll be like at sometime in the past, you were also at negative 16 meters. That's nonsensical for this problem. So we'll want to take the positive value here. So let's put all of this on one side of the equation. So let's add 16 to both sides. On the left-hand side, you just get a 0. 0 is equal to-- and I'll write it in kind of the traditional way that we're used to seeing it. I'll write the highest degree term first. So negative 4.9 times delta t squared. And then we have plus 90 sine of 53 degrees times delta t, and then plus 16. I'm going to do that in yellow. All of this is equal to 0. And this, once again, is just a quadratic equation. We can find its roots. And the roots will be in terms of delta t. We can solve for delta t using the quadratic formula. So we get delta t-- and if this is very unfamiliar to you, review the videos on Khan Academy in the algebra playlist on the quadratic formula. And if you don't know where it came from, we also prove it for you. So it's equal to negative B. B is this term right here, 1the coefficient on the delta t. 1So it's going to be negative 90 sine of 53 degrees. 1I'll write the quadratic formula up here 1for those of you who don't fully remember it. 1So if I'm trying to solve Ax squared plus Bx 1plus C is equal to 0, the roots over here 1are going to be negative B plus or minus the square root of B 1squared minus 4AC, all of that over 2 times A. 1These are going to be the x values that 1satisfy this equation up here. 1So that's all I'm doing over here. 1This is the B value. 1Negative B plus or minus-- and it's 1going to turn out that we only care about the plus one, 1because that's going to give us the positive value. 1But I'll just write it out here. 1Plus or minus the square root of B squared. 1So it's this quantity squared. 1So it is 90 sine of 53 degrees squared, minus 4-- 1we're going to run [? out that ?] little space. 1So minus 4 times A, which is negative 4.9. 1Well, let me just write negative 4.9 times C. C over here 1is 16, times 16. 1Let me put this radical all the way over here. 1All of that over 2A. 1So A is negative 4.9. 12 times A is negative 9.8. 1So now we can get the calculator out 1to figure out our change in time. 1And I'm just going to focus on the positive version of it. 1I'll leave it up to you to find the negative version 1and see that it'll give you a negative value for change 1in time. 1And that's nonsensical, so we only 1care about the positive change in time 1where we get to a displacement of negative 16 meters. 1Let's get the calculator out. 1So we get-- want to do this carefully. 1We have negative 90 sine of 53 degrees plus. 1I'm doing the plus version here because that'll give us 1the positive value-- plus the square root of. 1And I'll do this in parentheses. 190 sine of 53 degrees squared. 1That's that part right there. 1These two negatives cancel out. 1So I could say this is plus 4 times positive 4.9. 1So plus 4 times 4.9 times 16. 1And then that closes off our entire radical. 1And so this will give me the numerator up here. 1That gives me the numerator. 1And then I want to divide that by-- did I do the negative 90? 1Oh, and I just realized that I made a mistake. 1I said that the positive version would give you 1the positive time. 1But now we realize that's wrong. 1Because when I took the positive version, when I put a plus up 1here, I get a positive 2.14 for the numerator. 1But then we divide it by negative 9.8. 1We're going to get a negative value. 1So that's not going to be the time that we care about. 1We care about the time where this is a negative value. 1So let me re-enter that. 1So let me do the negative value. 1So let me move back a little bit. 1And then let me replace this with a minus sign. 1So I'm going to look at the negative value, 1because I want the positive time. 1And so now my numerator here is a negative value. 1And so this is actually what we care about. 1We care about the numerator's a negative value. 1You divide by negative 9.8, and you 1get 14.8-- I'll just round-- 14.89 seconds. 1So delta t, the positive version, 1is equal to 14.89 seconds. 1And so my initial comment about using the positive version 1was wrong because we have this denominator that's negative. 1So you want the numerator to be negative. 1And only when the numerator is negative 1will the whole expression be positive. 1And so we got this positive time of 14.89 seconds. 1I'm going to leave you there. 1And the next part of the video-- actually, I 1might as well just solve it instead of making a new video. 1Although this is running long. 1So the amount of time that we're in the air is 14.89 seconds. 1So if I were to ask you the horizontal displacement, 1it's going to be the amount of time 1we're in the air times your constant horizontal velocity. 1And we already figured out our constant horizontal velocity. 1So if you want to figure out how far along the x-axis 1we get displaced, we just take this time 1times-- that just means our previous answer-- 1times this value right here, times 90 cosine of 53 degrees. 1And that gives 806 meters. 1So this displacement right over here is 806 meters.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-class11th-physics-motion-in-a-plane
" In the last video, we figured out how to figured out the sum of the roots of a polynomial. What we're going to try to attempt to do in this video is think about the sum of the squares of the roots of a polynomial. So let's think about that a little bit. So let's say that I have a second degree polynomial that looks like this. So it's x squared plus a1x, plus a2 and this is equal to 0. We saw-- and actually, I'll just redo some of what we did in the last video, because it's going to be useful over here. This thing is going to have two roots, r1 and r2. Two roots, and that tells us that this thing can be rewritten as x minus r1, times x minus r2 is equal to 0. And if you expand this out, you get x squared minus r1 plus r2, x, plus r1r2. So that's what you get right over there. Now, let's think about it. We figured out from the last video that r1 plus r2, which is right over here, that needs to be equal to the negative of this coefficient. This a1 over here is equal to the negative of r1 plus r2. So r1 plus r2 is equal to the negative of a1. So let's see if we can use that information, right over there, to figure out what-- let me do this in a new color-- to figure out what r1 squared plus r2 squared is. So let's see how we could get that. Well, one place that we could start off with, we could start off with r1 plus r2 squared. So r1 plus r2 squared, which is, of course, the same thing as negative a1 squared, which would be the same thing as a1 squared. a1 squared-- I could put a negative here, but a negative 1 times negative 1 is obviously a positive one-- this is going to be equal to r1 squared plus 2r1r2, plus r2 squared. So this has the sum that we care about in it. Let's call this sum 1-- we're just raising the roots to the first power. Let's call this sum 2. So this over here, we've written, essentially, that sum 1 squared-- that's sum s sub 1 squared is equal to-- this plus this is s sub 2-- is equal to s sub 2 plus 2r1r2. Now, can we figure out what r1r2 is based on looking at the actual original polynomial? Well, you look over here, if you just did an expansion-- of course, I forgot to write here that this is equal to 0-- r1r2 is essentially represented by a2 over here. So to take the first degree sum, or the roots raised to the first power sum, we looked at this coefficient. Now all of a sudden, we're involving the coefficient to the right of that. We're going two degrees below the degree of the polynomial. So this, right over here, is a2. So r1r2 is a2. That's a2. This right here-- this whole expression-- is a1 squared. So if we want to solve for this sum-- if we want to solve for s sub 2, we would get s sub 2 is equal to a1 squared-- that's this over here-- minus 2 times a sub 2. So we just figured out a fast way to figure out the sum of the squares of the root of just a second degree quadratic right now. So for example, if I were to give you-- let me give you something strange. So if I were to give you 7x squared minus pi x, plus e is equal to 0. And someone said, I want you to figure out the sum of the squares of the roots of this polynomial, first you want to make the coefficient in front of the x squared 1. So divide everything by 7. So you get x squared minus pi over 7 x, plus e over 7 is equal to 0. And then you could just use the result that we just found. The sum of the square of the roots-- is this s2 over here. Whatever the roots are, you square each of them, you take their sum, and it's going to be equal to a1 squared. So it's going to be pi squared over 49. I'm just squaring this right over here, or I could just square that. The negative doesn't matter what I'm squaring. minus 2 times e over seven. And that's about as simplified as you could get this expression. So it's pi squared over 49, minus 2 e over 7, which by itself a pretty neat result. Because it would be very hard to find the roots of this. You'd get some crazy numbers, and then you'd have to square them and sum them. But we just figured out a very fast way of doing it. Now, let's see if we can extend this to the third degree. And it actually turns out you can-- not only to the third degree you can extend this to the nth degree. And I might do an induction proof it gets a little bit messier than when you just take the first degree sum, right over here, where you take the sum of the roots to the first power. But let's just see if it works for the third power. So let's say, I have the polynomial x to third plus a1x squared, plus a2x, plus a3 is equal to 0. We have three roots. r1, r2, r3, which tells us that we can rewrite this polynomial as x minus-- or this equation as x minus r1, times x minus r2, times x minus r3 is equal to 0. Now we already figured out what this part right here is, it's this thing over here. We already multiplied it out. It's this thing. It is this over here. So essentially, to get this whole expression, we just have to multiply this times this thing over here. We can just use the distributive property-- multiple this thing times each of these terms. So first, let's multiply this whole thing by x. So you get x to the third, minus r1 plus r2 times x squared, plus r1r2x. So I just multiplied this thing over here times x. Now I can just multiply this thing up here times negative r3. So negative r3 times x squared. Negative r3 times this term over here, it will give us-- well it's going to be a negative times a negative, so it's going to be a positive-- so it's positive r3 three times this. We can distribute them. We're going to get r1-- so let me make sure I'm doing. Negative r3 times this over here is going to be negative-- let me just write it like this. I don't want to skip steps. So it's going to be-- the negative and the negatives cancel out. So negative r3 times r1 plus r2 x. And then finally, you have the negative r3 times r1r2. So minus r1r2r3. And all of that's going to be equal to 0. But let's simplify it. So this thing is going to be equal to x to the third minus r1 plus r2 plus r3-- we did that in the last video. That shows us that the sum of our roots is this second coefficient here, the coefficient on the second degree term, x squared. And then, we go over here. We have r1r2, x. Then you have r1, r3 x. Plus r1r3-- I'm just distributing this. And then you have r3 times r2. So plus r2r3. All of that times x, and then minus r1r2 and r3. Now if we want to take the sum of the squares of the roots. So if we want to take r1 squared plus r2 squared plus r3 squared, well, we could try to do the same thing. We could take r1 plus r2 plus r3, which we know how to calculate-- we can square that. And we're essentially going to get-- When you square this you're going to get-- let me see if I can write it neatly. This is going to be equal to r1 times-- So I'm just going to-- let me just rewrite it. This is equal to-- just to clarify, this is equal to r1 plus r2 plus r3, times r1 plus r2 plus r3. So it's going to be-- I could start over here. r1 times r1 is r1 squared, plus r1 times r2-- so r1r2-- plus r1 times r3. And then, plus-- now we're in the r2. r2 times r1 is plus r1r2-- same thing, I'm just switching the order so it looks the same. r2 times r2 is r2 squared. And then, r2 times r3 is plus r2r3. And then let's go to the r3, r3 times r1 is just another r3r1-- I just switched the order. r3 times r2 is another r2r3. And then, r3 times r3 is r3 squared. So what did we just get here when we squared just the straight up sum? You got r1 squared plus r2 squared plus r3 squared, 1plus-- you essentially got all of the different combinations, 1but you got them twice. 1You have two r1r2, so you have 2 times r1r2. 1Then you have two r1r3, so plus r1r3-- I have the 2 out front. 1Plus r2r3. 1And this over here is equal to-- remember 1what we did-- this is equal to r1 plus r2 plus r3 squared. 1So we got essentially the same result. 1Remember, this thing right over here-- let's make things clear. 1This thing over here r1-- all the combinations 1of the products of the roots. 1If you look over here, that's exactly what 1this thing is over here, which must 1be what our a2 coefficient is. 1So this is our a2 coefficient. 1This r1 plus r2 plus r3, that is-- we 1figured out multiple times-- that's 1this thing right over here, which is going to be a1. 1So this is going to be a negative, 1or it's equal to negative a1. 1But you take negative a1 squared, 1and that's the same thing as a1 squared. 1So this is a1 squared. 1And this is the sum that we care about. 1So we get r1 squared plus r2 squared plus r3 squared 1is equal to this business over here. 1It's equal to a1 squared minus 2 times a2. 1So we got the exact same result that we 1got for the second degree case. 1And it actually turns out this will be true of any degree. 1I haven't proven to you yet, although I 1can make an induction argument now-- 1we've proven some base cases. 1But just to make it clear how to apply it, 1I give you crazy polynomial. 1I give you-- Let's do a third degree case, 1let's say, 10x to the third minus 5 x 1squared, plus 7x-- I'm making this up on the fly-- plus 2 1is equal to 0. 1And if I were to ask you the sum? 1If I were to ask you r1 squared plus r2 squared plus r3 1squared-- If I were to ask you the square of the sum 1of the roots, you just take-- well, let me be careful. 1You have to make sure that you have 1a one in front of the highest degree term. 1So this thing over here, has to be rewritten. 1Divide both sides by 10 x to the third minus 5 over 10, 1so minus 1/2 x squared, plus 7 over 10 1x, plus 2 over 10, which is one fifth is equal to 0. 1So I just divided both sides by 10, 1and yup, I did that part right. 1And now, we can apply this. 1I almost made a careless mistake. 1You have to have a one coefficient out here, at least, 1the way that we've derived this. 1So this sum is going to be equal to a1 squared. 1So it's this-- 1/2 squared. 1So a1 is actually negative 1/2, but negative 1/2 half 1squared is just one fourth. 1So it is going to be one fourth minus 2, times a2. 1So minus 2 times 7 over 10. 1So this is equal to one fourth minus 14 over 10. 1We could find a common denominator here. 1This is the same thing as 5 over 20 minus 14 over 10. 1And this is equal-- or sorry, minus 28 over 20, I should do, 1which is equal to negative 23 over 20. 1And you might say, hey, Sal, hang on. 1I'm taking the square of a bunch of roots and adding them up, 1and I'm getting a negative number. 1I thought squares-- I thought y squared numbers I always 1get a positive number that would be true if you're dealing 1with real numbers, but remember the words of a polynomial 1can be complex and complex numbers 1squared can be negative numbers. 1So this obviously is involving some type of complex roots. 1But we know that the sum when you 1take the sum of the squares of those complex roots you 1get negative 23 over 22.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_aime
" -  ""Many species have circadian rhythms ""that exhibit an approximately 24-hour cycle. ""Circadian rhythms are controlled by both genetics ""and environmental conditions, including light. ""Researchers investigated the effect of light ""on mouse behavior by using a running wheel ""with a motion sensor to record activity ""on actograms, as shown in figure one."" All right, so let's think about what figure one is showing us. We have a picture of a mouse here that seems to be inactive, definitely not on the running wheel, even eyes closed, maybe it's sleeping. And then here, a picture of a mouse that is on the running wheel, maybe running, with its eyes open. And then we see our actogram here and it describes, ""Strategy for recording mouse activity data. ""When a mouse is active on the running wheel, ""the activity is recorded as a dark horizontal line ""on an actogram. ""When the mouse is inactive, ""no dark line is recorded."" So we can see here, it gives us the activity for each day. So for day one, day one is right over here. Let me do that in a lighter color so that I don't overwrite what you need to see. So day one is right over there, and you can see from hour zero to hour 12, since we have no black line, the mouse is inactive. We're not detecting activity on the running wheel. And then when we have the black line from hour 12 to hour 24, that means we are detecting activity on the running wheel and so we can assume that the mouse is active. And then we have it again for day two, and the way this is set up, it looks like that pattern holds for every day. Let's keep going. ""For the investigation, ""adult male mice were individually housed in cages ""in a soundproof room at 25 degrees Celsius."" So they wanted to make sure that these mice didn't bother each other, that this was definitely controlled conditions. Soundproof, that they're not impacted by outside noises, other mice, a variation in temperature, so they tried to for all of these things. ""Each mouse was provided with adequate food, ""water, bedding material, and a running wheel. ""The mice were exposed to daily periods ""of 12 hours of light,"" with the capital L, ""and 12 hours of dark,"" capital D. L12, D12. So that's 12 hours of light, 12 hours of darkness, ""for 14 days, and their activity ""was continuously monitored. ""The activity data are shown in figure two."" All right, so this is an actogram of mouse activity under L12, D12 conditions. Each row represents a 24-hour period and the dark horizontal lines represent activity on the running wheel, just like we saw before. But this is actual data that we are recording. So in the first 12 hours, the mouse are in conditions where there's light, and you can see for the most part, on day one, we detect no activity. On day two, we also detective no activity. On day three, we detect a little bit of activity, but for the most part, when it's light, we detect very little to no activity. And when it's dark, it's the opposite. We detect a lot of activity on that running wheel. There's a few gaps right over here, but for the most part, the mouse is active when it's dark. So the mouse is active when it's dark and inactive when it is light, which is the opposite of most human beings, or frankly, well, definitely human beings, where we tend to be active in the light and inactive in the dark. Interesting. After 14 days, so that was just with 12 hours of light, 12 hours of darkness. ""After 14 days of L12, D12,"" so it's 12 hours of light, 12 hours darkness, ""the mice were placed in continuous darkness."" Capital D, capital D. DD, that sounds unpleasant. Continuous darkness. And their activity on the running wheel was reported as before. ""The activity data under DD,"" continuous darkness, ""conditions are shown in figure three."" All right, so this is interesting here. So it looks like on day one, the mice were inactive, not 12 hours, like we saw when we had 12 hours of light, but it looks like about 10 hours. And then from hour, I don't know, this is maybe hour nine or 10, to about hour, it looks like maybe hour 21, they were active. Maybe 12 hours, maybe a little less than 12 hours. And then inactive, active, inactive, active, but it seems to be less than for 12 hours. And then they're active for less than 12 hours. So you see everything shifting up every 24-hour period because they tend to be inactive for less than 12 hours. It looks like it's 10 or 11 hours each day. And then active for a little bit less than 12 hours. So that's why you see this shifting pattern where every day the activity starts at roughly an earlier period. It's not a perfect trend, but you see the trend over multiple days. I can draw, I can show a line that goes something like this. You can see every day we are starting activity at an earlier hour. And every day we're also ending our activity at an earlier hour. And there's a lot more, I guess you could say, sporadic activity going on. And remember, this under continuous darkness. All right, let's see if we can answer the questions. ""The nervous system plays a role in coordinating ""the observed activity pattern of mice ""in response to light-dark stimuli."" Yes, that makes sense, of course. ""Describe one role of each ""of the following anatomical structures ""in responding to light-dark stimuli."" A photoreceptor in the retina of an eye. Well, this detects light. Detects light and sends signal. Or maybe I'll say transmit signal. Transmits signal that eventually gets to brain. That eventually gets to brain. Gets to the brain. All right? The brain. Well, it receives signals. It receives. I before E, except after C. It re-see (laughs), it receives, it receives signals. It receives signals and then coordinates activity based on that. Coordinates activity response based on that. Based on signals. Based on the signals. So this is really just, you know, do we know what a photoreceptor, a brain, and a motor neuron, I guess as related to this test. And then a motor neuron, well, these are neurons that would stimulate. You tend to think of things that would be, you know, like motor movement, like muscles, but they also control things like glands. So they stimulate muscles, glands. And glands could be especially relevant here because glands might be the things that release or don't release hormones that might put the mice to sleep or wake them up. Glands that might release hormones related to sleep. Might release hormones related to sleep, wake. Related to sleep and activity. All right, so I think that's, we've taken a decent job of describing the role of each of those. All right, let's go to part B now. ""Based on an analysis of the data in figure two, ""describe the activity pattern of mice ""during the light and dark periods ""of the L12, D12 cycle."" Well, this was pretty straightforward. When there was light, so they were inactive during light. Inactive during light. Active during dark. Active during dark. I could've written the answer down below, but I think I could've squeezed this one in. That's the basic idea. L12, D12 cycle, we saw right over here. Inactive during light, and then active during the dark. All right. Active during the dark. Okay. ""The researchers claim that the genetically controlled ""circadian rhythm in the mice does not follow ""a 24-hour cycle. ""Describe one difference between the daily pattern ""of activity under L12, D12 conditions, ""figure two, and under,"" continuous darkness, the DD conditions in figure three. And ""use data to support the researchers' claim."" All right, well, we talked about this already. So under DD, mice active and inactive for less than 24, or less than 12 hours each. 12 hours each. And then we could say versus 12 hours inactivity under light, under, I could say, L12. And 12 hours activity 1under D, 1under D12. 1So under continuous darkness, 1mice active and inactive for less than 12 hours each 1versus 12 hours inactivity under L12 1and to 12 hours activity under D12 1when it was dark for 12 hours. 1So less than 124-hour cycle. 1So less than 124-hour cycle. 1Activity also more sporadic. 1Activity 1also more 1sporadic. 1Sporadic, or we could say less continuous. 1Less continuous, there's definitely more times 1where the activity periods is broken up 1by inactivity or the inactive periods 1is broken up by activity. 1Less continuous. 1All right, I feel pretty good about that. 1Now, let's see. 1Actually, since I'm already at 11 minutes in this video, 1I'll continue the next two parts in the next video.",science_ap-biology_worked-examples-ap-biology
" In this video we're going to do with the hyperbola the exact same thing we did with the circle. We're going to find constraints on the y-intercept for the tangent line in terms of m. But this time we're going to use the hyperbola. And then we can set them equal to each other, and solve for the m. So let's remind ourselves what the equation of the hyperbola is. They give it to us right over there. It's x squared over 9 minus y squared over 4 is equal to 1. Let me write this over here. So it is x squared over 9 minus y squared over 4 is equal to-- I'll write the y squared-- minus y squared over 4 is equal to 1. But now we can substitute the y squared with the y is equal to mx plus b that we got from the last video. And we actually figured out what y squared is equal to. Y squared is equal to all of this business up here. Because it's the same line. Remember, this is the whole point of it. We're trying to find two constraints on that same line. So we can rewrite this same thing. And actually one thing I want to do is I'm going to multiply both sides of this equation by 36, the common multiple of 9 and 4, so that I can get rid of these fractions. And so this is going to become 36-- let me write it this way-- so 36 divided by 9 is 4. So it's 4x squared minus-- 36 divided by 4 is 9-- and I would put a y squared here but we know that y squared is the exact same thing as this thing over here. So y squared is the same thing as m squared. x squared plus 2 mbx plus b squared. And then this is going to be equal to-- remember, we multiplied both sides of this equation by 36-- so this is going to be equal to 36. And let me simplify this. And we're going to do the exact same thing. We know that the m and b have to be such that, or the line has to have a slope and y-intercept where it'll only intersect with the hyperbola at one point. It'll only have one solution to this quadratic in terms of x. But let's simplify it first before we worry about that. So this is equal to 4 x squared minus 9 m squared x squared minus 18 mbx, minus 9 b squared. Just multiply it there. And let me subtract this 36 from both sides, so then we have minus 36 is equal to 0. So this is a quadratic in terms of x. But let me combine the various degree terms. So these are the x squared terms right over here. So this is the same thing as 4 minus 9 m squared times x squared. And then our only x term is this right over here. That's our only x term. So this is minus 18 mbx. And then our constant terms are right over here. So this over here is minus 9 b squared-- and let me write it this way, let me write it as minus 9-- well I'll just write it, minus 9 b squared minus 36. I'll just write it like that. And of course that is going to be equal to 0. And remember, quadratic formula, if we wanted to solve for the Xs, we'd have the quadratic formula, but we only want to have one solution. So the discrimit part of the quadratic formula is going to equal 0. The b squared minus 4 ac is going to be equal to 0. This is exactly what we did in the last video. So let's take the b squared minus 4ac and set that equal to 0, and then we'll have our constraints on m and b. So b squared is-- and remember don't get the squared in the quadratic formula confused with the b in the y-intercept. But this term squared is-- so this is going to be-- 18 squared m squared b squared, right? Negative 18 squared is just positive 18. Minus 4 times a. a is 4 minus 9 m squared times c. So I can rewrite c as negative 9 times b squared plus 4. Did I do that right? Negative 9 times b squared is negative 9 b squared. Negative 9 times 4 is negative 36. I want to make sure I don't make any careless mistakes. And so this becomes-- so if we just take the negative 9 and the negative 4-- they become a positive 36. They become a positive 36. And then we can actually, just to simplify things so we don't have to do too much fancy math, this 18 squared-- let's remember-- 18 squared is the same thing as-- well 18 squared is going to be divisible-- well I won't worry too much about that just yet. I just want to make sure that-- Actually let me write it this way. So 18 squared is 2 times 9 times 2 times 9. Or another way to think about it is 4 times 9 times 9. That's the same thing as 18 squared. 4 times 9 times 9. Now we can divide both of these terms-- and this whole thing, remember we want this whole thing to be equal to 0. The discrimit has to be equal to 0. So we can divide both sides of this equation by 36, which is the same thing as dividing by 4 times 9. So this term right over here, we could get rid of one 4 and one 4. And we're going to get a 9 m squared b squared over here. And then we divided by 36, so these all go away. So it's going to be 9 m squared b squared plus this thing times this thing. So let's see what that is. So we have a 4 times a b squared. So we have plus 4 b squared. Let me do this in a different color. I'll do it in blue. So plus 4 b squared. And then you have 4 times 4. So plus 16. And you have negative 9 m squared times b squared. So it's negative 9 m squared b squared. And then you have negative 9 m squared times 4. So negative 36 m squared. And that's going to be equal to 0. Lucky for us, that and that cancel out. And then we are left with something. And actually, what we're left with, everything is divisible by 4. So let's divide what we're left with by 4. So then we're left with b squared-- that's that term. And then minus 9 m squared. That's that term over there. Just divided it by 4. And then plus 4 is equal to 0. And once again, we could use-- well actually here, we don't have to do anything. We don't have to use quadratic formula. We could just solve for b. We could subtract this from both sides. And so we'll get b squared is equal to the square root of 9 m squared minus 4. Sorry-- let me just write this-- I don't want to skip steps here. b squared is equal to 9 m squared minus 4. They're painting the office right now, so maybe it's making me a little bit-- making my brain not work properly. Then b is equal to the square root of 9 m squared minus 4. Did I do that right? Let's see. I got the 4. Yeah, it looks right. And so we're left with a situation where the b-- if we're saying that if the line is tangent to the hyperbola it to be this, and if the line is tangent to the circle b has to be equal to this, this business over here. So let me copy it and then let me paste it. Let me paste it. Just like that. And so we now have two equations with two unknowns. We can set these equal to each other and solve for m. And this will give us the m or the slope of that tangent line. And then we can go ahead and solve for b. I'll do that in the next video.",math_precalculus_conics
" -  What we're going to do using our powers of calculus is find the area of this yellow region and if at any point you get inspired, I always encourage you to pause the video and try to work through it on your own. So, the key here is you might recognize hey, this is an area between curves. A definite integral might be useful, so I'll just set up the definite integral sign and so, first we're gonna think about what are left and right boundaries of our region? Well, it looks like the left boundary is where the two graphs intersect right over here and the right boundary is where they intersect right over there. Well, what is this point of intersection? It looks like it is negative one, negative two. We can verify that. In this red curve, if X is negative one, let's see, you square that, you'll get one minus three. You do indeed get Y is equal to negative two and in this blue function was X is equal to negative one, you get one minus four plus one. Once again, you do indeed get Y is equal to negative two and the same thing is true when X is equal to one. One minus three, negative two, one minus four plus one, negative two. So, our bounds are indeed, we're going from X equals negative one to X equals positive one and now let's think about our upper and lower bounds. Over that interval this blue graph is our upper bound and so, we would subtract the lower bound from the upper bound, so we would have X to the fourth, minus four X squared plus one and from that we will subtract X squared minus three DX and in many other videos we have talked about why you do this, why this makes sense to just subtract the lower graph from the upper graph when you're finding the area between them but now we just have to evaluate this definite integral, so let's just get down to business. Alright, so we have the integral from negative one to one, and so, we have X to the fourth, X to the fourth, and now we have minus four X squared and then when you distribute this negative sign, you're gonna subtract another X squared, so you're gonna have minus five X squared and then you have plus one and then you're gonna subtract a negative three, so it's gonna be one plus three, so it's gonna be plus four DX, DX and just to be clear I should put parentheses right over there because it's really the DX is being multiplied by this entire expression and so, let's see, let's find the antiderivative of this. This should be pretty straightforward. We're just gonna use the reverse power rule multiple times, so this is going to be the antiderivative of X to the fourth is X to the fifth over five. We just incremented the exponent and divided by that incremented exponent, minus, same idea here, five X to the third over three plus four X and then we are going to evaluate it at one and then subtract from that and evaluate it at negative one. So, let's first evaluate it at one. We're gonna get 1/5 minus 5/3 plus four and now let us evaluate it at negative one, so minus, let's see, if this is negative one, we get a negative 1/5, negative 1/5 and this is gonna be plus 5/3, plus 5/3 and then this is going to be minus four, minus four but then when you distribute the negative sign, we're going to distribute this over all of these terms, and so this is going to be, if we make this positive, this will be positive, this one will be negative and then this one will be positive, so you have 1/5 plus 1/5 which is going to be 2/5, that and that, and then minus 5/3, minus 5/3, so minus 10 over three and then four plus four, so plus eight and so, we just need to simplify this. This is going to be, let's see, it's going to be eight and then if I write, so plus, I'm gonna write these two with a denominator of 15 'cause that's the common denominator of three and five. Let's see, 2/5 is 16/15, yeah, that's right, five times three is 15. Two times three is six and then 10/3, let's see, if we multiply the denominator times fives, we have to multiply the numerator times five, so this is going to be 50/15 and so, what's 6/15 minus 50/15? So, this is going to be equal to eight minus six minus 50 is minus 44, minus 44 over 15 and so what is 44 over 15? 44 over 15 is equal to two and 14/15, so that's really what we're subtracting. We're gonna subtract two and 14/15, so if you subtract two from this you would get six minus 14 over 15 'cause we still have to subtract the 14/15 and then six minus 14/15 is going to be equal to five and 1/15. So, just like that, we were indeed able to figure out this area.",math_ap-calculus-ab_ab-applications-of-integration-new
" -  In previous videos, we started talking about the idea of transformations. In particular, we talked about rigid transformations. So for example, you can shift something. This would be a translation. So the thing that I'm moving around is a translation of our original triangle. You could have a rotation. So that thing that I translated, I am now rotating it as you see right over there. And you can also have a reflection. The tool that I'm using doesn't make reflection too easy. But that's essentially flipping it over a line. But what we're going to talk about in this video is a non-rigid transformation. And what makes something a rigid transformation is that lengths between points are reserved. But in a non-rigid transformation, those lengths do not need to be preserved. So for example, this rotated and translated triangle that I'm moving around right here, in fact I'm continuing to translate it as I talk. I can dilate it. And one way to think about dilation is that we're just scaling it down or scaling it up. So for example, here, I am scaling it down. That is a dilation. Or I can scale it up. This is also a dilation or even going off of the graph paper. So the whole point here's just to appreciate that we don't just have the rigid transformations, we can have other types of transformations, and a dilation is one of them in your toolkit that you will often see, especially when you get introduced to the idea of transformation.",math_geometry_hs-geo-transformations
" SALMAN KHAN: I'm here with Professor Laurence Baker from Stanford Medical School, and I'm hoping he can at least start to get me to understand something that I've always wondered about and worried about a little bit. Let's say that I'm some drug company. So let me write this down. So I'm some pharma company, pharma company A right over here, and let's say that I invest 10 years and $100 million in some drug. I get it through all of the clinical trials, and it gets approved by the FDA. And let's say, just for sake of simplicity, it cures disease x. Now once I get to that point, I'm feeling pretty good about myself as a pharma company. What happens next? I'm assuming that I'm going to have to go to the insurance companies and maybe Medicaid and Medicare and figure out how much they're going to pay for it, but how does that conversation even happen? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. So you're going to have a conversation with a bunch of different folks. In the US, we have lots of different private insurance plans. We've got government plans. And you're actually going to have conversations with Europe and with some of the other systems around the world, because each system is going to make its own decision. SALMAN KHAN: And they have a different way of doing it. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: They may some have similarities in the way that they probably want to talk to you about. SALMAN KHAN: Does there tend to be a lead system? Does it tend to be either the Europeans, or does it tend to be the private insurers in the US? Or do you just start all of those conversations at once because there's so much money on the table? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: So there will be some strategy your business is going to come to because it's very hard to have all of these conversations exactly simultaneously. So you'll talk to the US. You'll talk to Europe. And there are some cases in which people have viewed the regulatory processes in Europe as a little easier for some things, so they may want to start in Europe. But in other cases, if you're looking at a drug that maybe some of the national systems in Europe are less likely to want to pay for, you might want to start with the US, where there's a little more flexibility. SALMAN KHAN: But the general rule of thumb is all the money is in Europe and the US mainly right now. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: A lot of it. The Asian systems, some of them are pretty sophisticated and using a lot of the advanced drugs, too, but I think the majority of the money is in the US and Europe, North America. SALMAN KHAN: And between Europe and the US, I guess I've always imagined North America was maybe where the bulk of the money was. But is that the case? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: The US, well, our health care system spends more than everybody in the world, and it's true for drugs, too. We spend more on drugs here than most other places. SALMAN KHAN: OK. So definitely if I'm here, pharma company A, I want to make sure I get this right in the US. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. Eventually you probably care a lot about the US. SALMAN KHAN: Part of my investment that I made is based on some understanding that, if I got all the way through, that I would get some type of return within the US. Will I necessarily immediately go to Medicare because they're one of the largest players, or will I go to, like we talked about, Blue Cross Blue Shield or Kaiser or some of these other players? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: So Medicare is actually an interesting one for drug prices because, historically, Medicare has not been a big coverer and still isn't of a lot of the drugs that you hear about. So Medicare does not pay by itself for outpatient drugs, drugs that you might take at home. SALMAN KHAN: Really? I always assumed that-- they don't. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: So Medicare, in its main pieces-- Medicare, we call Part A, Part B, Part C-- so Part A and Part B, let's start there. They tend not to cover, or they don't cover, outpatient drugs. If you get a drug in the hospital while you're hospitalized, Medicare will pay for those. And so if you've got a drug that's going to be primarily used in that setting, you're going to talk to Medicare about it, and that's going to be an important piece of the conversation. But if you're talking about an outpatient drug, you're talking to many [INAUDIBLE]. SALMAN KHAN: Now, when we're saying outpatient, inpatient is you're in the hospital. You're sick. You need, I don't know, morphine right now. That's inpatient drug. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. SALMAN KHAN: Outpatient is, hey, you're going back home. Take this three times a day. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. Somebody sends you to the pharmacy to pick up the prescription, and you take it home with you. That's going to be an outpatient kind of drug. So Medicare doesn't cover that in its main Part A and Part B. There's Medicare Part D, which is a drug plan in Medicare, and that will cover a lot of the outpatient drugs. And so there you'd have conversations with them. But most of the Medicare Part D plans are essentially private companies that Medicare contracts with. So you're not really talking to the government at that point. You're talking to these private plans that have contracted with Medicare to provide Part D care. SALMAN KHAN: So once again going back to the crux of the question of how are these drugs going to get paid for, how are we going to determine the price at which these drugs get paid for, it goes straight back to the private plans again because they're going to contract. Part D is going to say, oh, you're Medicare Part D. We're going to go to go to Aetna. We're going to go to some other plan or whoever it might be. I don't know who it might be. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Whoever is offering those Part D plans. SALMAN KHAN: Whoever is offering those Part D plans-- and so it will ride off of whatever that private party has already negotiated with the pharma company. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: It would be related, probably, to that. SALMAN KHAN: OK. So let's say that we have some type of insurance. I'm running out of letters now. Let's call this insurance company Y right over here. And I go have a conversation with insurance company Y, and I'm like, hey, this is a big deal. Disease x, you know it's been killing people. I want $1 million per pill. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, and so those have been really interesting conversations in the US. So there's some bargaining back and forth between the insurance company and the drugmaker. The drugmaker is going to have spent a lot of money. You've got $100 million up there. SALMAN KHAN: Yes. I deserve to make at least $10 billion off-- I'm only kidding. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: So there's a certain amount, to a certain extent [INAUDIBLE]. SALMAN KHAN: It's called anchoring in a negotiation. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Right. You start with what you think you can get. SALMAN KHAN: Yes. Absolutely, yeah. [? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Push ?] that number to get everybody's mind around, yeah. So in reality, it costs well over $100 million to take a drug through the trials, to do the development work. So they're going to be sitting there with a number, at least internally, saying, we want to get our $800 million, our $1.5 billion back from this. And so we're going to try and price it accordingly. SALMAN KHAN: Because it's not just the cost of that one drug-- so what is the cost? Do you know that off the top of your head, the average drug? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: It's hundreds of millions. So there's the development costs that go in that the pharma companies aren't typically willing to talk a lot about. And then there's the cost of getting through the trials and the FDA approvals, which people say $500 million and up. They'll say higher numbers sometimes. SALMAN KHAN: For one given drug? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. SALMAN KHAN: $500 million. So it can be as high as $500 million. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: It can be higher. SALMAN KHAN: Can be greater than $500 million. And so that doesn't even take into the probability-weighted risk, that there's a 10% chance that it fails or a 10% chance that it works. So it's really, if you're spending $100 million per drug and only 1 out of 10 of those drugs are going to get to the end zone-- PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. You'll see along the way. You won't spend a whole wad and then find out. You'll find out in steps. So you'll have to spend something to get there. SALMAN KHAN: I see. You'll stop. So even though on one drug, it might be $100 million or $500 million, they might have spent another $300 million or $400 million on drugs that didn't go anywhere. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Plus their own development costs in the background. SALMAN KHAN: Plus their own development costs. So if you try to fully load the cost, it's a large number. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: It's large, yeah. Right. Exactly. They're running an operation where they've got to put in a lot of money in up front. When they get a success, they have to get enough out of that one success to pay for the operation, to keep things going for the next development round. So they're looking at those kinds of numbers, and they're trying to figure out in this negotiation what they can sell this for. And that's a back and forth discussion. The insurance companies have some ability to say what they're willing to pay, but a lot of these drugs, if they're doing the curing a disease that people care about, the pharma companies have a lot of ability to come and say, this is what we need to get for this and set that price and be able to get it for a while. SALMAN KHAN: So obviously, the pharma company is coming here with all of this investment. They definitely want it to get covered. But the insurance company, their incentive is they don't want to look like, all of the sudden, this company that doesn't provide the cure for disease x. Do insurance companies ever walk away and say, well, that's just too much. I understand you invested all of this money, but we just can't do that. That's just crazy. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: So it's a little bit of a mixed bag. The US doesn't have a lot of cases where insurance companies have really put their foot down and said, no, they're not going to do anything. They're not going to have anything to do with some new drug that comes out. And some of that's due to the existence of lots of different companies. So if five of the companies say no but the next guy in line says yes, then the dynamic of that in a competitive market is often that everybody else will eventually come around and say, OK, we're going to [INAUDIBLE]. SALMAN KHAN: Someone is going to do something. They might not pay for it outright. The whole reason why we're having this conversation is because there are some drugs that seem reasonably priced to me, but there are some that are like $30,000 a pill or something. I made up that number. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. So the cases, the really expensive ones, are drugs that are unique-- tend to be unique, at least to some extent-- cure disease that gets some high profile, so people are worried that they're going to die if they don't get this drug. And of course, they're still on patent. That's another feature of all this, where you get the high price for a certain period of time until your patents run out. SALMAN KHAN: And then the generic-- PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: And then generic comes in and the price-- SALMAN KHAN: Can make them for the cost of the pill, which is-- PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: It drops dramatically. SALMAN KHAN: Pennies or dollars. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: So how you get these things set in a competitive market is an interesting question. One of things that gets the brand name drugs to be a little cheaper is competition within the class. So if there is two or three drug manufacturers who have something that will basically do the same thing, that will tend to take the edge off the $30,000 a pill kind of situation and get you down to more reasonable prices. It won't get you all the way to generic pricing, but [INAUDIBLE]. SALMAN KHAN: It just seems to me-- you just mentioned that very few insurance companies have ever walked away from this. If you ever have a negotiation-- buying a used car-- where one of the two parties is not walking away, then it doesn't seem like there's actually a hard, serious negotiation. Am I getting that wrong? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, I don't know all the ins and outs of all these negotiations. There's lots that goes on in these things. But I think that one of the things that people would say about the US is that when a drug manufacturer comes up with fairly unique, on-patent drug that does some tangible good, that they more or less can set the price that they want to get for it. And they're going to make some calculation, because they could set a high enough price that everybody would say forget it. So they're going to try and figure out something. But they're trying to get as much as they can, and they get some leeway for at least a period of time to name that price. SALMAN KHAN: So they'll get leeway, and I guess there's some range of reasonableness where it's like, OK. Yes, you've done something amazing for humanity. You're going to get a 35% return on your investment, 1but that shouldn't be a 300% return on your investment. 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. 1I don't know at what point the US would ever walk 1or the private insurers will ever walk from this. 1I haven't seen it really happen, and I 1think drug companies are pretty sophisticated about trying 1to figure out what price they think 1they can make work and get that as high as they can get that. 1SALMAN KHAN: So I guess I'm still 1unclear to see who's making out here really well. 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: This has 1been a really interesting debate. 1Pharma companies put huge amounts of money 1into these drugs. 1And once in a while, they do some really useful things, 1and they get high premiums. 1There are other people who argue that some 1of the things that they're getting high premiums for 1aren't really valuable enough or somehow we've 1been told we need a drug that, if we had it 1to our own devices, we would never have come up 1with the fact that we need it. 1And so what's the real value at the end of the day? 1And I think that's one of the debates we're 1going to have in this country for a little while. 1The industry has been coming up with new things, 1and they're going to keep trying to do that. 1We want to, from a social standpoint, from a policy 1standpoint, try to make sure that things we're doing 1are really valuable to society and not copies of other drugs 1or not inventing a disease that didn't need a solution 1and then solving the problem. 1And sometimes we worry that maybe we're 1getting some of that. 1And I think that's the challenge for the US health insurance 1system, for the regulatory processes 1to try to guide the innovation and guide 1the purchasing of these things to really create 1the most value for society. 1It's been a challenge. 1It's going to be a challenge. 1We have the challenge, because we have tremendous opportunity 1with new drugs created. 1SALMAN KHAN: So your gut sense is there probably 1are some drugs out there that they're doing really well, 1well above and beyond the investment cost, 1but it's hard to say. 1It's really on a case by case basis. 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, I 1don't think you'd want to make a generic statement about all 1the drugs that have been discovered. 1Some of the things that we've put out there 1in the last couple of decades are really 1important drugs that are going to do a lot of good. 1And I think there are debates about some other ones where 1maybe somebody's been able to be clever about marketing 1and sell it, and we're less sure that it's [INAUDIBLE]. 1SALMAN KHAN: And that, actually, marketing-- I 1don't want to make this conversation too long-- 1but some people bring up that the drug companies, they say, 1look, there's a lot of investment right 1over here on this. 1And so they have to get some reasonable return on it, 1and that seems to make sense, especially when you probability 1weight it and all of that. 1But they spend a significant amount of marketing 1as well, on actual marketing. 1You watch the nightly news, most of the ads, 1you're going to see a drug company. 1They do the physician dinners, and they do all of their things 1like that. 1That seems to undermine that argument that all of the money 1is going for R&D. 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Right. 1If you just totalled up the dollars, 1I'm not sure what the numbers would come out like, 1and honestly, the pharma companies 1aren't really excited about telling everybody 1all of the details of their businesses for good reason. 1So absolutely, there's a huge amount 1of marketing [INAUDIBLE]. 1SALMAN KHAN: You spend a ton of money on the marketing. 1And then you get the consumer here 1to put the pressure on the insurance 1companies and the doctors to say, hey, you better cover 1that, or I'm asking for that. 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. 1There was a time within my memory 1where we weren't allowed to do direct to consumer 1marketing, where the laws prohibited that. 1And the change came around, and now we're allowed to do it. 1And it's really changed the way that drugs are marketed. 1SALMAN KHAN: And I have found that weird 1because, if these are drugs that are meant 1to be by prescription, which means that it should be 1a doctor's judgment on whether or not 1you should get the drugs, why is it being advertised 1on the nightly news to a general audience? 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Right-- a general 1audience who doesn't understand all the ins and outs 1of the drug and whose doctor may or may not 1want to take the time to explain it all to them. 1SALMAN KHAN: Exactly. 1But then they'll go to the doctor and say, please 1give me this drug. 1And then the doctor, it's easier for them to say, well, sure. 1Why not? 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. 1No, I think a lot of doctors would 1express a certain amount of frustration about that. 1Their patients come in. 1It's hard to have the conversation in a short period 1of time, so it's easier just to give them the drug. 1SALMAN KHAN: Fascinating.",science_health-and-medicine_health-care-system
"  In this video, we're going to see if we can graph a rational function. A rational function is just a function that has an expression on the numerator and the denominator. It has a polynomial in the numerator-- Let's see, we have x squared over-- and another polynomial in the denominator --x squared minus 16. We could obviously graph this by just trying out a bunch of points and then connecting the dots. That's what a calculator would do for us, a graphing calculator. But what we want to do is, before we try out some points to kind of fill in the gaps, I want to understand the basic structure of this graph first. And to understand that, I want to see what happens as x gets really big, so x gets really big, or x gets really, really small, as x goes in the negative direction. Or another way we could think about it, I want to understand what happens as the magnitude of x, or the absolute value of x, becomes really big as it approaches really, really bigness, or as it approaches infinity. So when the size of x approaches infinity. Which essentially is saying, as x goes really far in the positive direction, or x goes really far in the negative direction, what is going to happen to the value of this function? So let's get out a calculator. Won't use the graphing part of it just yet, but let's just try out some values. What happens when x is equal to 10? It's going to be the same thing as when x is equal to negative 10, because when you put a negative 10 here, you square it, you get 100, just like 10. Same here, negative 10, you square it, you get the same thing as a positive 10. So whether you go in the super high positive direction or the super low negative direction, as you approach positive or negative infinity, you're going to approach the same thing because you're squaring the values. But let's try out some values. If I get 10 squared divided by 10 squared minus 16, I get 1.19. Now what happens if x gets a little bit bigger? This is x is equal to 10. What happens when x is equal to 100? We have 100 squared divided by 100 squared minus 16. I'm getting even closer to 1. When x was 10, around here, we're getting y is 1.19. When x is 100, 100 squared over 100 squared minus 16, y is 1.0016. Just for fun, let's try 1,000. So it's 1,000 squared divided by 1,000 squared minus 16. And we're even closer to 1. So as the size of x gets larger and larger and larger, our y gets closer and closer to 1. And that would also be true if this was a negative 10, because negative 10 squared over negative 10 squared minus 16 is going to be the exact same thing. Because the negative, when you square it, is going to be a positive. It's going to be the same thing as 10 squared, same thing over here. So whether x gets really big or x gets really small, we're going to be approaching y is equal to 1. You could try it with a million if you want, and you're going to get a number even closer to 1. So as the size of x approaches infinity, the absolute value of x, or the distance from the origin, approaches infinity, y is approaching 1. Or another way to think about it is, the graph of this function is going to approach the line y is equal to 1. So let me graph the line y is equal to 1. So I'll do it in a dotted line because this isn't the graph of our function, but this is a line that our function is approaching. So that is the graph of y is equal to 1. Now, this idea of a function, or the graph of a function, approaching a line but never quite touching it. So this is going to get closer and closer and closer to this line, y equal to one, in that direction, but never quite getting close enough to it. It'll approach 0, its distance from this y equals 1, but it'll never quite get there. This line that the graph is approaching is called an asymptote.  And it'll be even more clear once I actually graph the function. We're going to work up there. And since it's a horizontal line, we call this a horizontal asymptote.  This is what our graph approaches as we go in the positive direction, or really far in the negative direction. Let's think about some of the other interesting things about this, about this function right here. Well one thing that might pop out at you is this is a difference of squares. This is x squared minus 4 squared. So we can rewrite this as x squared over x plus 4 times x minus 4. So what's going to happen here, as x approaches either positive 4, or x approaches negative 4? Well, first of all, try those values out. If x is equal to 4, what is going to happen? This expression right here, this term right here, is going to be equal to 0. And we're going to be dividing by 0. We cannot do that. Similarly, if x is equal to negative 4, we'd be dividing by 0. This expression, right here, is going to be equal to 0. We can't do that. We could say that this function is undefined at x is equal to plus or minus 4. It can't equal those values because we'd be dividing by 0 in either one of those circumstances. Now, what happens as we approach those values? What happens as x approaches negative 4? Let's just do that one for fun. What happens as x approaches negative 4? Let's say we're approaching it from the negative direction.  So let's try it out in our calculator.  So let's say we want to go from the negative direction. So let's start with negative 4.1. So if we have negative 4.1 squared divided by negative 4.1 squared minus 16, what do we get? We get 20.75. So we get this number, whatever. Let's see if we get even closer to negative 4. So let me just get that entry there. So let's get a little bit closer to negative 4. So instead of negative 4.1, let's do negative 4.01. So let me insert a negative 4.01. And then over here, this is negative 4.01, and see what it is. Now we went to 200, so we're getting to larger and larger values. Let's try negative 4.001. Let's try that out.  Whoops, that's not what I wanted to do. I wanted to do that. So let's try. No that's not what I want to do. Let's see. So we want to go to, instead of 4.01, I want to do 4.001, and over there, negative 4.001. And what do we get? We get 2,000. So as we get closer and closer to negative 4 from the negative direction, we're approaching larger and larger, super larger numbers. And you can try it, if it's 4.0000001, it's going to get to smaller and smaller numbers-- or sorry, larger and larger numbers here. If you do 4.001, it's probably going to be 20,000. And then if you add another 0 here. So as we get closer and closer, it's getting to larger and larger numbers. So we could say, as x approaches negative 4, we could say y is approaching infinity. It's getting to a larger and larger and larger value. But we can't ever quite get to x is equal to 4. It's undefined there. That will make the denominator here equal to 0. So what we want to do here is, we can never quite equal x equal negative 4. So let me see, x is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4. We can never quite get to x is equal to negative 4. Let me draw x is equal to negative 4 as a dotted line, right there. That is x is equal to negative 4.  We can never quite get there, but as we approached it from the negative side, as we had 4.1, then 4.01, we went to larger and larger values. And we also know that as we went on the left-hand side, as we go to larger and larger x values, that y will get closer and closer to 1. So you have a general sense of what this part of the graph will look like. This part of the graph is going to look something like that. As x gets to super negative numbers, it gets closer and closer to 1, as x gets closer and closer to negative 4 from the negative direction, it's going to go closer and closer to infinity. You're going to get closer and closer to a very-- It's going to get larger and larger, I guess, is an easy way to say it. Now, just like x equal negative 4, x equals 4 will also be a point where the graph is undefined. So let me graph that here. 1, 2, 3, 4. Right here.  Right over here. x is equal to 4. And, once again, what happens as we approach x equals 4, let's say from the positive direction? So as x approaches 4 from the positive direction, what's 1going to happen? 1So this is like trying out x is equal to 4.01, or x is 1equal to 4.001, or x is equal to 4.0001. 1So we're just getting closer and closer and closer to x is 1equal to 4. 1Well, these values are the exact same values that we just 1tried on our calculator, except they are the negative 1version of them, right? 1And we already saw that, just the way that this function is 1set up, the negative numbers, they get squared, so whether 1you take the negative or the positive x values, it's going 1to be the same thing. 1This graph is symmetric. 1When x is equal to negative 5, it's the same thing 1as x is equal 5. 1When x is equal to negative 10, it's the same 1thing as x equals 10. 1So the same thing is going to happen. 1You could try it out with your calculator, if you like. 1If you try out these values, you're going to see, as we get 1closer and closer to 4, we're going to approach larger and 1larger numbers. 1These same numbers over here. 1So the graph over here, as we get closer and closer to 4, 1we're going to approach larger and larger numbers. 1And then here, as x gets larger and larger and larger, 1we saw over here, we had these horizontal asymptotes, y gets 1closer and closer to 1. 1So just like we called this a horizontal asymptote, these 1values-- or you can even view these vertical lines: x is 1equal to negative 4 and x is equal to 4 --we call these 1vertical asymptotes. 1 1These are lines, asymptotes, once again, they are lines 1that the graph approaches, but never quite touches. 1So that's what's going on here. 1And then we can think about what's happening to the graph 1inside of here. 1So you could think of it in a couple of ways. 1You could say, well, what happens as x approaches 4 from 1the negative direction? 1So let's try that out, from the negative direction. 1So what happens if you do 3.9 squared divided by 3.9 1squared minus 16? 1You get negative 19.25. 1Now what happens if we do 3.99? 1So let me put another 9 here. 1So we're going to get closer and closer to 4, and we're 1going to do it from the left-hand side 1as we approach 4. 1So insert another 9 here. 1So even more negative. 1So let's just do one more. 1So we're going to be even more negative. 1So let me make it 3.999. 1Get even closer to 4. 1 1You're getting even more negative. 1And this is also going to be true if we did negative 3.9, 1or negative 3.99, or negative 3.999, because when we square 1it, the negatives and the positives are the same thing. 1You square negative 1, you get a positive 1. 1So as we approach 4 from-- you go 3.9, 3.99, we get closer 1and closer to 4 --we're getting more and 1more negative numbers. 1We approach negative infinity. 1So as we approach-- let me just graph it here. 1As we approach from this direction, we're going to get 1smaller-- want to not touch our asymptote --it's going to 1look something like that. 1As we approach it from the left-hand side, we're getting 1smaller and smaller numbers. 1And that's also going to be true as we approach negative 4 1from the right-hand side, right? 1As we get negative 3.9, 3.99, 3.999, we're 1going to drop down. 1It's going to look something like that. 1And now that we have a general sense of what the graph is, 1now is a good time where we could maybe plot 1a few points here. 1And the easiest one is, what happens when x is equal to 0? 1You have 0 squared over 0 squared minus 16. 1So the point when x is equal to 0, we're going to have 0 1over, well, negative 16, which is just 0. 1So the point 0, 0 is on this curve. 1And then we could try some other points if you like, but 1the general shape here is going to look 1something like this. 1 1You could plot more points if you really want to nail down 1exactly what the curve is doing in between, but here is 1the general structure. 1And we tried out a lot of values with the calculator. 1And I did that because I really wanted to show you why 1it's dropping down like this. 1And if you think about it, it makes complete sense. 1As you get closer and closer, let's say you get closer and 1closer to 4. 1Either way, as you get closer and closer to 4, this is going 1to become a smaller and smaller and smaller number, 1because this is the difference between x and 4. 1So this is becoming a smaller and 1smaller and smaller number. 1Then, when you take 1 over that, right? 1You can essentially view this as x squared over x plus 4, or 1times 1 over x minus 4. 1If this is becoming smaller and smaller, this whole thing, 11 over a super small number, is a super large number. 1So as you can imagine, you're going to get larger and 1larger, and depending on whether you are approaching 1from the positive or negative, so whether this is a super 1small negative number or super small positive number, that's 1going to flip the sign. 1But either way, the magnitude-- So we're getting 1to a very large magnitude in the negative direction because 1the difference between x and 4 on this side 1is negative, right? 13.9 minus 4 is 0.1. 1Take the inverse of that, it's 10. 1So we're getting negative numbers here. 1You take the inverse, you're going to get super large 1negative numbers. 1So I really want to give you that intuition. 1But the general way of being able to graph these type of 1things, your first thing you want to do is identify the 1horizontal asymptotes. 1What happens as we get very-- the magnitude of our x is very 1large, so super positive values or 1super negative values. 1You could try it out on a calculator, if you like. 1You literally, if you try out the value of a million or a 1billion, it will kind of give you the answer. 1But the way you could also think about it is, as x gets 1really large, you could view that this thing, these terms 1right here grow so much faster-- I mean this is just a 1constant term. 1This term doesn't matter anymore. 1If this is a million and a million, who 1cares about the 16? 1So as x gets really large, you could say that y is 1approximately x squared over x squared. 1These two terms dominate. 1You don't need to worry about the 16 anymore. 1And of course, this is equal to 1, which is exactly what we 1got when we plugged in really large numbers. 1So, in a problem like this, where you have the same 1coefficient, or where you have the same degree on the 1numerator and the denominator, you look at the coefficient of 1those terms. So in this case, the coefficient is 1 and 1. 1So our horizontal asymptote is going to be 1 divided by 1, or 1y is equal to 1. 1If this was 2x squared over x squared minus 16, our 1horizontal asymptote would be y is equal to 2. 1We would approach that line, up there. 1If it was a negative 2, our horizontal asymptote would be 1y is equal to negative 2. 1So that's how you identify the horizontal asymptotes where 1you have the same degree in the numerator and the 1denominator. 1If the denominator has a larger degree, then the 1denominator is going to get larger much faster than the 1numerator, and your asymptote is going to be 0. 1I'll show an example of that in the future. 1And obviously, if your numerator has a higher degree 1than your denominator, it's going to grow way faster than 1your denominator, and you won't have any asymptote. 1You'll just keep growing, or keep going in 1the negative direction. 1And that's actually the case with all of the polynomials 1we've seen. 1You can do them all as being over 1. 1In which case, there was no horizontal asymptote. 1Now the vertical asymptotes you identify by essentially 1just factoring the denominator and figuring out where 1does it equal 0. 1Those are the points where the function is not defined. 1And I'll show you in the future, there are some special 1cases where they won't be vertical asymptotes, and I 1guess that special case is, for example, if you had-- 1Well, I won't show you the special case right now. 1I'll show you that in a future video. 1But in general, if you factor the bottom terms and they 1don't cancel out with anything on the numerator, then you're 1going to be dealing with a vertical asymptote. 1If I had another x minus 4 up here, if my numerator was x 1squared times x minus 4, and then these canceled out, and 1my expression simplified to this, the equation would still 1be undefined at x is equal to 4, because you would give the 10 in the denominator. 1But since that x minus 4 cancels out with the x minus 4 1in the numerator, it would not have 1been a vertical asymptote. 1We'll look at that in the future. 1But this equation wasn't that. 1So the general rule of thumb for identifying the vertical 1asymptotes, factor the denominator, figure out where 1the denominator equals 0, and if those terms don't cancel 1out with any terms of the numerator, then those are 1vertical asymptotes. 1And then to figure out the behavior, I guess, within the 1asymptotes, you can plot some points. 1You can try out some points. 1You can actually substitute values for x and 1figure out what y is. 1Now just to validate that we hopefully got the right 1answer, let's actually graph our rational function. 1So let me turn it on. 1Let me graph it. 1And we say y is equal to x squared divided by x 1squared minus 16. 1And let's see what we get. 1Nope, I just want to graph it. 1My range is off. 1Let me do my range. 1Let me see, x minimum value I want for x, let's say it's 1negative 10. 1My maximum value I want for x is 10. 1x scale is 1. y minimum value, I want negative 10. 2y maximum value, I want 10. 2Then y scale, I want 1. 2Now let me graph it. 2There we go. 2Look at that. 2Just like what we drew. 2We have an asymptote, as x gets really large, or x gets 2really, really small, that asymptote is y is equal to 1. 2We have our vertical asymptote. 2It graphed it because it tried to connect the dots, but it 2essentially graphed our asymptotes for us, but that 2wouldn't actually be part of the graph. 2But as we approach 4 from 0, I guess we can 2say, we go super negative. 2As we approach negative 4 from 0, we get super negative. 2Because in either of those situations, as you approach 4 2from this side, this term is going to be negative. 2As you approach negative 4 from thid side, this term, 2right here, is going to be-- Well, this term right here is 2going to be positive, but then this term right here is going 2to be negative. 2Negative times a positive, you could play 2with it as you like. 2But we approach negative infinity in either case. 2And then as x approaches infinity, this thing 2asymptotes away. 2So hopefully you found that fun. 2",math_algebra2_rational
" -  We're told the polynomial p of x, which is equal to this, has a known factor of x plus six. Rewrite p of x as a product of linear factors. Pause this video, and see if you can have a go at that. All right, now let's work on this together. Because they give us one of the factors, what we can do is say hey, what happens if I divide x plus six into p of x? What do I have left over? It looks like I'm still going to have a quadratic, and then I'll probably have to factor that somehow to get a product of linear factors. So let's get going. So if I were to try to figure out what x plus six divided into, x to the third plus nine x squared, and now we're gonna have to be careful. You might be tempted to just write minus 108 there, but then this gets tricky because you have your third degree column, your second degree column. You need your first degree column, but you just put your zero degree, your constant column here. So to make sure we have good hygiene, we could write plus zero x, and I encourage you to actually always do this if you're writing out a polynomial so that you don't skip that place, so to speak, minus 108. And so then you say, all right, let's look at the highest degree terms. X goes into x to the third x squared times. X squared times six is six x squared. X squared times x is x to the third. We want to subtract. We've done this multiple times, so I'm going a little bit faster than normal. Those cancel out. Nine x squared minus six x squared is three x squared. Bring down that zero x. And then how many times does x go into three x squared? Well, it goes three x times, and we would write it in this column. And notice, if we didn't keep this column for our first degree terms, we'd be kind of confused where to write that three x right about now. And so three x plus, times six, I should say, is 18 x. Three x times x is three x squared. We want to subtract what we have in that, I guess that color is mauve, light purple, not sure. And so we get three x squareds cancel out, and then zero x minus 18 x is negative 18 x. Bring down that negative 108. And so then we have x goes into negative 18 x negative 18 times. Negative 18 times six is negative 108. That's working out nicely. Negative 18 times x is negative 18 x. And then we want to subtract what we have in this not-so-pleasant brown color, and so I will multiply them both by a negative. And so I am left with zero. Everything just cancels out. And so I can rewrite p of x. I can rewrite p of x as being equal to x plus six times x squared plus three x minus 18. But I'm not done yet because this is not a linear factor. This is still quadratic. So let's see, can I think of two numbers that add up to three and that when I multiply I get negative 18? So I'll need different signs, and then the obvious one is positive six and negative three. And if that, what I just did, seems like voodoo to you, I encourage you to review factoring polynomials. But this I can rewrite 'cause negative six plus, or actually I should say positive six plus negative three is equal to three, and then positive six times negative three is equal to negative 18. So I can rewrite this as x plus six times x plus six times x minus three. And so there we have it. We have a product of linear factors. And we are done.",math_math3_poly-div
" - When you think about what the field of economics is about, it is quite daunting. An economy is made up of millions or even billions of actors organized in incredibly complex ways. Write down, this is complex real-world and each of the actors, human beings or organizations, these are incredibly complex. A human brain. I can't predict what you're going to do the next second much less what you're going to do the next day or the next year and imagine trying to make insights about what millions or billions of people will do but the field of economics has borrowed an idea from other fields. So for example, in chemistry, chemists have tried to understand at a high level, well, how do molecules in a container behave? Let's say molecules of gas. Well, you could imagine if you have a container here with trillions upon trillions of molecules, this is incredibly complex but by making some simplifying assumptions about the type of interactions these particles will have or don't have, they can come up with models like the ideal gas law which you might be familiar with or not from your chemistry class that relates the pressure to the volume to the number of particles you have to the actual temperature and so this right over here where you're taking something that's hairy and complex and making simplifying assumptions to help you understand it, this thing right over here is a model and this is in other fields as well. Sometimes, it's not an equation. Sometimes, it might be a simpler organism. For example, in biology, human beings are incredibly complex organisms and not only are they incredibly complex but certain forms of experimentation would also feel fairly unethical to our modern moral ethos and so what do biologists do? Well, they make simplifying assumptions or they pare down, they say, okay, we can't do that study on human beings but maybe we can simplify the problem by looking at simpler organisms. Maybe you can look at an individual cell right over here. Maybe you can look at things like fruit flies which are famous in the study of genetics. Maybe you can even look at fairly complex organisms. Even a mouse is a very complex thing but it's still simpler than a human being and at least to our modern ethics, we're willing to do certain things to mice that we aren't willing to do to human beings and so that's why in a biological context, you will hear people talk about things like a mouse model where they will test a drug on a mouse or try to understand how something happens in a mouse and then say, well, that's a pretty good indication that might be happening to human beings. In fact, when they do drug trials in medicine, they often will do it on mice first and when they have good confidence that it works there and that it's fairly safe, only then will they start to do the experiments on human beings. Well, economists are doing the same thing. Even before the advent of computers and computer models, economists make simplifying assumptions, assumptions like all of the actors in an economy are rational which we already know is not exactly true. I'm not always rational and I definitely know people who aren't always rational. They're simplifying assumptions that all of the people in an economy have the same access to information or that they all even have perfect information which we also know isn't necessarily true in a real economy. So depending on the model, there are going to be these simplifying assumptions that take this large, complex real-world thing and try to break it down into simple equations or lines or charts. We have models early on in our economic study. We will see things like the production possibility frontier where it assumes that you're only trading off between two things and everything else is equal, this notion of ceteris, ceteris paribus which means all things equal. In a real-world, you're not gonna be able to say, hey, let's just pick between these two things and then hold everything else equal. There's hundreds or thousands or millions of variables are operating but if you wanna make a model, maybe we can make these assumptions. Same thing with famous price equilibria that we're going to study later on where you have supply and demand and then you have these notions of equilibrium prices and quantities. These also make similar types of assumptions about rational actors and perfect information and these economic models can be very useful and that's why most of your study in a first year economics course is of these models. Now, with that said, you should also take them with a grain of salt and you shouldn't just accept them as the absolute description of reality. In fact, that's when economic models can get dangerous. You always have to be conscientious of what are those assumptions you made? In fact, Nobel Prizes have been won in economics by revisiting some simplifying assumptions and coming up with new models. The other difficulty about economics is it's hard to test it in as absolute a way definitely as something like chemistry or physics but even in biology where you're dealing with similarly complex systems, a human body and an economy, these are both extremely complex systems. If I wanna see in medicine whether a certain medication works, I can do a clinical trial. I could take hundreds or thousands of people and give maybe half of them the drug and I could try to control for a bunch of different variables but in economics, you can't take a thousand different economies that look very similar in what you think matters and then apply some type of economic prescription to half of them and then see what happens, to see whether your model is exactly true or whether your prescription for what makes an economy grow faster actually works and so the big takeaway, models are valuable across the various sciences including in economics but economics straddles between a social science and the sciences like chemistry or physics because you can't run experiments in the same way and we often make simplifying assumptions that even though we know aren't exactly true, they're the only way that we're able to make sense of an incredibly complex real-world.",economics-finance-domain_macroeconomics_macro-basic-economics-concepts
" - We're to let a and b be rational numbers, and let b be non-zero, they have to say let b be non-zero because we're about to divide by b. Is a over b rational or irrational? Well let's think about it, they're both rational numbers so that means that a, since it's rational, can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, so I can write a is equal to m over n, and same thing about b, I could write b as being equal to p over q, where where m, n, p, and q are integers, are integers, by definition of what a rational number is, they're telling us these numbers are rational so I can express them as these types of ratios. So what is a over b going to be? a over b is going to be m over n over p over q which is equal to m over n, if I divide by a fraction, it's the same thing as multiplying by the reciprocal. q over p, let me write that a little bit, q over p which is equal to mq over np. Well mq is going to be an integer, if the product of two integers is going to be an integer, and np is going to be another integer, the product of two integers is an integer, so I've just shown that a over b can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, so a over b is for sure, in fact I've just proven it to you, a over b is for sure going to be rational. Let's do a few more of these, this is interesting. All right, so now we're saying let a and b be irrational numbers. Is a over b, let a and b be irrational numbers. Is a over b rational or irrational? And, like always, pause the video and try to think this through, and you might want do some examples of some irrational numbers and see if you can get, when you divide them, you can get rational or irrational numbers. Well, let's just imagine a world where, let's say, that a is equal to, I dunno, two square roots of two, and b is equal to the square root of two. Well, in that world, a over b, a over b would be two square roots of two over the square root of two which would be two, which is very much a rational number, I can express that as a ratio of integers, I can write that as two over one, there's actually an infinite number of ways I can express that as a ratio of two integers. So, in this case, I was able to get a over b to be rational, based on a and b being irrational. But, what if, what if instead of, what if a was equal to the square root of two and b is equal to the square root of, let's say, b is equal to the square root of seven. Well, then a over b would be equal to the square root of two over the square root of seven, which is still going to be irrational, I mean another way to think about it, and I'm not proving it here, but you could think about it, this is going to be the square root of two sevens, so we have something that's not a perfect square under the radical, so we're going to end up with an irrational number. So, we can show one example where a over b is rational and we showed one example where it is irrational, so it can be either way. Let's do a few more of these. All right, let a be a non-zero rational number. Is a times the square root of eight rational or irrational? Well, the key here is, if you multiply an irrational number and why is this an irrational number? It has a perfect square in it, but it's not a perfect square in and of itself. The square root of eight is, the square root of eight is equal to the square root of four times two, which is equal to the square root of four times the square root of two, which is equal to two square roots of two. And, this is kind of getting to the punchline of this problem, but if I multiply a rational times an irrational, I am going to get an irrational. So the square root of eight is an irrational, and if I multiply that times a rational number, I'm still going to get an irrational number. So this is going to be, for sure, irrational. Let's do one more of these. So we're to let a be an irrational number. Is negative 24 plus a rational or irrational? And I won't give a formal proof here, but to give you more of an intuitive feel, it's nice to just try out some numbers, and I encourage you to pause the video and try to think through it yourself. Let's just imagine some values, imagine if a is irrational, a is irrational, so what if a was equal to negative pi, which is approximately equal to negative three point one four one five nine and it keeps going on and on forever, never repeating. Well, then we would have negative 24 plus a would be equal to negative 24 minus pi, which would be approximately negative 27 point one for one five nine, the decimal expansion, everything to the right of the decimal, is going to be the exact same thing as pi. So this looks like, at least for this example, is going to be irrational, and let's see, if a was square root of two negative 24 plus the square root of two, well, once again, I'm not doing a proof here, but intuitively, this is going to be a decimal, it's going to have a decimal expansion that's going to go on forever and never repeat, and so this would just change what's to the left of the decimal, but not really change what's, well it would change what's to the right of the decimal because this is negative, but it's still going to go on forever and never repeat, and if, in fact, this was if this was this way, then to the right of the decimal, you would have the same thing as the square root of two to the left of the decimal, you would just have a different value, you would have negative 25 point whatever whatever whatever, and so this is, when you add a rational number to an irrational number, we've proven in other videos, a rational plus an irrational is going to be irrational, irrational. If you want that proof, we have other videos within this tutorial.",math_in-in-class-9-math-kv_in-in-8-kv-number-systems
" -  So we have blank plus 261 is equal to 630, and I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can figure out what blank is. So there's a couple of ways to tackle this. Let's visualize it on a number line. So that's my number line right over there. And we could start at blank, or I'll call that question mark. So we could start at question mark, and if we add 261 to it, so if we add 261, plus 261, we can get to 630. We can get to 630. That's the 630 right over there, which means that if we started at 630, if we start at 630, and we were to subtract 261, if we were to go the other way, if we were to subtract 261, so let's do that. So, minus 261. Minus 261. We're gonna get back to blank. We're gonna get back to our question mark. Now there's a bunch of ways that you can compute this, but I'm gonna try to tackle it in a way that I would actually try to do it in my head, or it'll simply my computation, it's just one of many ways to figure this out. So the way I would do it is I would first subtract 200, so I would first subtract 200. So that's about, I'm not drawing it perfectly to scale. So I would subtract 200, so that's minus 200 right over there, which would get me to 430. I could do that in my head. I just subtracted two hundreds from that. And let's see, now I wanna subtract 60. So then I would subtract 60. So minus 60. Let's see, 430 minus 60. That's 43 10s minus six 10s. Well, that's gonna be 37 10s, or 370. This gets us to 370. And then we going to subtract one more. We have to subtract 260 and then we subtract one. So 370 minus one is 369. So this right over here is 360, 369. Now, another way we could have done it is we could have swapped the order. We could have said if blank plus 261 is 630, we could have said 261 plus blank is equal to 630. All I did is I swapped the order here, but we could visualize that as a different thing on the number line. So I'm going to, let me draw my number line again. So there's my number line. And I could start at 261. So this time I'm starting at 261. 261. And I wanna get to 630. And I wanna get to 630, and the amount that I add is going to be the blank. So let's see what I have to add to get to 630. And I'm gonna add numbers that are easy for me to compute. So I could add nine, I could add nine. Now, why did I add nine? Because that gets me to 270, which is a nice, round number. And then I could add, let's see, I could 30 here to get to 300, so let me do that. So plus 30. I'm not doing this quite to scale, but this is going to get me to 300. And then from 300 to 630, well I could just add 330. I could just add 330 there. So how much did I add in total? This is 39 plus 330. That's 369. I added 369. So these are all ways of getting to the same value, all ways of viewing the same problem.",math_in-in-class-3rd-math-cbse_imp-addition-and-subtraction
" -  Part b, write the first four, write the first nonzero terms of the Maclaurin series for f prime, the derivative of f. Express f prime as a rational function for the absolute value of x being less than R, our radius of convergence. So, if we wanna find f prime, we could just take each of, we could just take the derivative of each of these terms with respect to x. And so, we could just say, if this is f, then f prime, and I'm not gonna scroll down just so I can see this up here. We could just say f prime, f prime of x is going to be, or the Maclaurin series for f prime of x, maybe I should write it that way, so let me write it this way. Maclaurin, Maclaurin, Maclaurin, that a looked funny, Maclaurin series for f prime, f prime of x, well, it's going to be the sum from n equals one to infinity, and we would just take the derivative of this right over here with respect to x. And so, this is just application of the power rule. Take the exponent right over here, multiply it by the coefficient, so if you take n times this, it cancels out with this n, so it's going to be negative three to the n minus one, and then decrement your exponent, times x to the n minus one. And so, they want us to write the first four nonzero terms of the Maclaurin series, so that is going to be equal to, so, I'll write approximately equal to, because we're one going to write the first four of terms of this infinite series, and just to be clear what I did, I just did the power rule here, I looked at this exponent, which is n, multiplied by this coefficient, which had a n in the denominator, so that n and this n cancel out, so I'm just left with negative three to the n minus one, and then I decrement that exponent. That's straight out of the power rule, it's one of the first things you'll learn about taking derivatives. And so, if we want the first four nonzero terms, when n equals one this is going to be negative three to the one minus one power, let me just write it, negative three to the one minus one times x to the one minus one, that's when n equals one, plus negative three, negative three to the two minus one, two minus one, times x to the two minus one, and then, and actually I could've reassured this is negative three x to the n minus one, actually let me me do that just for, so this is, this I could just write, because they have the same exponent, this will simplify a little bit, as negative three x to the n minus one, and so this going to be approximately, when n is equal to one, this is gonna be equal to zero, so negative three x to the zero power is just gonna be one, when n is equal to two, this is going to be two minus one, so it's gonna be the first power, so negative three x to the first power, so I could just write this as negative three x, and then when n is three, well, this is going to be negative three x squared, so negative three x squared is going to be, negative three squared is nine x squared, and then the fourth term is gonna be negative three x to the four minus one power, so to the third power, so negative three to the third power is negative 27 times x to the third power. So there you have it, that's the first four nonzero terms of the Maclaurin series. You could've also just looked over here, and said okay, the derivative of x, with respect to x is one, derivative of negative three have x squared, with respect to x is negative three, you could've said, the derivative of this is nine x squared, right over there, and then you'd have to write out the fourth term and take out the derivative in the same way, and you'd have gotten this right over here. So we did the first part, we wrote the first four nonzero terms of the Maclaurin series for f prime, the derivative of f, and then they said, express f prime as a rational function for the absolute value of x being less than R. So this sum, if we assume it converges, and we know the radius of convergence already, so, or assuming that we're dealing with x that are withing the radius of convergence. So this right over here, you might recognize this, so I could write it like that, or I could also write it, if I start at n equals zero, so I could also write this as from n equals one to infinity of, or actually, from n equals zero to infinity of negative three x to the n minus one, either, I'm sorry, to the n, because now the first term was to the zero power, that first term was to zero power, so whether you do one minus one, is where you start, or you just at zero, these two things are equivalent. You might recognize these as a geometrix series with common ration of negative, of negative three x. And so, what's the sum of a geometric series with common ration, with a certain common ration? Well, it's going to be equal to the first term, and regardless of how you view this, the first term is going to be one divided by one minus the common ratio. So our common ratio is negative three x, one minus negative three x, well, that's just going to be one plus three x. If what I just did here looks unfamiliar to you, I encourage you to watch the sum of infinite geometric series, and not only do we show you this formula and how to apply it, but we show how you can prove this formula, it's actually a pretty fun prove. But anyway, regardless of how you view this Maclaurin series, it is an infinite geometric series, and this assuming that our x is in our radius of convergence. This is what our sum is, this is what we are going to converge to.",math_calculus-all-old_ap-calc-topic
" I've hopefully given you a bit of a gut feeling behind where the formula of Gibbs Free Energy comes from. In this video I want to do something a little bit more rigorous and actually, I guess you could say derive the formula. So to do that, let's just study two systems that have the exact same change in entropy. To depict that, I'll get out our handy PV diagram. What we're going to do is we're going to compare two systems. One that's this perfect, reversible system and one that's irreversible or a spontaneous system. So they're both going to start here. They're going to go from this point on the PV diagram to this point right here. And before we go into exactly what they're doing, I think it's a good review to kind of talk about what an irreversible process and what a reversible process really is. An irreversible process is this theoretical thing where you have no friction, where you're always so close to equilibrium that you can always go backwards. You're always-- you can kind of view that the reaction is never really proceeding forward or backwards. Although obviously it is moving, so it's a very-- it actually doesn't really exist in nature, but it's a useful theoretical construct. So let me draw a little. So if this is a-- I'll get the good old pistons out. So let's say this is an-- I'll do it twice. So that's my irreversible piston-- That'll be my reversible, this is going to be my irreversible. Let me draw them. OK, and let me label them. So this right here is going to be reversible. And this right here is going to be irreversible. Or it could also be considered spontaneous. Using the key word. That's going to matter for Gibbs Free Energy. But all spontaneous reactions are irreversible. So they're going to go from this state to this state. So in our reversible world, we have this little cap to our piston. And we have our gas in here, exerting some pressure. And what we'd have is a bunch of pebbles. We have a bunch of pebbles out here. And we slowly remove the pebbles one by one. And as we remove the pebbles, our piston-- or this movable ceiling up here-- will move upwards. It'll move upwards. So the pressure will push up, but as we move up, we will have lower and lower pressure because the gases will bounce into the surface less. And we'll have a higher, higher volume. So as we move each infinitesimally small grain of sand, and we're going to do it super slow, that we're always infinitely close to equilibrium. We're going to move from this state to this state. And even better, let's view that this is the first stage of our Carnot cycle. Let's say in either case, we're on top of a reservoir. So in either case, both of these systems are on top of this infinite reservoir that has a temperature T1. And what that does it keeps the temperature constant. So we're going to travel along an isotherm. Because normally if we were to remove these things and if we just allowed it to occur adiabatically, we would actually lose temperature. We would actually lose average kinetic energy as work is done. But in this case we have this reservoir. So heat is just going to be transferred to my system. Heat is going to be transferred. So let me call that QR. Right? If the reservoir wasn't here, our temperature would go down. But since we do have the reservoir, we will constantly be transferring heat. And we've seen this. This is just the first phase of the Carnot cycle. We'll move along an isotherm like this. This is the reversible case. And the only reason why we can even draw the state at every point here is because reversible processes are quasistatic. They're always infinitely close to equilibrium. And when we say reversible, we're also saying there's no friction between this little piston in the cylinder. That if we put a grain of sand back, it'll go exactly to where it was before. And no energy was lost because there was no heat of friction there. So this is what the graph of the reversible process would look like. Now what does the graph of the error irreversible-- Well, actually no. I won't draw the graph, but let's talk about what the irreversible process is going to be like. So it's going to look similar. It's going to look like that. It's going to have its gases there. But for the sake of an argument, to get from that state to that state, instead of moving the pebbles one by one, let's say I have these big blocks. And when I remove one of these big blocks, I go from that state to that state. But obviously all hell breaks loose. So I'm not really defined in this in between state. But I definitely go from that state to that state once I go back to equilibrium. Now the other key thing in the irreversible process-- and every real process in our world is irreversible-- is that you're going to have friction here. As this moves up, it's going to rub against the side of the container and generate heat of friction. So let me call that heat of friction. So let me ask you a question. If, in this case, Q sub R had to be added to the system to maintain its temperature, what's going to be the Q sub irreversible here? How much has to be added to this system in order to keep it at the constant temperature T1? Will it have to be more or less than what was added to the reversible system? Well this guy, as this piston moves up, he's generating some of his own heat. So if this was an adiabatic process, he wouldn't lose as much temperature as this guy would. So he's going to need less heat from the reservoir in order to maintain his temperature. At T1. In order to get to this point on the isotherm. Remember, this irreversible process, we don't know what happens over here. He might be travelling on some crazy path. In fact, we can't even define the path, because it goes out of equilibrium. So it's going to be some crazy thing. But we know it pops back on the PV diagram right there. But because it's generating some of its own heat from the friction, it's going to need less heat from the reservoir. So let me write that down. The heat absorbed by the reversible process is going to be greater than the heat absorbed by the irreversible process. And that's because the irreversible process is generating friction. Fair enough. Now what is the change in entropy for both systems? Well they both started here. And they both ended here. And entropy is a state variable. So the change in entropy for the reversible process is going to be equal to the change in entropy for the irreversible process. They're both going from there to there. And obviously the entropy has changed. We're going from one state to another state. And the entropy, well I won't go too much into it. But let's ask another question. What is the total change in entropy of the universe for the reversible process? So for the universe, that's going to be-- Our universe here is the reservoir in our system. So let me write here. Reversible. I don't want to run out of space. Let me see, I'll do it in a different color. So this is the reversible process. So the change in entropy of the universe is equal to the change in entropy of our reversible process plus the change in entropy of-- oh, I already used R for reversible, so let's call it the reserv-- well, the first three letters are the same, so let me call it of our environment. Right? And then the reversible process, the change in entropy of our reversible process is the heat added for our reversible process. And we can use this definition because it is a reversible process. It's that over T1. And then what's the change in entropy of our environment? Well it's giving away Q sub R. Right? So its heat absorbed is minus Q sub R. And, of course, it's at a constant temperature. It is a heat reservoir. It's at T1. So it equals 0. It equals 0. Interesting. So actually I should take a little side note here. That, the change in entropy of the universe for a reversible process is 0. And actually that should make a lot of intuitive sense because the whole point of a reversal process is you could go in this direction, or you could go in that direction. It's always so close people to equilibrium you can move in either direction. And if the entropy was greater than 0 in one direction, it would have to be less than 0 on the other direction. So it wouldn't be able to go in the other direction by the second law of thermodynamics. So it actually makes sense that the entropy of the universe-- the change in entropy of the universe, not just of the system-- when a reversible process occurs, is 0. Let's see if we can relate that to the irreversible process So if I wanted to figure out the change in entropy of the irreversible process-- What's the change in entropy of the irreversible process? And then let me subtract from that the heat that was taken away from the reservoir, from the irreversible process, Q sub IR, and of course all this over T1. What is this going to be equal to in relation to 0? Remember this is an irreversible, spontaneous process. Well, this value, the irreversible process is starting here and going there. So its change in delta S is the exact same thing as that. Change in delta S is the same as the reversible process. So these two things are equivalent. Now, I just told you that since there's some heat of friction, this guy has to take in less heat from the reservoir than this guy. So if this-- and I wrote it here. I mean, let me clean this thing up a little bit. I wrote it right here. 1Q sub IR, the heat that the irreversible process has to 1take from the reservoir, because generating its own 1heat from friction, is less than the heat from the 1reversal process. 1So this number, right here, is less than this number here. 1Or you could view it this way. 1This number here was equal to this. 1So this number here is going to be less than this. 1So this has to be greater than 0 for the irreversible, 1spontaneous process. 1Now let's just do a little bit of mathematics. 1So this is the heat that was essentially given to the 1irreversible system. 1It's a minus here because this is the term. 1It's kind of taken away from the actual reservoir. 1So let's just do a little bit of-- let's just multiply all 1sides of this equation by T1. 1And we get T1 times delta S of the irreversible process minus 1Q of the irreversible process is greater than 0. 1Now, well, let's just-- So what is this? 1How can we say this? 1But let's actually just multiply both sides of this by 1negative 1. 1And remember, this is true for any 1irreversible, spontaneous process. 1If you multiply both sides of this by 1negative 1, you get this. 1The heat added to the irreversible process minus T 1times delta S of the irreversible process is going 1to be less than 0. 1This is true for any 1irreversible, spontaneous process. 1And at this point, this should look 1reasonably familiar to you. 1When we wrote the Gibbs Free Energy formula, we said change 1in G is equal to delta H minus T times delta S. 1And we said that if this is less than 0, then we have a 1spontaneous process. 1And this all makes sense. 1Because these two are equivalent to each other. 1What's the only difference here? 1Here we wrote heat added to the system. 1Here we wrote change in enthalpy. 1And I've done three or four videos right now, where I say 1that change in enthalpy is equal to the heat added to a 1system, as long as we're dealing with a constant 1pressure system. 1So we get this result just by comparing a irreversible to a 1reversible system. 1And this is true for all 1irreversible, spontaneous processes. 1And then if we assume that we're dealing with a constant 1pressure system-- so you can forget a little bit of what I 1just drew, because we know that this is true, and we 1assume constant pressure-- then we get to this. 1And then we know that if something is spontaneous, then 1this right here must be less than 0. 1So hopefully you found that a little bit interesting. 1Actually I'll do one more point here. 1This kind of gels with the idea that second law of 1thermodynamics tells us that for any spontaneous process, 1delta S is going to be greater than or equal-- or well for 1any spontaneous process, is going to be greater than 0. 1Because although this right here isn't the formal 1definition of entropy, because we're not dealing with a 1reversible process here, you can kind of 1think of it that way. 1And so, at least, on an intuitive level it gets you 1there, that we have delta S greater than 0. 1And I won't fixate on that too much, because what I did 1earlier in the video is more rigorous than what I'm heading 1to right now. 1So hopefully that gives you a sense of where you can get to 1the Gibbs Free Energy formula, and how it drives spontaneous 1reactions from just our basic understanding of what 1reversible and irreversible processes are, and how they 1relate to entropy and heat exchange and enthalpy.",science_ap-chemistry_thermodynamics-ap
" -  So this could very well be an exciting video because we start with this idea of a Fourier series that we could take a periodic function and represent it as an infinite sum of weighted cosines and sines and we use that idea to say, ""Well can we find formulas ""for those coefficients?"" And we were able to do that using the powers of calculus. And now we can actually apply it for this particular square wave. And I picked a square wave that has a period of two pi and that's where, actually, a lot of these two pis came out from, and that's also why we started here at cosine t and sine of t. They both have a frequency of one over two pi, which is the frequency of our original square wave. And then the other terms have frequencies that are multiples of that. If we had a different period then all of that would change. But I picked this period to just make the math a little bit simpler and we will generalize in the future. But now, let's actually evaluate a-sub-zero, a-sub-n, and b-sub-n for this particular square wave. So, they key to realize is that our square wave between zero and pi, 'cause we're gonna keep taking the definite integral from zero to two pi, from zero to two pi, from zero to two pi. The key realization here is from zero to pi our function is equal to three, and from pi to two pi, our function is equal to zero. So all of these definite integrals. So this definite integral, for example, is going to be the same thing as, and I'll do it once and then we'll see that trend. This is the same thing as one over two pi times the definite integral from zero to pi of f-of-t dt plus the integral from pi to two pi of f-of-t dt. Now f-of-t, between zero and pi, we just said it's equal to three. And f-of-t between pi and two pi, well it's going to be equal to zero. And that's actually the case for these other situations. That f-of-t's gonna be zero from pi to two pi and zero times anything is gonna be zero, so the integrals, the definite integrals over this, the second part of the interval, are always going to be zero. And so it boils down to this. And so what's the definite integral from zero to pi of three dt? Well this is going to be equal to one over two pi times, so if you evaluate this, the anti-derivative of three, it'd be three t, evaluated from zero to pi, and so it'd be three pi minus three times zero which is just three pi. So it's equal to three pi over the two pi that we had already, over the two pi, and so this is going to be equal to three halves. Three halves. And that makes a lot of sense because a-sub-zero we said you could view that as the average value of the function over that interval. And the average value of that function is indeed, if it's three half the time, and zero the other half of the time, well then the average is going to be one and a half, or three halves. So that is our a-sub-zero. So now let's figure out the general a-sub-n where n is not equal zero. So, a-sub-n, well we are just gonna take, it's gonna be one over pi, one over pi, the definite integral, I could go from zero to two pi, but instead I'm just gonna cut to the chase. I'm gonna go just from zero to pi 'cause the integral from pi to two pi is just gonna be zero 'cause the function's equal to zero. It's gonna be zero times cosine nt; it's just gonna be zero. So for this particular square wave, I can just worry about from zero to pi. From zero to pi, f-of-t is three. So it's gonna be three cosine-nt. Three, let me do that color, three cosine-of-nt, cosine-nt dt. Now what is this going to be equal to? Well we can do a few things. We could take our three and bring it out front. So let me do that. So we could take that three and bring it out front. So, just putting the three out here. So take that three, put it out front. And we know that the derivative of sine-of-nt is n cosine-of-nt. So let's multiple the inside and the out, or let's multiple the inside by n, and then we could also divide by n but we could put that outside. They would, it'd be, n divided by n, we haven't changed the value. And so this is going to be equal to three over n pi, that's just what we had out here, times, well the anti-derivative of this business is going to be sine-of-nt, sine-of-nt. And we're gonna evaluate from zero to pi. So this is going to be equal to three over n pi times sine-of-n pi, well that's gonna be zero for any n, minus sine-of-zero times n. Well that's gonna be zero for any n. So all of this is just going to be zero. So a-sub-n is going to be equal to zero. The coefficient on any, for any, of a-sub-ns for any n not equal zero, it's going to be zero. So actually we're not gonna have any of these cosines show up in the Fourier expansion. Let's think about our b-sub-n. When you look at the shape of the square wave, it actually makes a lot of sense. But let's now tackle our b-sub-ns. So our b-sub-ns, get a little space here. So b-sub-n. Same thing, we could just worry about the interval from zero to pi because from pi to two pi our f-of-t is going to be equal to zero. So this is going to be equal to one over pi times the definite integral, once again I'm only gonna worry about from zero to pi, zero to pi dt. Now the value of the function from zero to pi is three, we've seen that before, I could put it here, but just to get a little bit simpler, let's just stick it right over here. Just gonna be three, actually I don't wanna skip too many steps. It's gonna be three times sine-of-nt. Three sine-of-nt. Now let's see. How can I reconstruct this so it's easy to take the anti-derivative? Well this is going to be, we take that three out front, it's gonna be three over pi. And then you have your definite integral from zero to pi of sine-of, we'll do that same color, sine-of-nt. Sine-of-nt dt. And we know the derivative of cosine-nt is negative n sine-of-nt, so let's throw a negative n in here. So negative n. Let's also divide by negative n. Just like that. If you have negative n divided by negative n, we haven't changed the value. That's just one. And so this is going to be equal to negative three over n pi times, we're going to take the anti-derivative here, so this is gonna be cosine-of-nt evaluated from zero zero to pi. And so, what is this? This is going to be equal to, this is equal to negative three over n pi. Cosine-of-zero n, that's gonna be one for any n, minus cosine-of Oh sorry. Why did I start at zero? It's gonna be cosine-of-n pi, cosine-of-n pi minus cosine-of-n times zero. So minus cosine-of-zero, cosine-of-zero is just gonna be one for any n. And so there you have it. We have a general And you might say, ""Well, cosine-of-n pi, ""is that positive one, or is that negative one?"" Well, it depends. If n is, if n is even, this is going to be positive one. If n is odd, this is going to be negative one. So it depends. And actually let's just write that out. So b-sub-n, b-sub-n is equal to, let's write those two cases. So if n is if n is even, and, another one, if n is odd. So if n is even, you're gonna have negative three over n pi times Actually let me just do it over here so we have the space. So what would this thing evaluate to if n is even? So this n, if it's even it'd be like cosine-of-two pi, cosine-of-four pi, cosine-of-six pi. Well in that situation, this is going to evaluate to one. You're gonna have one minus one, which is zero, so the whole thing is gonna evaluate to zero. And if n is odd, cosine-of-pi, cosine-of-three pi, cosine-of-five pi, well those are gonna evaluate to negative one. Then it's gonna be negative one if n is odd. Negative one minus one is negative two, and so this is all gonna be negative two. Negative two times negative three over n pi is going to be six. Six over n pi. So there you have it. We have been able to figure out our Fourier expansion. It is going to be, our square wave, and we definitely deserve a drumroll, this is many videos in the making, f-of-t is going to be equal to a-sub-zero, we figured out in this video is equal to three halves. So it's gonna be three halves. Let me write this. Well I'm just write it all in yellow. So three halves. Now we don't have any a-sub-ns. We figured that out. All of the a-sub-ns are going to be zero. And then the b, the only b-sub-ns we have is when n is odd. When n is odd. So, we're gonna have b-sub-one. So that's gonna be six over one pi. Six over one pi. Sine-of-one times t. So sine-of-t. Plus, now we're not gonna have a b-sub-two, we're gonna have a b-sub-three. So six over three pi times sine-of-three t, and of course this is the same thing as, 1this is the same thing as two over pi times sine of three t, 1plus, now we're not gonna have a b-sub-four, 1we're gonna have a b-sub-five. 1So that's going to be 1six over five pi. 1Actually I liked writing, 1it's nicer to actually not simplify here 1because you can see the pattern. 1So it's gonna be plus six over five pi 1times sine-of-five t. 1And we're just gonna go on and on and on. 1And there you have it. 1We have our Fourier expansion. 1In the next video, we're actually going to visualize this.",science_electrical-engineering_ee-signals
" If you followed some of the mathematics, and some of the thermodynamic principles in the last several videos, what occurs in this video might just blow your mind. So not to set expectations too high, let's just start off with it. So let's say I have a container. And in that container, I have gas particles. Inside of that container, they're bouncing around like gas particles tend to do, creating some pressure on the container of a certain volume. And let's say I have n particles. Now, each of these particles could be in x different states. Let me write that down. What do I mean by state? Well, let's say I take particle A. Let me make particle A a different color. Particle A could be down here in this corner, and it could have some velocity like that. It could also be in that corner and have a velocity like that. Those would be two different states. It could be up here, and have a velocity like that. It could be there and have a velocity like that. If you were to add up all the different states, and there would be a gazillion, of them, you would get x. That blue particle could have x different states. You don't know. We're just saying, look. I have this container. It's got n particles. So we just know that each of them could be in x different states. Now, if each of them can be in x different states, how many total configurations are there for the system as a whole? Well, particle A could be in x different states, and then particle B could be in x different places. So times x. If we just had two particles, then you would multiply all the different places where X could be times all the different places where the red particle could be, then you'd get all the different configurations for the system. But we don't have just two particles. We have n particles. So for every particle, you'd multiply it times the number of states it could have, and you do that a total of n times. And this is really just combinatorics here. You do it n times. This system would have n configurations. For example, if I had two particles, each particle had three different potential states, how many different configurations could there be? Well, for every three that one particle could have, the other one could have three different states, so you'd have nine different states. You'd multiply them. If you had another particle with three different states, you'd multiply that by three, so you have 27 different states. Here we have n particles. Each of them could be in x different states. So the total number of configurations we have for our system-- x times itself n times is just x to the n. So we have x to the n states in our system. Now, let's say that we like thinking about how many states a system can have. Certain states have less-- for example, if I had fewer particles, I would have fewer potential states. Or maybe if I had a smaller container, I would also have fewer potential states. There would be fewer potential places for our little particles to exist. So I want to create some type of state variable that tells me, well, how many states can my system be in? So this is kind of a macrostate variable. It tells me, how many states can my system be in? And let's call it s for states. For the first time in thermodynamics, we're actually using a letter that in some way is related to what we're actually trying to measure. s for states. And since the states, they can grow really large, let's say I like to take the logarithm of the number of states. Now this is just how I'm defining my state variable. I get to define it. So I get to put a logarithm out front. So let me just put a logarithm. So in this case, it would be the logarithm of my number of states-- so it would be x to the n, where this is number of potential states. And you know, we need some kind of scaling factor. Maybe I'll change the units eventually. So let me put a little constant out front. Every good formula needs a constant to get our units right. I'll make that a lowercase k. So that's my definition. I call this my state variable. If you give me a system, I should, in theory, be able to tell you how many states the system can take on. Fair enough. So let me close that box right there. Now let's say that I were to take my box that I had-- let me copy and paste it. I take that box. And it just so happens that there was an adjacent box next to it. They share this wall. They're identical in size, although what I just drew isn't identical in size. But they're close enough. They're identical in size. And what I do, is I blow away this wall. I just evaporate it, all of a sudden. It just disappears. So this wall just disappears. Now, what's going to happen? Well, as soon as I blow away this wall, this is very much not an isostatic process. Right? All hell's going to break loose. I'm going to blow away this wall, and you know, the particles that were about to bounce off the wall are just going to keep going. Right? They're going to keep going until they can maybe bounce off of that wall. So right when I blow away this wall, there's no pressure here, because these guys have nothing to bounce off to. While these guys don't know anything. They don't know anything until they come over here and say, oh, no wall. So the pressure is in flux. Even the volume is in flux, as these guys make their way across the entire expanse of the new volume. So everything is in flux. Right? And so what's our new volume? If we call this volume, what's this? This is now 2 times the volume. Let's think about some of the other state variables we know. We know that the pressure is going to go down. We can even relate it, because we know that our volume is twice it. Is 2 times the volume. What about the temperature? Well, the temperature change. Temperature is average kinetic energy, right? Or it's a measure of average kinetic energy. So all of these molecules here, each of them have kinetic energy. They could be different amounts of kinetic energy, but temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy. Now, if I blow away this wall, does that change the kinetic energy of these molecules? No! It doesn't change it at all. So the temperature is constant. So if this is T1, then the temperature of this system here is T1. And you might say, hey, Sal, wait, that doesn't make sense. In the past, when my cylinder expanded, my temperature went down. And the reason why the temperature went down in that case is because your molecules were doing work. They expanded the container itself. They pushed up the cylinder. So they expended some of their kinetic energy to do the work. In this case, I just blew away that wall. These guys did no work whatsoever, so they didn't have to expend any of their kinetic energy to do any work. So their temperature did not change. So that's interesting. Fair enough. Well, in this new world, what happens? Eventually I get to a situation where my molecules fill the container. Right? We know that from common sense. And if you think about it on a microlevel, why does that happen? It's not a mystery. You know, on this direction, things were bouncing and they keep bouncing. But when they go here, there used to be a wall, and then they'll just keep going, and then they'll start bouncing here. So when you have gazillion particles doing a gazillion of these bounces, eventually, they're just as likely to be here as they are over there. Now. Let's do our computation again. In our old situation, when we just looked at this, each particle could be in one of x places, or in one of x states. Now it could be in twice as many states, right? Now, each particle could be in 2x different states. Why do I say 2x? Because I have twice the area to be in. Now, the states aren't just, you know, position in space. But everything else-- so, you know, before here, maybe I had a positions in space times b positions, or b momentums, you know, where those are all the different momentums, and that was equal to x. Now I have 2a positions in volume that I could be in. I have twice the volume to deal with. So I have 2a positions in volume I can be at, but my momentum states are going to still be-- I just have b momentum states-- so this is equal to 2x. I now can be in 2x different states, just because I have 2 times the volume to travel around in, right? So how many states are there for the system? Well, each particle can be in 2x states. So this is 2x times 2x times 2x. And I'm going to do that n times. So my new s-- so this is, you know, let's call this s initial-- so my s final, my new way of measuring my states, is going to be equal to that little constant that I threw in there, times the natural log of the new number of states. So what is it? It's 2x to the n power. So my question to you is, what is my change in s when I blew away the wall? You know, there was this room here the entire time, although these particles really didn't care because this wall was there. So what is the change in s when I blew away this wall? And this should be clear. The temperature didn't change, because no 1kinetic energy was expended. 1And this is all in isolation. 1I should have said. 1It's adiabatic. 1There's no transfer of heat. 1So that's also why the temperature didn't change. 1So what is our change in s? 1Our change in s is equal to our s final minus our s 1initial, which is equal to-- what's our s final? 1It's this expression, right here. 1It is k times the natural log--and we can write this as 12 to the n, x to the n. 1That's just exponent rules. 1And from that, we're going to subtract out our initial s 1value, which was this. k natural log of x to the n. 1Now we can use our logarithm properties to say, well, you 1know, you take the logarithm of a minus the logarithm of b, 1you can just divide them. 1So this is equal to k-- you could factor that out-- times 1the logarithm of 2 to the N-- it's uppercase N, 1so let me do that. 1This is uppercase N. 1I don't want to get confused with Moles. 1Uppercase N is the number of particles we actually have. So 1it's 2 to upper case N times x to the uppercase N divided by 1x to the uppercase N. 1So these two cancel out. 1So our change in s is equal to k times the natural log of 2 1to the N-- or, if we wanted to use our logarithm properties, 1we could throw that N out front. 1And we could say, our change in the s, whatever this state 1variable I've defined-- and this is a different definition 1than I did in the last video-- is equal to big N, the number 1of molecules we have, times my little constant, times the 1natural log of 2. 1So by blowing away that wall and giving my molecules twice 1as much volume to travel around in, my change in this 1little state function I defined is Nk the 1natural log of 2. 1And what really happened? 1I mean, it clearly went up, right? 1I clearly have a positive value here. 1Natural log of 2 is a positive value. 1N is positive value. 1It's going to be very large number than the number of 1molecules we had. 1And I'm assuming my constant I threw on there 1is a positive value. 1But what am I really describing? 1I'm saying that look, by blowing away that wall, my 1system can take on more states. 1There's more different things it can do. 1And I'll throw a little word out here. 1Its entropy has gone up. 1Well, actually, let's just define s 1to be the word entropy. 1We'll talk more about the word in the future. 1Its entropy has gone up, which means the number of states we 1have has gone up. 1I shouldn't use the word entropy without just saying, 1entropy I'm defining as equal to S. 1But let's just keep it with s. s for states. 1The number of states we're dealing with has gone up, and 1it's gone up by this factor. 1Actually, it's gone up by a factor of 2 to the n. 1And that's why it becomes n natural log of 2. 1Fair enough. 1Now you're saying, OK. 1This is nice, Sal. 1You have this statistical way, or I guess you could, this 1combinatoric way of measuring how many states this system 1can take on. 1And you looked at the actual molecules. 1You weren't looking at the kind of macrostates. 1And you were able to do that. 1You came up with this macrostate that says, that's 1essentially saying, how many states can I have? 1But how does that relate to that s that defined in the 1previous video? 1Remember, in the previous video, I was looking for state 1function that dealt with heat. 1And I defined s, or change in s-- I defined as change in s-- 1to be equal to the heat added to the system divided by the 1temperature that the heat was added at. 1So let's see if we can see whether these things are 1somehow related. 1So let's go back to our system, and go to a PV 1diagram, and see if we can do anything useful with that. 1Alright. 1OK. 1So this is pressure, this is volume. 1Now. 1When we started off, before we blew away the wall, we had 1some pressure and some volume. 1So this is V1. 1And then we blew away the wall, and we got to-- 1Actually, let me do it a little bit differently. 1I want that to be just right there. 1Let me make it right there. 1So that is our V1. 1This is our original state that we're in. 1So state initial, or however we want it. 1That's our initial pressure. 1And then we blew away the wall, and our 1volume doubled, right? 1So we could call this 2V1. 1Our volume doubled, our pressure would have gone down, 1and we're here. 1Right? 1That's our state 2. 1That's this scenario right here, after we 1blew away the wall. 1Now, what we did was not a quasistatic process. 1I can't draw the path here, because right when I blew away 1the wall, all hell broke loose, and things like 1pressure and volume weren't well defined. 1Eventually it got back to an equilibrium where this filled 1the container, and nothing else was in flux. 1And we could go back to here, and we could say, OK, now the 1pressure and the volume is this. 1But we don't know what happened in between that. 1So if we wanted to figure out our Q/T, or the heat into the 1system, we learned in the last video, the heat added to the 1system is equal to the work done by the system. 1We'd be at a loss, because the work done by the system is the 1area under some curve, but there's no curve to speak of 1here, because our system wasn't defined while all the 1hell had broke loose. 1So what can we do? 1Well, remember, this is a state function. 1And this is a state function. 1And I showed that in the last video. 1So it shouldn't be dependent on how we got 1from there to there. 1Right? 1So this change in entropy-- actually, let me be careful 1with my words. 1This change in s, so s2 minus s1, should be independent of 1the process that got me from s1 to s2. 1So this is independent of whatever crazy path-- I mean, 1I could have taken some crazy, quasistatic 1path like that, right? 1So any path that goes from this s1 to this s2 will have 1the same heat going into the system, or should have the 1same-- let me take that-- 1Any system that goes from s1 to s2, regardless of its path, 1will have the same change in entropy, or their 1same change in s. 1Because their s was something here, and it's something 1different over here. 1And you just take the difference between the two. 1So what's a system that we know that can do that? 1Well, let's say that we did an isothermal. 1And we know that these are all the same isotherm, right? 1We know that the temperature didn't change. 1I told you that. 1Because no kinetic energy was expended, and none of the 1particles did any work. 1So we can say, we can think of a theoretical process in which 1instead of doing something like that, we could have had a 1situation where we started off with our original container 1with our molecules in it. 1We could have put a reservoir here that's equivalent to the 1temperature that we're at. 1And then this could have been a piston that was maybe, we 1were pushing on it with some rocks that are pushing in the 1left-wards direction. 1And we slowly and slowly remove the rocks, so that 1these gases could push the piston and do some work, and 1fill this entire volume, or twice the volume. 1And then the temperature would have been kept constant by 1this heat reservoir. 1So this type of a process is kind of a sideways version of 1what I've done in the Carnot diagrams. That would be 1described like this. 1You'd go from this state to that state, and it would be a 1quasistatic static process along an isotherm. 1So it would look like that. 1So you could have a curve there. 1Now, for that process, what is the area 1under the curve there? 1Well, the area under the curve is just the integral-- and 1we've done this multiple times-- from our initial 1volume to our second volume, which is twice it, of p times 1our change in volume, right? 1p is our height, times our little changes in volume, give 1us each rectangle. 1And then the integral is just the sum along all of these. 1So that's essentially the work that this system does. 1Right? 1And the work that this system does, since we are on an 1isotherm, it is equal to the heat added to the system. 1Because our internal energy didn't change. 1So what is this? 1We've done this multiple times, but I'll redo it. 1So this is equal to the integral of V1 to 2V1. 1PV equals NRT, right? 1NRT. 1So P is equal to NRT/V. 1NRT over V dv. 1And the t is T1. 1Now, all of this is happening along an isotherm, so all of 1these terms are constant. 1So this is equal to the integral from V1 to 2V1 of 1NRT1 times 1 over V dv. 1I've done this integral multiple times. 1And so this is equal to-- I'll skip a couple of steps here, 1because I've done it in several videos already-- the 1natural log of 2V1 over V1, right? 1The antiderivative of this is the natural log. 1Take the natural log of that minus the natural log of that, 1which is equal to the natural log of 2V1 over V1. 1Which is just the same thing as NRT1 times the 1natural log of 2. 2Interesting. 2Now, let's add one little one little interesting thing to 2this to this equation. 2So this is NRT, but if I wanted to write in terms of 2the number of molecules, N is the number of moles. 2So I could rewrite N as the number of molecules we have 2divided by, 6 times 10 to the 23 power. 2Right? 2That's what n could be written as. 2So if we do it that way, then what is our-- remember, all of 2this, we were trying to find the amount of 2work done by our system. 2Right? 2But if we do it this way, this equation will turn 2into-- so let's see. 2The work done by our system-- this is our quasistatic 2processes that's going from this state to that state, but 2it's doing it in a quasistatic way, so that we can get an 2area under the curve. 2So the work done by this system is equal to-- 2I'll just write it. 2N times R over 6 times 10 to the 23, times T1 2natural log of 2. 2Fair enough. 2Let's make this into some new constant. 2For convenience, let me call it a lowercase k. 2So the work we did is equal to the number of particles we 2had, times some new constant-- we'll call that Boltzmann 2constant, so it's really just 8 divided by that. 2Times T1, times the natural log of 2. 2Fair enough. 2Now, that's only in this situation. 2The other situation did no work, right? 2So I can't talk about this system doing any work. 2But this system did do some work. 2And since it did it along an isotherm, delta-- the change 2in internal energy is equal to 0, so the change in internal 2energy, which is equal to the heat applied to the system 2minus the work done by the system-- this is going to be 2equal to 0, since our temperature didn't change. 2So the work is going to be equal to the heat 2added to the system. 2So the heat added to the system by our little reservoir 2there is going to be-- so the heat is going to be the number 2of particles we had times Boltzmann constant, times our 2temperature that we're on the isotherm, times the 2natural log of 2. 2And all this is a byproduct of the fact that 2we doubled our volume. 2Now, in the last video, I defined change in s as equal 2to Q divided by the heat added, divided by the 2temperature at which I'm adding it. 2So for this system, this quasistatic system, what was 2the change in s? 2How much did our s-term, our s-state, change by? 2So change in s is equal to heat added divided by our 2temperature. 2Our temperature is T1, so that's equal to this thing. 2Nk T1 times the natural log of 2, all of that over T1. 2So our delta-- these cancel out. 2And our change in our s-quantity is equal to Nk 2times the natural log of 2. 2Now, you should be starting to experience an a-ha moment. 2When we defined in the previous video, we were just 2playing with thermodynamics, and we said, gee, we'd really 2like to have a state variable that deals with heat, and we 2just made up this thing right here that said, change in that 2state variable is equal to the heat applied to the system 2divided by the temperature at which the heat was applied. 2And when we use that definition the change in our 2s-value from this position to this position, for a 2quasi-static process, ended up being this. 2Nk natural log of 2. 2Now, this is a state function. 2State variable. 2It's not dependent on the path. 2So any process that gets from here, that gets from this 2point to that point, has to have the same change in s. 2So the delta s for any process is going to be equal to that 2same value, which was N, in this case, k, times the 2natural log of 2. 2Any system, by our definition, right? 2It's the state variable. 2I don't care whether it disappeared, or the path was 2some crazy path. 2It's a state. 2It's only a function of that and of that, our change in s. 2So given that, even this system-- we said that this 2system that we started the video out with, it started off 2at this same V1, and it got to the same V2. 2So by the definition of the previous video, by this 2definition, its change in s is going to be the number of 2molecules times some constant times the natural log of 2. 2Now, that's the same exact result we got when we thought 2about it from a statistical point of view, when we were 2saying, how many more different states can the 2system take on? 2And what's mind-blowing here is that what we started off 2with was just kind of a nice, you know, macrostate in our 2little Carnot engine world, that we didn't really know 2what it meant. 2But we got the same exact result that when we try to do 2it from a measuring the number of states the 2system could take on. 2So all of this has been a long, two-video-winded version 2of an introduction to entropy. 2And in thermodynamics, a change in entropy-- entropy is 2s, or I think of it, s for states-- the thermodynamic, or 2Carnot cycle, or Carnot engine world, is defined as the 2change in entropy is defined as the heat added to the 2system divided by the temperature at 2which it was added. 2Now, in our statistical mechanics world, we can define 2entropy as some constant-- and it's especially convenient, 2this is Boltzmann's constant-- some constant times the 2natural log of the number of states we have. Sometimes it's 2written as omega, sometimes other things. 2But this time, it's the number of states we have. 2And what just showed in this video is, these are equivalent 2definitions. 2or. 2At least for that one case I just showed you. 2These are equivalent definitions. 2When we used the number of states for this, how much did 2it increase, we got this result. 2And then when we used the thermodynamic definition of 2it, we got that same result. 2And if we assume that this constant is the same as that 2constant, if they're both Boltzmann's constant, both 1.3 2times 10 to the minus 23, then our definitions are 2equivalent. 2And so the intuition of entropy-- in the last one, we 2were kind of struggling with that. 2We just defined it this way, but we were like, what does 2that really mean? 2What change in entropy means, is just how many more states 2can the system take on? 2You know, sometimes when you learn it in your high school 2chemistry class, they'll call it disorder. 2And it is disorder. 2But I don't want you to think that somehow, you know, a 2messy room has higher entropy than a clean room, which some 2people sometimes use as an example. 2That's not the case. 2What you should say is, is that a stadium full of people 2has more states than a stadium without people in it. 2That has more entropy. 2Or actually, I should even be careful there. 2Let me say, a stadium at a high temperature has more 2entropy than the inside of my refrigerator. 2That the particles in that stadium have more potential 2states than the particles in my refrigerator. 2Now I'm going to leave you there, and we're going to take 2our definitions here, which I think are pretty profound-- 2this and this is the same definition-- and we're going 2to apply that to talk about the second law of 2thermodynamics. 2And actually, just a little aside. 2I wrote omega here, but in our example, this was 2 to the N. 2And so that's why it's simplified. 2This was x the first time, and then the second time, when we 2double the size of our room, or our volume, it was x to the 2N times 2 to N. 2I just want to make sure you realize what omega relates to, 2relative to what I just went through. 2Anyway, see you in the next video.",science_chemistry_thermodynamics-chemistry
" -  Let's say that Y is equal to sin of X squared to the third power, which of course we could also write as sin of X squared to the third power and what we're curious about is what is the derivative of this with respect to X? What is DY/DX which we could also write as Y prime? Well, there's a couple of ways to think about it. This isn't a straightforward expression here but you might notice that I have something being raised to the third power, in fact, if we look at the outside of this expression we have some business in here that's being raised to the third power. And so, one way to tackle this is to apply the chain rule. So, if we apply the chain rule it's gonna be the derivative of the outside with respect to the inside or the something to the third power, the derivative of the something to the third power with respect to that something. So, it's going to be three times that something squared times the derivative with respect to X of that something, in this case, the something is sin, let me write that in the blue color, it is sin of X squared. It is sin of X squared. No matter what was inside of these orange parentheses I would put it inside of the orange parentheses and these orange brackets right over here. We learned that in the chain rule. So, let's see, we know this is just a matter of the first part of the expression is just a matter of algebraic simplification but the second part we need to now take the derivative of sin of X squared. Well, now we would want to use the chain rule again. So, I'm going to take the derivative, it's sin of something, so this is going to be, the derivative of this is gonna be the sin of something with respect to something, so that is cosine of that something times the derivative with respect to X of the something. In this case, the something is our X squared and of course, we have all of this out front which is the three times sin of X squared, I could write it like this, squared. Alright, so we're getting close. Now we just have to figure out the derivative with respect to X of X squared and we've seen that many times before. That, we just use the power rule, that's going to be two X. Two X and so, if we wanted to write the DY/DX, let me get a little bit of a mini drum roll here, this shouldn't take us too long, DY/DX, I'll multiply the three times the two X which is going to be six X, so I've covered those so far times sin squared of X squared, times sin squared of X squared, times cosine of X squared. And we are done applying the chain rule multiple times.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-differentiation-2-new
" -  What I'd like to do in this video is try to figure out what x to the fourth minus two x to the third plus five x divided by x is equal to. So pause this video and see if you can have a go at that before we work through this together. All right, so if we're saying what is this top expression divided by this bottom expression, another way to think about it is, what do I have to multiply, so I'm going to multiply something, I'll put that in parentheses. If I multiply that something times x, I should get x to the fourth minus two x to the third plus five x. Now how do I approach that? Well there's two ways that I could tackle it. One way is I could just rewrite this expression as being, and I will just make this x in yellow so I can keep track of it. I could just rewrite this as one over x times, times x to the fourth minus two x to the third plus five x. And then I can distribute the one over x, and so what is that going to be equal to? Well it's going to be equal to x to the fourth. Let me do this, x to the fourth over x minus two x to the third over x plus five x, plus five x over x. And so what are each of these going to be equal to? X to the fourth divided by x, if I have four x's that I'm multiplying together and then I divide by x, that's going to be equivalent to x to the third power. So this right over here is equal to x to the third. You could also get there from your exponent properties. In the denominator, you have an x to the first power, and so you would subtract the exponents. You have the same base here, so that's x to the third. And then, in this part right over here, what would that equal to? Well it's going to be minus two x to the third divided by x to the first. Well by the same property, that's going to be x squared. And then last but not least, if you take five x's and then you divide by x, you are just going to be left with five. And you can verify that this, indeed, if I were to multiply it by x, I'm gonna get x to the fourth minus two x to the third plus five x. Let me do that. If I put x to the third minus two x squared plus five times x, what I could do is distribute the x. X times x to the third is x to the fourth. X times negative two x squared is negative two x to the third. X times five is five x. Now I mentioned there's two ways that I could do it. Another way that I could try to tackle it is I could look at this numerator and try to factor an x out. I would try to factor out whatever I see in the denominator. So if I do that, actually let me just rewrite the numerator. So I can rewrite x to the fourth as x times x to the third. And then I can rewrite the minus two x to the third as, let me write it this way, as plus x times negative two x squared. And then I could write this five x as being equal to plus x times five. And then I'm gonna divide everything by x, divide everything by x. I just rewrote the numerator here, but for each of those terms, I factored out an x. And now I can factor out x out of the whole thing. So I sometimes think of factoring out an x out of the whole thing as reverse distributive property. So if I factor out this x out of every term, what am I left with? I'm left with an x times x to the third minus two x squared plus five; I ended up doing that in the same color, but hopefully you're following, plus five, and then all of that is divided by x. And as long as x does not equal zero, x divided by x is going to be equal to one, and we're left with what we had to begin with, or the answer that we had to begin with. So these are two different approaches. Nothing super sophisticated here. When you're dividing by x, you're just like hey, that's the same thing as multiplying every term by one over x, or you can factor out an x out of the numerator, and then they cancel out.",math_math3_poly-div
" -  Hey guys. There's one more thing I need to talk about before I can describe the vectorized form for the quadratic approximation of multivariable functions which is a mouthful to say so let's say you have some kind of expression that looks like a times x squared and I'm thinking x is a variable times b times xy, y is another variable, plus c times y squared and I'm thinking of a, b and c as being constants and x and y as being variables. Now, this kind of expression has a fancy name. It's called a quadratic form. Quadratic form. And that always threw me off. I always kind of was like, what, what does form mean? I know what a quadratic expression is and quadratic typically means something is squared or you have two variables but why do they call it a form? And basically it just means that the only things in here are quadratic. It's not the case that you have an x term sitting on its own or a constant out here like two when you're adding all of those together instead it's just you have purely quadratic terms but of course, mathematicians don't want to call it just a purely quadratic expression instead they have to give a fancy name to things so that it seems more intimidating than it needs to be but anyways, so we have a quadratic form and the question is how can we express this in a vectorized sense? And for analogy, let's think about linear terms where let's say you have a times x plus b times y and I'll throw another variable in there, another constant times another variable z. If you see something like this where every variable is just being multiplied by a constant and then you add terms like that to each other, we can express this nicely with vectors where you pile all of the constants into their own vector, a vector containing a, b and c and you imagine the dot product between that and a vector that contains all of the variable components, x, y and z and the convenience here is then you can have just a symbol like a v let's say which represents this whole constant vector and then you can write down, take the dot product between that and then have another symbol, maybe a bold faced x which represents a vector that contains all of the variables and this way, your notation just kind of looks like a constant times a variable just like in the single variable world when you have a constant number times a variable number, it's kind of like taking a constant vector times a variable vector. And the importance of writing things down like this is that v could be a vector that contains not just three numbers but a hundred numbers and then x would have a hundred corresponding variables and the notation doesn't become any more complicated. It's generalizable at the higher dimensions. So the question is can be we do something similar like that with our quadratic form? Because you can imagine let's say we started introducing the variable z then you would have to have some other term, some other constant times the xz quadratic term and then some other constant times the z squared quadratic term and another one for the yz quadratic term and it would get out of hand and as soon as you start introducing things like a hundred variables, it would get seriously out of hand because there's a lot of different quadratic terms so we want a nice way to express this. And I'm just going to kind of show you how we do it and then we'll work it through to see why it makes sense. So usually, instead of thinking of b times xy, we actually think of this as two times some constant times xy and this of course doesn't make a difference. You would just change what b represents but you'll see why it's more convenient to write it this way in just a moment. So the vectorized way to describe a quadratic form like this is to take a matrix, a two by two matrix since this is two dimensions where a and c are in the diagonal and then b is on the other diagonal and we always think of these as being symmetric matrices so if you imagine kind of reflecting the whole matrix about this line, you'll get the same number so it's important that we have that kind of symmetry. And now what you do is you multiply the vector, the variable vector that's got x, y on the right side of this matrix and then you multiply it again but you turn it on its side so instead of being a vertical vector, you transpose it to being a horizontal vector on the other side. And this is a little bit analogous too having two variables multiplied in. You have two vectors multiplied in but on either side. And this is a good point by the way if you are uncomfortable with matrix multiplication to maybe pause the video, go find the videos about matrix multiplication and kind of refresh or learn about that because moving forward, I'm just going to assume that it's something you're familiar with. So going about computing this, first, let's tackle this right multiplication here. We have a matrix multiplied by a vector. Well, the first component that we get, we're going to multiply the top row by each corresponding term in the vector so it'll be a times x. a times x plus b times y. Plus b times that second term y and then similarly for the bottom term, we'll take the bottom row and multiply the corresponding terms so b times x. b times x plus c times y. c times y. So that's what it looks like when we do that right multiplication and of course we've got to keep our transposed vector over there on the right, on the left side. So now, we have, this is just a two by one vector now and this is a one by two. You could think of it as a horizontal vector or a one by two matrix but now when we multiply these guys, you just kind of line up the corresponding terms. You'll have x multiplied by that entire top expression so x multiplied by ax plus by. ax plus by and then we add that to the second term y multiplied by the second term of this guy which is bx plus cy so y multiplied by bx plus cy and all of these are numbers so we can simplify it once we start distributing the first term is x times a times x so that's ax squared and then the next term is x times b times y so that's b times xy. Over here, we have y times b times x so that's the same thing as b times xy so that's kind of why we have, why it's convenient to write a two there because that naturally comes out of our expansion. And then the last term is y times c times y so that's cy squared. So we get back the original quadratic form that we were shooting for. ax squared plus two bxy plus cy squared That's how this entire term expands. As you kind of work it through, you end up with the same quadratic expression. Now, the convenience of this quadratic form being written with a matrix like this is that we can write this more abstractally and instead of writing the whole matrix in, you could just let a letter like m represent that whole matrix and then take the vector that represents the variable, maybe a bold faced x and you would multiply it on the right and then you transpose it and multiply it on the left so typically you denote that by putting a little t as a superscript so x transposed multiplied by the matrix from the left and this expression, this is what a quadratic form looks like in vectorized form and the convenience is the same as it was in the linear case. Just like v could represent something that had a hundred different numbers in it and x would have a hundred different constants, you could do something similar here where you can write that same expression even if the matrix m is super huge. Let's just see what this would look like in a three dimensional circumstance so, actually, I'll need more room so I'll go down even further. So we have x transpose multiplied by the matrix multiplied by x, bold faced x and let's say instead this represented, you have x then y then z, our transposed vector and then our matrix, our matrix let's say was a, b, c, d, e, f and because it needs to be symmetric, whatever term is in this spot here needs to be the same as over here kind of when you reflect it about that diagonal. Similarly, c, that's going to be the same term here and e would be over here. So there's only really six free terms that you have but if fills up this entire matrix and then on the right side, we would multiply that by x, y, z. Now, I won't work it out in this video but you can imagine actually multiplying this matrix by this vector and then multiplying the corresponding vector that you get by this transposed vector and you'll get some kind of quadratic form with three variables and the point is you'll get a very complicated one but it's very simple to express things like this. So with that tool in hand, in the next video, I will talk about how we can use this notation to express the quadratic approximations for multivariable functions. See you then.",math_multivariable-calculus_applications-of-multivariable-derivatives

" So I have six different expressions here, and what I want you to do is pause this video and try to calculate the value of each of these expressions. I'm assuming you've given a go at it. Now let's work through them. So when we see something like this, we have to remember our order of operations. We have 2 times 3 squared, and we have to remember that the first thing we would need to think about are the parentheses. I'll just write paren for short. Then we worry about exponents. Then we will worry about multiplication and division, and actually let me write it this way. We worry about multiplication and division. And then we worry about addition and subtraction. So in this expression right over here, there are no parentheses, so we do the exponents first. So we calculate what 3 squared is. 3 times 3 is 9, so this becomes 2 times 9, which is equal to 18. Now let's look at this one, and this one is interesting, because they have-- it looks like the same expression, but now there are parentheses. And because of these parentheses, we're going to do the multiplication before we take the exponent. So 2 times 3 is going to be 6, and we're going to take that to the second power. So that's 6 times 6, which is equal to 36. Now let's think about this one right over here. Once again, we want to do our multiplication and our division first. So we have a division right over here. 81/9 is the same thing as 81 divided by 9, and that's going to be 9. And then we have-- so it becomes 1 plus 5 times 9. Now we want to do the multiplication before we do the addition, so we're going to do our 5 times 9, which is 45. So this becomes 1 plus 45, which of course is equal to 46. Now let's tackle this one right over here. So, we would want to do the exponents first. So, 1 squared, well that's just going-- let me do this in a different color. 1 squared is just going to be equal to 1, so that's just going to be equal to 1. And so you have 2 times 4 plus 1. What should you do? Should you add first or do the multiplication first? Well multiplication takes precedence over addition, so you're going to do the 2 times 4 first. 2 times 4 is 8, so you're going to have 8 plus 1, which of course is equal to 9. Now you have a very similar expression, but you have parentheses. So that's going to force you to do what's in the parentheses before you take the exponent. But within the parentheses we have multiplication and addition, and we have to remember that we do the multiplication first. So we're going to do the 2 times 4 first, so that's going to be 8 plus 1 to the second power. 8 plus 1 is 9, so that's 9 to the second power. 9 squared is the same thing as 9 times 9, which is equal to 81. Now we have one more right over here that looks very similar to this one, except, once again, we have parentheses that's making us do the addition first. Without parentheses, we would do the multiplication and the division first. But here, we see that 1 plus 5 is 6, and then we have this 81/9, which is 9. So this simplifies to 6 times 9, which of course is equal to 54.",math_cc-sixth-grade-math_cc-6th-arithmetic-operations
" -  We've already seen the equation on the left, which relates the standard change of free energy, delta G zero, to the standard cell potential, E zero. The equation on the right is from thermodynamics and it relates the standard change in free energy, delta G zero, to the equilibrium constant, K. So, we can set these equal to each other to relate the standard cell potential to the equilibrium constant. Since both of these are equal to delta G zero, we can say that this is equal to this. So, now we have negative NFE zero is equal to negative RT natural log of the equilibrium constant, K. Now let's solve for E zero. Let's solve for the standard cell potential. So, to do that, we need to divide both sides by negative NF. So, we get E zero is equal to positive RT over NF natural log of our equilibrium constant. Next, we're gonna solve for what this is equal to. So, if we're at 25 degrees C, alright, so our temperature under standard conditions for our cells that we've been talking about, T is in Kelvin, so we need to convert degrees Celsius into Kelvin, and to do that, you need to add 273.15. So, that gives us 298.15 Kelvin. So, that's what this T is, it's our absolute temperature in Kelvin. R is the gas constant. So, R is equal to 8.314 joules over mole times Kelvin, here. So, we're gonna multiply that by our absolute temperature. And so, our absolute temperature was 298.15, so, this is 298.15 Kelvin. This is all over Faraday's constant. Alright, so remember, F is Faraday's constant. So, this F right here, Faraday's constant, which is 96,500 coulombs per mole, so, the charge of one mole of electrons. So, this give us RT over F. And so, let's get out the calculator and find what this is equal to, here. So, we have 8.314 times 298.1, lemme go back here, .15, and then we're going to divide that by Faraday's constant, 96,500. And so, we get .0257. So, let's round that. .0257, so this give us .0257. What will the units be? Well, Kelvin would cancel out, here, and, let's see, what else cancels out, the moles would cancel out, and that gives us joules over coulombs. Which, of course, is equal to volts. Alright, so we can rewrite our equation, so, the one we had up here. So, we're gonna plug in for RT over F, now. So, now we would have the standard cell potential, E zero, is equal to, well this would be .0257 and that was volts over N. Remember, N is the number of moles that are transferred in your redox reaction. And this is times the natural log of K, our equilibrium constant, here. So, this is one form of the equation that relates the standard cell potential, alright, the standard cell potential E zero, to the equilibrium constant, K. We can write this in a different way. Alright, so what we could do is we could take that .0257, .0257, and we can multiply that by the natural log of ten. So, let's do that. So, we have .0257 times the natural log of ten. And that gives us .0592. So, we get .0592. And the reason why we could do this is to write our equation in log form. Alright, up here, we have natural log, so up here, we have a natural log, but now, we can write it in log form. So, now we have the standard cell potential, E zero, is equal to, well now, we'd have .0592 volts. So, we have .0592 volts, once again, over N, the number of moles of electrons transferred in our redox reaction. And this time, it would be times the log of K. So, not the natural log, the log of K. So, we've taken care of that in our calculation. So, this is just another form of the same equation. Alright, relating the standard cell potential, E zero, to the equilibrium constant, K.",science_chemistry_oxidation-reduction
" -  Let's look at three types of radioactive decay, and we'll start with alpha decay. In alpha decay, an alpha particle is ejected from an unstable nucleus, so here's our unstable nucleus, uranium-238. An alpha particle has the same composition as a helium nucleus. We saw the helium nucleus in the previous video. There are two protons in the helium nucleus and two neutrons. So I go ahead and draw in my two neutrons here. Since there are two protons, the charge of an alpha particle is two plus. So for representing an alpha particle in our nuclear equation, since an alpha particle has the same composition as a helium nucleus, we put an He in here, and it has two positive charges, so we put a two down here, and then a total of four nucleons, so we put a four here. Trying to figure out the other product from our nuclear equation, I know nucleons are conserved, so if I have 238 nucleons on the left, I need 238 nucleons on the right. Well, I have four from my alpha particle, so I need 234 more. So 234 plus four gives me a total of 238 on the right, and so therefore nucleons are conserved here. In terms of charge, I know charge is also conserved. On the left, I know I have 92 protons, so 92 positive charges on the left. I need 92 positive charges on the right. We already have two positive charges from our alpha particle, and so we need 90 more. So we need 90 positive charges. We need an atomic number here of 90. The identity of the other product, just look it up here at our table, find atomic number of 90, and you'll see that's thorium here. So thorium-234 is our other product. So we think about what's happening visually, we're starting off with a uranium nucleus which is unstable, it's going to eject an alpha particle, so an alpha particle is ejected from this nucleus, so we're losing this alpha particle, and what's left behind is this thorium nucleus. So this is just a visual representation of what's going on here, in our nuclear equation. Let's do beta decay. So in beta decay, an electron is ejected from the nucleus. We saw in the previous video that you represent an electron, since it has a negative one charge, you put a negative one down here, it's not a proton, nor is it a neutron, so we put a zero here. So here's our electron and an electron ejected from the nucleus is called a beta particle. We could put a beta here, and it's an electron, so a negative one charge, and then a zero here. If a beta particle is ejected from the nucleus of a thorium-234, so we're starting with thorium-234, this nucleus ejects a beta particle, so we go ahead and put a beta particle in here, so zero and negative one, what else is produced here? What else do we make? Well, once again, the number of nucleons is conserved, so I have 234 nucleons on the left, I need 234 on the right. I have a zero here, so I need 234 nucleons. Charge is also conserved, so I have 90 positive charges on the left, I have 90 protons. On the right, I have a negative charge here, so I have a negative one charge, and so I must need 91 positive charges, because 91 positive charges and one negative charge gives me 90 positive charges on the right. So I need an atomic number of 91. If you look at the periodic table, and you find the atomic number of 91, you'll see that this is protactinium. So we're going to make protactinium here, so Pa. What is happening in beta decay? Let's look at it in a little bit more detail. We already talked about the number of protons, so we have 90 protons on the left, how many neutrons do we have? Well, 234 minus 90, 234 minus 90 gives us the number of neutrons. That's 144 neutrons. On the right, we have 91 protons, how many neutrons do we have? Well, that'd be 234 minus 91. So 234 minus 91 gives us 143 neutrons. So we went from 144 neutrons on the left to 143 neutrons on the right, and we went from 90 protons on the left, to 91 protons on the right. So we lost a neutron, and we gained a proton. You could think about the neutron turning into a proton, and this is an oversimplified way of thinking about it. Let's go ahead and write that down here. So a neutron turning into a proton. So a neutron has no charge, so we put a zero here. And a neutron is a nucleon, so we put a one right here. So a neutron is turning into a proton, so let's go ahead and write our proton here. A proton has a plus one charge, and it's a nucleon so we put a one here. When we think about what else is made, we know that nucleons are conserved, so we have one nucleon on the left, one nucleon on the right. Therefore, we would have a zero here. In terms of charge, if we have zero charge on the left, plus one on the right, we need negative one right here. This of course represents the electron, so this is the electron that's ejected from the nucleus. This is our beta particle. And also actually, something else is produced. You're also going to make an anti-neutrino, and that's just really not part of this video, so we'll just ignore it for now. So a neutron has turned into a proton, and we're also getting a beta particle ejected from the nucleus. When this conversion, this process is actually governed by the weak force, the weak interaction, so there's a lot of stuff going on in the nucleus which we just won't get into in this video. The important thing is to be able to look at a nuclear equation, recognize it as beta decay, and be able to write everything in your nuclear equation. Let's do one more type of decay. This is gamma decay. Gamma rays are given off, and a gamma ray has no charge and no mass; it's pretty much just energy, if you think about it. These are pretty easy decay problems. Let's start with technetium-99m, and the m right here stands for metastable, which means a nucleus in its excited state, so a nucleus in its excited state, so it has more energy. It's going to give off a gamma ray, so let's go ahead and draw in our gamma ray here, so zero and zero. Since we're dealing with zeroes, so these zeroes aren't going to affect our numbers, so if we start with nucleons, we have 99 nucleons on the left, we're going to have 99 nucleons on the right. And in terms of charges, we have 43 positive charges on the left, we need 43 positive charges on the right. And since the atomic number isn't changing, it's 43 on the left, it's 43 on the right, we're dealing with technetium here. It's still technetium; it's just in the ground stage. It's no longer in the excited state. It's in the ground state. It's given off energy in the form of gamma rays in this example here. So technetium-99m is actually used in several medical imaging and diagnostic procedures, because we have ways of measuring the gamma radiation, and so this is very useful in medicine.",science_in-in-class-12th-physics-india_nuclei
" -  Let's think about the infinite series, so we're going to go from n equals one to infinity, of one over two to the n plus n. And what I want to do is see if we can prove whether this thing converges or diverges. And as you can imagine based on the context of where this video shows up on Khan Academy that maybe we will do it using the comparison test. At any point if you feel like you can kinda take this to the finish line, feel free to pause the video and do so. So in order to kind of figure out or get a sense for this series right over here, it never hurts to kind of expand it out a little bit, so let's do that. So this would be equal to when n equals one this is gonna be one over two to the one plus one, so it's gonna be one over two plus one, it's gonna be one third plus that's n equals one. When n equals two it's gonna be one over two squared, which is four plus two plus one over six. Plus let's see we go to three, n equals one, n equals two, n equals three is gonna be one over two to the third, which is eight plus three is 11. So one over 11, maybe I'll do one more term. Two the fourth power is going to be 16 plus four is 20. Plus one over 20 and obviously we just keep going on and on and on. So it looks, it feels like this thing could converge. All of our terms are positive, but they are getting smaller and smaller quite fast. And if we really look at the behavior of the terms as n gets larger and larger, we see that the two to the n in the denominator will grow much, much faster than the n will. So this kind of behaves like one over two to the n, which is a clue of something that we might be able to use for the comparison test. So let me just write that down. So we have one over, so the infinite series from n equals one to infinity of one over two to the n, and so when n equals one this is going to be equal to one half. When n is equal to two this is going to be equal to one fourth. When n is equal to three this is equal to one eighth. When n is equal to four this is equal to one sixteenth. And we go on and on and on and on. And what's interesting about this is we recognize it. This is a geometric series, so let me be clear. This thing right over here, that is the same thing as the sum of from n equals one to infinity of one half to the n power, just writing it in a different way. And since the absolute value of one half, which is just one half, so because the absolute value of one half is less than one we know that this geometric series converges, we know that it converges And actually we even have formulas for finding the exact sum of or to figure out what it converges to. And so we know this thing converges and we see that actually these two series combined meet all of the constraints we need for the comparison test. So let's go back to what we wrote about the comparison test. So the comparison test, we have two series, all of their terms are greater than or equal to zero. All of these terms are greater than or equal to zero. And then for the corresponding terms in one series, all of them are going to be less than or equal to the corresponding terms in the next one. And so if we look over here, we can consider this one, the magenta series, this is kind of our infinite series of dealing with A sub n and that this right over here is, well I already did it in blue this is kind of the blue series. And notice all their terms are nonnegative and the corresponding terms one half is greater than one third, one fourth is greater than one sixth, one eighth is greater than one eleventh. One over two to the n is always going to be greater than one over two to the n plus n for the n that we care about here. And since we know that this converges, since we know that the larger one converges. It's a geometric series where the common ratio the absolute value of the common ratio is less than one, since we know that the larger series converges therefore, the smaller series or the one where every corresponding term is less than the one in the blue one, that one must also converge. So by the comparison test the series in question must also converge.",math_calculus-all-old_series-calc
" Graph the inequality y minus 4x is less than negative 3. So the first thing we could do is we could kind of put this in mx plus b form, or slope-intercept form, but as an inequality. So we're starting with y minus 4x is less than negative 3. We can add 4x to both sides of this inequality. So let's add 4x to both sides of this inequality, and then we'll just have a y on the left-hand side. These guys cancel out. So you have y is less than 4x minus 3. We could have had negative 3 plus 4x, but we want to write the 4x first just because that's a form that we're more familiar with. So it's less than 4x minus 3. And now we can attempt to graph it. But before I graph it, I want to be a little bit careful here. So let me draw our axes. So this is the x-axis, and is that is the y-axis. And we want to be careful, because this says y is less than 4x minus 3, not less than or equal to 4x minus 3, or not y is equal to 4x minus 3. So what we want to do is kind of create a boundary at y is equal to 4x minus 3, and the solution to this inequality will be all of the area below that, all of the y values less than that. So let's try to do it. So the boundary line would look like-- so let me write it over here-- so we have a boundary at y is equal to 4x minus 3. Notice this isn't part of the solution. This isn't less than or equal. It's just less than. But this will at least help us draw, essentially, the boundary. So we could do it two ways. If you know slope and y-intercept, you know that 4 is our slope and that negative 3 is our y-intercept. Or you can literally just take two points, and that'll help you define a line here. So you could say, well, when x is equal to 0, what is y? You get 4 times 0 minus 3, you get y is equal to negative 3. And we knew that because it was the y-intercept. So you have 0, and then you have 1, 2, 0, and negative 3. And then you have the point, let's say, when x is equal to-- I don't know-- let's say when x is equal to 2. When x is equal to 2, what is y? We have 4 times 2 is 8 minus 3, y is then going to be equal to 5. So then you go 1, 2, and you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And so you have that point there as well. And then we can just connect the dots. Or you could say, look, there's a slope of 4. So every time we move over 1, every time we move 1 in the x direction, we move up 4 in the y direction. So we could draw it like that. So the line will look something like this. And I'm just going to draw it in a dotted line because, remember, this isn't part of the solution. Actually, let me draw it a little bit neater because that point should be right about there, and this point should be right about there. And then this boundary line I'm going to draw as a dotted line. So it's going to look something like that. I draw it a dotted line to show that it's not part of the solution. Our solution has the y's less than that. So for any x, so you pick an x here, if you took 4x minus 3, you're going to end up on the line. But we don't want the y's that are equal to that line. We want for that particular x, the y's that are less than the line. So it's going to be all of this area over here. We're less than the line, and we're not including the line, and that's why I put a dotted line here. You can also try values out. You can say, well, this line is dividing our coordinate axes into, essentially, the region above it and the region below it, and you can test it out. Let's take something that's above it. Let's take the point 0, 0 and see if that satisfies our inequality. If we have y is 0 is less than 0 minus 3, or we get 0 is less than negative 3. This is definitely not the case. This is not true. And it makes sense because that 0, 0 is not part of the solution. Now, we could go on the other side of our boundary line. And we could take the point, I don't know, let's take the point 3 comma 0. So let's say that this is the point-- well, that's right. There's a point 2 comma 0. Let's take the point 3 comma 0 right over here. This should work because it's in the region less than. But let's verify it for ourselves. So we have y is 0. 0 is less than 4 times 3 minus 3. 0 is less than 12 minus 3. 0 Is less than 9, which is definitely true. So that point does satisfy the inequality. So in general, you want to kind of look at this as an equal to draw the boundary line. We did it. But we drew it as a dotted line because we don't want to include it because this isn't less than or equal to. It's just less than. And then our solution to the inequality will be the region below it, all the y's less than the line for x minus 3.",math_in-in-grade-11-ncert_in-in-class11-linear-inequalities
" -  The geometric sequence a sub i, is defined by the formula where the first term, a sub one is equal to negative 1/8, and then every term after that is defined as being, so a sub i is going to be two times the term before that. A sub i is two times a sub i, minus one. What is a sub four, the fourth term in the sequence? Pause the video, and see if you can work this out. Well there's a couple of ways that you could tackle this. One is to just directly use these formulas. We could say that a sub four, well that's going to be this case right over here. A sub four is going to be equal to two times a sub three. Well, a sub three, if we go and use this formula, is going to be equal to two times a sub two. Each term is equal to two times the term before it. Then we go back to this formula again, and say a sub two is going to be two times a sub one. Two times a sub one. Lucky for us, we know that a sub one is negative 1/8. It's going to be two times negative 1/8, which is equal to negative 1/4. Negative 1/4. So this is negative 1/4. Two times negative 1/4, is equal to negative 2/4, or negative 1/2. A sub four is two times a sub three. A sub three is negative 1/2. So this is going to be two times negative 1/2, which is going to be equal to negative one. So that's one way to solve it. Another way to think about it is, look, we have our initial term. We also know our common ratio. We know each successive term is two times the term before it. So we could explicitly, this is a recursive definition for our geometric series. We could explicitly write it as a sub i is going to be equal to our initial term negative 1/8. Then we're going to multiply it by two. We're going to multiply it by two, i minus one times. So we could say times two, to the i minus oneth power. Let's make sure that makes sense. A sub one, based on this formula, a sub one would be negative 1/8, times two to the one minus one. Two to the zeroeth power. So that makes sense. That would be negative 1/8. Based on this formula, a sub two would be negative 1/8, times two to the two minus one. So two to the first power. We're going to take our initial term, and multiply it by two, once. Which is exactly right. A sub two is negative 1/4. So we want to find the fourth term in the sequence, we could just say well, using this explicit formula, we could say a sub four, is equal to negative 1/8, times two to the four, minus one. Two to the four, minus one power. So this is equal to negative 1/8, times two to the third power. This is negative 1/8 times eight. Negative 1/8 times eight, which is equal to negative one. You might be a little bit, a toss up on which method you want to use, but for sure this second method, right over here where we'd come up with an explicit formula once we know the initial term, and we know the common ratio, this would be way easier, if you were trying to find say, the 40th term. Because doing the 40th term recurs to be like this, would take a lot of time, and frankly, a lot of paper.",math_algebra_sequences
" -  ""Goku wants to get over 9000 comments ""on his YouTube videos. ""He gets to the same number of comments ""for each cat video that he uploads, ""and he gets the same number of comments ""for each dog video that he uploads."" That's somewhat amazing. The exact same number of comments for each cat video and the exact same number for each dog video. But we'll just assume what they're telling us. ""In the following inequality, C represents ""the number of cat videos, C for cat, ""and D represents the number of dog videos, ""D for dog, dog videos that Goku should upload ""to achieve his goal."" So 750 times the number of cat videos plus 450 times the number of dog videos needs to be greater than 9000. ""According to the inequality, ""how many comments does each cat video get ""and how many comments does each dog video get?"" So let's see if we understand what's going over here, what's going on in this inequality to answer their question. So he wants to get over 9000 comments and we see that right over here. He wants to get over 9000 comments. So this we could view as a number of comments that he actually gets. Since we have some number times C, we can assume that, well C, well we know that C is a number of cat videos and so the number times C, that's the number of comments that he gets from cat videos. And on a per cat video bases, he's going to get 750 comments. Because if I say, ""Hey, look. ""I have C cat videos and on each of them, ""I have exactly 750 comments."" Well, I'm gonna have 750 times C comments on all of my cat videos combined. So each cat video gets 750 comments. And similarly, I can never say that, each dog video gets, well this is the total number of comments from dog videos. You add all of these together. Your total number of comments w to be greater than 9000. Well, if the total from dog videos is 450 D, then we see he's getting 450 comments per dog video. 450 comments per video times the number of dog videos gets the total comments from dog videos. So he gets 450 comments per dog video. ""Can Goku achieve this goal by uploading eight cat videos ""and seven dog videos?"" So let's think about this. Eight cat videos, seven dog videos. So let's see. If we have 750, let me do those in same colors, if we have 750 times eight, times eight plus 450 times seven, is this greater than, I'm writing the question mark so we don't know, is this going to be greater than 9000? Well, we just have to evaluate this. What is this going to be? Let's see. 700 times eight is 5600. It's going to be 5600 plus another 50 times eight is 400. So 5600 plus 400 is 60 hundred or 6000. So this is 6000 right over here. So that would be, if he has eight cat videos, he gets 750 comments per video so he's going to have a total of 6000 comments on all of the eight cat videos combined. And then 450 times seven, let's see, 400 times seven is 2800 plus another 30, plus another 350, that's going to be, what? 3150, is that right? Let's see, that would be, let me show you to this right, 2800 plus 400 times seven is 2800. 50 times seven is 350. Yep, I think that is right. It all, all works out, 3150. So 6000 plus 3150 is indeed greater than 9000. It is indeed greater than 9000. This over here is 9150 which is indeed greater than 9000. So yes, he can achieve his goal by uploading eight cat videos and seven dog videos.",math_algebra_inequalities-systems-graphs
" Last video, we saw what happens when we have resistors in series. Now let's see what happens when we have resistors in parallel. All right, let me pick a new color. New color will be magenta. There's my battery: positive, negative. There's my ideal conducting wire. Here's my ideal conducting wire, but then-- and this is new-- it branches off, and I have two resistances. I have one here. And that's another resistance. And let's say that this has a resistance R1, this has a resistance R2. And, of course, the non-intuitive convention is that the current flows from the positive to the negative terminal, but we know that the electrons are actually flowing in the other direction. And I want to keep saying that, because I think it's so important to understand what's actually happening as opposed to the convention. Well, anyway, in the previous video, we said, well, when we have devices or components in series, that the current through the entire circuit is constant. But let's think about what happens here. So we have these electrons-- actually, let's think about it from the electron flow. The electrons are flowing, flowing, flowing at a given rate, and then here they have a choice. Some of them can take this top path, some of them can take this bottom path. So if you think about it, the flow of electrons in this branch plus the flow of electrons in that branch have to add up to the flow of the electrons in this branch, right? And then they're going to meet back up, and then the flow of electrons here-- so if we think of it this way, and now I'm going to go back to the convention, this is I1. So you have these electrons flowing at a given rate. This is the current right here. They're going to branch off, and maybe half of them go-- we'll see if the resistances are equal, if both of these branches have an equal amount of capacity in terms of how fast the electrons can flow through. If they're equal, or since we're going to current in this direction, let's talk about positrons or positive charges. If the positive charges-- although I just want to keep saying that it is not the positive charges that are moving. It's the electrons. But if you say that the lack of electrons can flow equally easily between both paths, that's if the resistances were the same, we could imagine that the current, the flow, would split itself up, and then over here would meet back up. And then we would say that the current here would also be I1. But let's figure out where the current's going. Let's call this current I2 and let's call this current I3. So I think it is reasonable, and you can imagine with water pipes or anything, that the current going into the branch is equal to the current exiting the branch. Or you could even think of it that the current entering-- when the currents I2 and I1 merge, that they combine and they become Current 1, right? I mean, think about it. In a given second, if this is 5 coulombs per second-- I'm just making up numbers-- and this is 6 coulombs per second, in a given second right here, you're going to have 5 coulombs coming from this branch and 6 coulombs coming from this branch, so you're going to have 11 coulombs per second coming out once they've merged, so this would be 11 coulombs per second. So I think hopefully that makes sense to you that this current is equal to the combination of this current and that current. Now, what do we also know? We also know the voltage along this entire ideal wire is constant, so then voltage-- let me draw that in another color, in blue. So, for example, the voltage anywhere along this blue that I'm filling in is going to be the same, because this wire is an ideal conductor, and you can almost view this blue part as an extension of the positive terminal of the battery. And very similarly-- I'll do it in yellow-- we could draw this wire as an extension of the negative terminal of the battery. This is an extension of the negative terminal of the battery. So the voltage difference between here and here-- so let's call that the total voltage, or let's just call it the voltage, right? The voltage difference between that point and that point is the exact same thing as the voltage difference between this point and this point, which is the exact same thing as the voltage difference between this point and this point. So what can we say? What is the total current in the system? If we just viewed this as a black box, that this is some type of total resistance, well, the total current in the system would be the total voltage, the voltage divided by-- let's call this our total resistance, right? Let's say we couldn't see this and we just said, oh, that's just some total resistance, and that is equal to the current going through R1. This is I1. This is a 1 right here. This is current I1. What's current I1? Well, it's going to be the voltage across this resistor divided by the resistance, right? That's what Ohm's law tells us: V is equal to IR, or another way we could say it is V over R is equal to I, right? So I1 is equal to the voltage across this resistor, but we just said that voltage is the same thing as this voltage, right? The voltage here is the same thing as the voltage here. The voltage here is the same thing as the voltage here. So the voltage across that resistor is still V, and so the current flowing across that resistor is V over R1. And the same logic: what is I2? I2 is this current. What is the voltage across this device? Well, that's just V again, right? It's the same thing as the voltage across this device, so it's V over R2 by Ohm's law. Well, all these V's are the same, so we can divide both sides of that equation by V, and we get 1 over the total resistance is equal to 1 over R1 plus 1 over R2. And you could make that argument if we had an R3 here. Let's say that we had another device, and that is R3. You could use the exact same argument, and you would have a plus 1 over R3. And if you had Rn or 10 of them, you'd just keep that 1 over R4, R5, et cetera. So let's see if we can use this information we have learned to actually solve a problem, and I actually find that it's always easier to solve a problem than to explain the theory behind a problem. You'll see that with most of these circuit problems, it's actually very basic mathematics. So let's say I have a 16 volt battery plus, minus, it's 16 volts. And just to hit the point home that you always don't have to draw circuits the same, although it is nice if you're actually drawing complicated circuits, I could draw it like this. I could draw the circuit like this, and let's say that there's a resistor here. And then let's say there's a wire and then there's another resistor here, and that this decides to do some random loopy thing here and that they connect here, and that they come back here. This strange thing that I have drawn, which you will never see in any textbook, because most people are more reasonable than me, is the exact same-- you can almost view it topologically as the exact same circuit as what I drew in the previous diagram, although now I will assign numbers to it. Let's say that this resistance is 20 ohms and let's say that this resistance is 5 ohms. What I want to know is, what is the current through the system? First, we'll have to figure out what the equivalent resistance is, and then we could just use Ohm's law to figure out the current in the system. So we want to know what the current is, and we know that the convention is that current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. So how do we figure out the equivalent resistance? Well, we know that we just hopefully proved to you that the total resistance is equal to 1 over this resistor plus 1 over this resistor. So 1 over-- I won't keep writing it. What's 1 over 20? Well, actually, let's just make it a fraction. So it's 1/20 plus-- 1/5 is what over 20? That's 4/20, right? So 1 over our total resistance is equal to 5/20, which is equal to what? 1/4. So if 1/R is equal to 1/4, R must be equal to 4. R is equal to 4 ohms. So we could redraw this crazy circuit as this. I'll try to draw it small down here. We could redraw this where this resistance is 4 ohms and this is 16 volts. We could say that this whole thing combined is really just a resistor that is 4 ohms. Well, if we have a 16-volt potential difference, current is flowing that way, even though that's not what the electrons are doing. And that's what our resistance is, 4 ohms. What is the current? 1V equals IR, Ohms law. 1The voltage is 16 volts. 1It equals the current times 4 ohms. So current is equal to 116 divided by 4, is equal to 4 amps. 1So let's do something interesting. 1Let's figure out what the current is flowing through. 1What's this? 1What's the current I1 and what's this current I2? 1Well, we know that the potential difference from here 1to here is also 16 volts, right? 1Because this whole thing is essentially at the same 1potential and this whole thing is essentially at the same 1potential, so you have 16 volts across there. 116 volts divided by 20 ohms, so let's call this I1. 1So I1 is equal to 16 volts divided by 20 ohms, which is 1equal to what? 14/5. 1So it equals 4/5 of an ampere, or 0.8 amperes. 1And similarly, what is the amount of current flowing 1through here? 1I2? 1I'm going to do this in a different color. 1It's getting confusing. 1I'll do it in the vibrant yellow. 1So the current flowing through here, once again, the 1potential difference from here-- that's not different 1enough-- the potential difference from here to here 1is also 16 volts, right? 1So the current is going to be I2, is going to be equal to 116/5, which is equal to 3 1/5 amps. 1So most of the current is actually flowing through this, 1and that makes sense because the resistance is less, right? 1So that should hopefully give you a little bit of intuition 1of what's going on. 1And less current is flowing through here, so I2 through 1the 20-ohm resistor is 0.8 amps is I1, and I2 through the 15-ohm resistor is equal to 3.2 amps. 1And it makes sense that when you add these two currents 1together, the 3.2 amperes flowing through here and the 10.8 amperes flowing through here, that when they merge, 1they merge and then you have 4 amperes flowing through there. 1Anyway, hopefully, I have given you some intuition on 1what happens when we put resistors in parallel. 1I will see you in the next video.",science_physics_circuits-topic
" -  Let f of x equal negative x squared plus a x plus b over x squared plus c x plus d where a, b, c, and d are unknown constants. Which of the following is a possible graph of y is equal to f of x? And they told us dashed lines indicate asymptotes. So this is really interesting here. And they gave us four choices. We see four of them, three of them right now. Then if I scroll over bit over, you can see choice D. And so I encourage you to pause the video and think about how we can figure it out because it is interesting because they haven't given us a lot of details. They haven't given us what these coefficients or these constants are going to be. All right, now let's think about it. So one thing we could think about is horizontal asymptotes. So let's think about what happens as x approaches positive or negative infinity. Well, as x, so as x approaches infinity or x approaches negative infinity, f of x. F of x is going to be approximately equal to. Well, we're going to look at the highest degree terms because these are going to dominate as the magnitude of x, the absolute value of x becomes very large. So f of x is going to be approximately negative x squared over x squared which is equal to negative or we could another way to think about it. This is the same thing as negative one. So f of x is going to approach, f of x is going to approach negative one. In either direction, as x approaches infinity or x approaches negative infinity. So we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals negative one. Let's see, choice A here, it does look like they have a horizontal asymptote at y is equal to negative one right over there. And we can verify that because each hash mark is two. We go from two to zero to negative two to negative four. So this does look like it's a negative one. So just based only on the horizontal asymptote, choice A looks good. Choice B, we have a horizontal asymptote at y is equal to positive two. So we can rule that out. We know that a horizontal asymptote as x approaches positive or negative infinity is at negative one, y equals negative one. Here, our horizontal asymptote is at y is equal to zero. The graph approaches, it approaches the x axis from either above or below. So it's not the horizontal asymptote. It's not y equals negative one. So we can rule that one out. And then similarly, over here, our horizontal asymptote is not y equals negative one. Our horizontal asymptote is y is equal to zero so we can rule that one out. And that makes sense because really they only gave us enough information to figure out the horizontal asymptote. They didn't give us enough information to figure out how many roots or what happens in the interval and all of those types of things. How many zeros and all that because we don't know what the actual coefficients or constants of the quadratic are. All we know is what happens as the x squared terms dominate. This thing is going to approach negative one. And so we picked choice A.",math_algebra2_rational
" -  Hello everyone. So I'm talking about how to find the tangent plane to a graph. And I think the first step of that is to just figure out how we control planes in three dimensions in the first place. So what I have pictured here is a red dot representing a point in three dimensions, and the coordinates of that point, easily enough are one two three. So the x coordinate is one, the y coordinate's two and the z coordinate is three. And then I have a plane that passes through it. And the goal of the video is going to be to find a function, a function that I'll call l, that takes in a two dimensional input x and y and this function l should have this plane as it's graph. Now the first thing to notice is that there's lots of different planes that could be passing through this point, right? At the moment it's one that's got a certain kind of angle, you could think of it going up in one direction, but you could give this a lot of different directions, and get a lot of different planes, that all pass through that one point. So we're going to need to find some way of distinguishing the specific one that we're looking at, which is this one right here, from other possible planes that can pass through it. And as we work through you'll see how this is done in terms of partial derivatives. But as we are getting our head around what the formula for this graph can be, let's just start observing properties that it has. The first property is that the graph actually passes through this point, one, two, three. And what that means in terms of functions over here, is that if you evaluated at the point one two, the input pair where both x is one and y is two, then it should equal three. It should equal three because that's telling you that when you go x equals one and y equals two and then you say what's the height of the graph above that point, it should be the z coordinate at the end of the desired point. So this right here is the fact number one, that we can take into consideration. And beyond that, let's start thinking about what makes planes, what makes these kind of flat graphs, different from the sort of curvy graphs that you might be used to in other multi-variable function. The main idea is that if you intersect it with another plane, so here I'm going to intersect it with y equals two, this kind of constant plane, and so I'll go ahead and write that down. That plane that you're looking at, is y equals two. And you can think of this as representing, what is movement in the x direction look like. As we move along the x direction, this kind of has a slope. The two planes intersect along a line, and that's one of the crucial features of a plane, is that if you intersect it with another plane, you just get a straight line, meaning the slope is constant, as you move in the x direction. But it's also constant, that same slope, if you move in the y direction. If I had chosen a different plane. If instead I had chosen y equals one, which looks like this, then you get a line with the same slope. And no matter what constant value of y you choose, it's always intersecting that plane, with a line that has the same slope. And now if you look back to the videos on partial derivatives, and in particular on how you interpret the partial derivative of a function, with respect to it's graph, what this is telling you is that when we take the partial derivative of l with respect to x, because constant y means you are moving in the x direction, this should just be some kind of constant. Some kind of constant a. I'll kind of emphasize that that is a constant value here. And the same goes in the other direction, right. Let's say instead of intersecting it with constant values of y, we say well what if you intersected it with a constant value of x, like x equals one. Well in that case what you should get, 'cos you're intersecting it with a plane, is another straight line, so these two planes are intersecting along a straight line, which means as you move in the y direction, this slope won't change. But also as you move in the x direction, if you imaginee slicing it with a bunch of different planes, all representing different constant values of x, you would be getting a line with that same slope. And that's telling you another powerful fact. The partial derivative of l, with respect to y, now if you're moving in the y direction, that's equal to some other constant, that I'm going to call b. And now, keep in mind, these are very powerful statements, because the partial derivative of l with respect to x is a function, this is a function of x and y, and that might actually be worth emphasizing here, that the partial derivative of x with respect to y is something that you evaluate at a point in two dimensional space. And we're saying that that's equal to some kind of constant value. Now that's a pretty powerful thing right? Because it's telling you, it's giving you control over the function at all possible input points, for movement in a specified direction. And the same goes over here. This is telling you that. A function is constantly equal to some value b, and we're not sure what this value b is. But just geometrically we can estimate what these things should be. So if I take back the plane representing a constant y value, and we say what's the slope, you're moving in the x direction, we've got a constant y value, what is the slope at which this plane intersects our graph? I would estimate this as about the slope of two. You know you go over one and it goes up two. So what that would tell you is that, at least in the specific graph we're looking at, this is at least approximately equal to two. And then similarly if we look at constant x value, and we say that represents movement in the y direction, what is the slope there. This looks to me like about one, as a slope. You kind of move over one unit you go up one unit. So I'd say down here that the constant value of the partial derivative with respect to y is about equal to one. So we have three different facts here, the value of the function at the point of one two, the value of its partial derivative with respect to x everywhere, and the partial derivative with respect to y, everywhere. And this information is actually going to be enough to tell us what the function as a whole should equal. Now specifically, this idea that the partial derivative with respect to x is constant, tells us that the function l of xy is going to equal two times x plus something that doesn't have any x's in it, something that as far as x is concerned is constant, because the only thing whose derivative, with respect to x, is the constant two is two x plus something that's constant, as far as x is concerned. And then similarly over here, if the partial with respect to y is the constant one, then that tells you that the whole function looks like this looks like a constant as far as y is concerned. So once we bring in y, it's going to be one times y plus something that's constant, as far as y is concerned. You know this part is already constant, as far as y is concerned, so anything that I add beyond here has to be constant as far as both x and y is concerned. So that part has to actually literally be a constant. So I'm just going to put in c for that, to represent constant. So, you can see this is a very restricted property on our function, because the only place x can show up is this linear term and the only place y can show up is as this linear term. And when I use the word linear, you can pretty much interpret as saying the term x shows up without an exponent or without anything fancy happening to it. It's just x times a constant, that's pretty much what I mean by linear. It's got more precise formulations in other contexts, but as far as we're concerned here, you can just think of it as meaning variable times a constant. So the question is what should this c be. And you can imagine that we can, based on this property, based on the value at the point one two, we can uniquely determine c. And you can plug in, x equals one, y equals two, know that this has to equal three and solve for c. Which we could do but I'm going to actually do something a little bit more convenient. I'm going to kind of shift around where the constants show up, and I'm going to say that the whole function should equal two times and then I'm going to put a constant in with the x, I'm going to say x minus one, and then I'm going to do the same thing with y, and I'm going to say plus one, here is the partial derivative with respect to y, y minus and then I'm going to say two. And the reason I'm doing this, notice this doesn't change the partial derivative information, it's just if we take the partial derivative with respect to x, this will still be two, and when we take it with respect to y, this will still be one. But the reason I'm putting these in here, is because we're gonna evaluate it at the point one two so I want to make it look as easy as possible to evaluate at the point one two. And then from here I'm just going to add another constant, so instead of saying c because this is going to be slightly different from c, I'll call it k. But the idea is that I'm just moving around constants. If you imagined distributing the multiplication here, and having two times that negative one, and one times that negative two, you're just changing what the value of the constant stuck on the end here is. Now the important part, the reason that I'm writing it this way, which is only slightly different, is because then when I evaluate this, at l of one two, this whole first part, cancels out because plugging in x equals one means this whole part goes to zero. Same with the second part, because when I plug in y equals two, this part goes to zero. So k this other constant, that I'm tagging on the end, is going to completely specify what happens when I evaluate this at the point one two. And of course I want it to be the case, when I evaluate at one two I get three. I want it to be the case when I evaluate at one two, I get three. So that tells me, that this constant k here should just equal 3. So notice the way that I've written the function here, is actually quite powerful. We have a lot of control. This term two was telling us the slope with respect to x. So when you moved purely in the x direction, and that was kind of illustrated here, purely in the x direction, that's telling us the slope with respect to x, and then this term one here, was telling us the slope with respect to y. So when we moved purely in the y direction, that's telling us the slope there. And we could just turn those knobs if we change the two and we change the one, that's what's going to allow us to basically change what the slopes of the plane are. I'm going to say slopes plural because it's with respect to the x and the y direction. And that will give us control of various different planes that pass through. If I'm looking at the one right here, then the movement in the y direction is very shallow, so that would be turning this knob lower, and instead of one it might be point zero one. And if I were looking at movement in the x direction, 1you know this looks actually negative. 1So this would tell you that it's going to be 1some kind of negative number. 1So you can kind of dial these knobs and that changes 1the different planes that pass through that same point. 1And then, plugging in this one two and three, 1tells us what point we're specifying. 1We're basically saying when you input x equals one, 1and you input y equals 2, 1the whole thing should equal three. 1So this form right here's is powerful enough that 1I want you to remember it for the next video. 1I want you to remember the idea of writing things down 1in this way where you specify 1the point its passing through 1with it's x coordinate y coordinate and z coordinate, 1placed where they are, 1and then you tweak the slopes, using these coefficients 1out front. 1So with that, I will see you next video.",math_multivariable-calculus_applications-of-multivariable-derivatives
" Welcome back. In the last video, I told you that pressure times volume is a constant. That if you increase the pressure-- or if you increase the volume, you're going to decrease the pressure. Hopefully, you got an intuitive sense why. Or likewise, if you squeezed the balloon, or the box, and there are no openings there, then the pressure within the box would increase. With that said, let's see if we can do a couple of fairly typical problems that you'll see. So let's say that I have a box, or a balloon, or something, and it has a volume, and so let me call this the initial volume. My initial volume is 50 cubic meters, and my initial pressure is 500 pascals. Just so you remember, what's a pascal? That's 500 newtons per meter cubed. I take that box, or balloon, or whatever, and I compress it down to 20 meters cubed. So I compress it, so I squeeze it-- that was the first example that I gave last time. It was the same container, and I squeeze it down to 20 meters cubed. What's going to be the new pressure? You should immediately have an intuition-- what happens when you squeeze a balloon? It becomes harder to do it. What's going to be the new pressure? It's definitely going to be higher-- when you decrease the volume, the pressure increases are inversely related. The pressure's going to go up, and let's see if we can calculate it. We know that P1 times v1 is equal to some constant, and since we have no aggregate change in energy-- I'm just telling you that the box is squeezed, I'm not telling you whether it did any work, or anything like that-- the same constant is going to be equal to the new pressure times the new volume, which is equal to P2 times V2. You could just have the general relationship: P1 times V1 is equal to P2 times V2, assuming that no work was done, and there was no exchange of energy from outside of the system. In most of these cases, when you see this on an exam, that is the case. The old pressure was 500 pascals times 50 meters cubed. One thing to keep in mind, because this equivalence is not equal, and we're not saying it has to equal some necessary absolute number-- for example, we don't know exactly what this K is, although we could figure it out right now-- as long as you're using one unit for pressure on this side, and one unit for volume on this side, you just have to use the same units. We could have done this same exact problem the exact same way, if instead of meters cubed, they said liters, as long as we had liters here. You just have to make sure you're using the same units on both sides. In this case, we have 500 pascals as the pressure, and the volume is 50 meters cubed. That's going to be equal to the new pressure, P2, times the new volume, 20 meters cubed. Let's see what we can do: we can divide both sides by 10, so we can take the 10 out of there, and we could divide both sides by 2, so that becomes a 250. We we get 250 times 5 is equal to P2, and so P2 is equal to 1250 pascals, and if we kept with the units, you would have seen that. When I decreased the volume by roughly 60%, I have the pressure actually increased by 2 1/2, so that gels with what we talked about before. Let's add another variable into this mix-- let's talk about temperature. Like pressure, volume, work, and a lot of concepts that we talk about in physics, temperature is something that you probably are at least reasonably familiar with. How do you view temperature? A high temperature means something is hot, and a low temperature means something is cold, and I think that also gives you intuition that a higher temperature object has more energy. The sun has more energy than an ice cube-- I think that's fair enough. I think you also have the sense that-- what would have more energy? A 100 degree cup of tea, or a 100 degree barrel of tea. I want to make them equivalent in terms of what they're holding. I think you have a sense. Even though they're the same temperature, they're both pretty warm-- let's say this is 100 degrees Celsius, so they're both boiling-- that the barrel, because there's more of it, is going to have more energy. It's equally hot, and there's just more molecules there. That's what temperature is. Temperature, in general, is a measure roughly equal to some constant times the kinetic energy-- the average kinetic energy-- per molecule. So the average kinetic energy of the system divided by the total number of molecules we have. Another way we could talk about is, temperature is essentially energy per molecule. So something that has a lot of molecules, where N is the number of molecules. Another way we could view this is that the kinetic energy of the system is going to be equal to the number of molecules times the temperature. This is just a constant-- times 1 over K, but we don't even know what this is, so we could say that's still a constant-- so the kinetic energy of the system is going to be equal to some constant times the number of particles times temperature. We don't know what this is, and we're going to figure this out later. This is another interesting concept. We said that pressure times volume is proportional to the kinetic energy of the system-- the aggregate, if you take all of the molecules and combine their kinetic energies. These aren't the same K's-- I could put another constant here and call that K1. And we also know that the kinetic energy of the system is equal to some other constant times the number of molecules I have times the temperature. If you think about it, you could also say that this is proportional to this, and this is proportional to this. You could say that pressure times volume is proportional to the number-- and these are all different proportional constants, and we'll figure out this exact constant later-- so we could say that pressure times volume is proportional to molecules we have, times temperature. And we said that we can view temperature as energy per molecule. Another way we could say is that if this constant is constant, which is by definition, and the number of molecules is constant-- we have PV over temperature. Pressure times volume over temperature is going to be equal to something times the number of molecules, so we could say that's some other constant, like k4. This is another interesting thing to think about: we said pressure times volume is equal to pressure times volume, and now we added temperature into the mix. We could say P1 times V1 over T1 is equal to P2 times V2 over T2. Does this make sense to you? What happens if I have another box, and I have my particles bouncing around like always. I have some volume, and some amount of pressure-- what happens when the temperature goes up? What am I saying? I'm saying that the average kinetic energy per molecule is going to go up, so they're going to bounce against the walls more. If they bounce against the walls more, the pressure's going to go up, assuming volume stays flat. Another way you could think about it-- let's say the temperature goes up, and the pressure stays flat. So what did I have to do? I just said if the temperature goes up, the average kinetic energy of each molecule-- they'll bounce more. In order to make them bounce against the sides of the walls 1as often, I'd have to increase the volume. 1If you hold pressure constant, the only way you can do that 1is by increasing the volume while you increase the 1temperature. 1Let's keep this in mind, and we will use this to solve some 1pretty typical problems in the next video.",science_physics_thermodynamics

" Mr. Theisen is honing his deadly three-point precision on the basketball court. For one of his shots, the height of the ball in feet as a function of horizontal distance, in feet, y of x-- so here y is a function of x. So the height must be y because that's the thing that is a function of something else. So this right over here is height. So our y-axis is going to represent height. And it is a function of x. So x must represent horizontal distance because height is a function of horizontal distance. So this right over here is horizontal distance. Now, it's plotted below. Mr Theisen is standing at x equals 0. So he's standing right over here. This is Mr. Theisen, as I draw my best attempt to draw a little stick figure version of Mr. Theisen. That's not even an acceptable stick figure right over there. So this is Mr. Theisen, and he's standing at x equals 0. And at x equals 0, he is shooting a basketball. And you see from the function right over here that where the graph intersects the y-axis, that tells us that's essentially the height of the ball when x is equal 0, where it's where Mr. Theisen is standing. And if we look at this, this looks like it's 2, 4, 6 feet high. So that's really the initial position of the ball when Mr. Theisen is about to let go of it. Then he lets go of it, and the ball goes in this parabolic trajectory. It increases, increases, increasing, increases. It looks like it hits a maximum point right around there, roughly. That looks like it's at about 16 feet. And then it starts to go down. And right over here-- and this looks like it's about, let's see, 22, 24, 26 feet out-- it looks like it hit something. And considering that something is 10 feet high, it's reasonable to assume that the thing that it hits is the goal. And especially because the question states that he has deadly three-point precision, we can assume it's not crazy that he actually makes the goal. And so that's where it goes into the net. And then the net forces the ball to go down at a much steeper trajectory. And this is exactly, of course, 10 feet high, the height of the goal. Now let's see which of these interpretations are consistent with the interpretation that we just did. The ball is released from Mr. Theisen's hand at a height of 6 feet. Well, that looks exactly right. When x is equal to 0, the ball is 6 feet. And not only is that right, but that is the significance of the y-intercept of this function. The y-intercept is the value of y, the height when x is equal to 0. So that is indeed the significance of the y-intercept. Let's look at these other things. Mr. Theisen is shooting the basketball from 26 feet away. Well, that's right. He's at x equals 0. The goal is at 26 feet away. But that's not the significance of the y-intercept. That would be the significance of where we saw this little point here where the ball dropped down at a steeper angle. The rim of the basketball hoop is 10 feet high. Once again, that's true. You can look at it. You can see it right over there. But that's not the significance of the y-intercept. The maximum height that the ball reaches is 16 feet. Well, once again, that is true, but that's the significance of this maximum point on the curve. That's not the significance of the y-intercept. So we'll go with this first choice.",math_math1_functions
"  In the last video, I touched on the idea of a sigma bond. And that was a bond-- well, let me draw two nucleuses and let me just draw one of the orbitals. Let's say this is an sp3 hybridized orbital, and that's on this atom and this is kind of this big lobe right there. And then this guy has an sp3 hybridized orbital as well. That's the small lobe, and then that's the big lobe like that. A sigma bond is one where there's an overlap kind of in the direction in which the lobes are pointed. And you might say, well, how can there be any other type of bond than that? Well, the other type of bond, so this right here-- let me make this clear. This right here is a sigma bond. And you say, well, what other kind of bond could there be where my two orbitals overlap kind of in the direction that they're pointing? And the other type of bond you could have, you can imagine if you have two p orbitals. So let me draw the nucleus of two atoms, and I'll just draw one of each of their p orbitals. So let's say that that's the nucleus and I'll just draw their p orbitals. So a p orbital is just that dumbbell shape. Let me draw them a little bit closer together. So a p orbital is that dumbbell shape. So let me draw this guy's-- one of his p orbitals. I want to draw it a little bit bigger than that, and you'll see why a second. So one of his p orbitals right there. It comes out like that. And then this guy over here also has a p orbital that is parallel to this p orbital, so it goes like that.  Let me draw that other one a little bit straighter. It goes-- I want it to overlap more, so it goes like that. I think you get the idea. So here, our two p orbitals are parallel to each other. This, you can imagine, these are sp3 hybridized orbitals. They're pointing at each other. Here, they're parallel. p orbitals are parallel to each other, and you see that they overlap on this kind of top lobe here and in this bottom lobe here. And this is a pi bond. Let me make this clear. And this is one pi bond. So you could call it a pi, literally, with the Greek letter pi: pi bond. Sometimes you'll see this just written as pi bond. And it's called a pi bond because it's the Greek letter for essentially p, and we're dealing with p orbitals overlapping. Now sigma bonds, which are what form when you have a single bond, these are stronger than pi bonds; pi bonds come into play once you start forming double or triple bonds on top of a sigma bond. To kind of get a better visualization of how that might work, let's think about ethene. So it's molecular structure looks like this. So you have C double-bonded to C, and then each of those guys have two hydrogens.  So let me draw what it would look like, or our best visual, or our best ability to kind of conceptualize what the orbitals around the carbon might look like.  So first I'll draw the sp2 hybridized orbitals. So let me just make it very clear what's going on here. So when we were dealing with methane, which is literally just a carbon bonded to four hydrogens, and if I actually wanted to draw it in a way that it kind of looks a little three-dimensional with a tetrahedral structure, it might look like this. This hydrogen is pointing out a little bit. This hydrogen is kind of in the plane of the page, and then maybe that hydrogen is behind it, and then you have one hydrogen popping up. That's methane. And we saw that these were all sp3 hybridized orbitals around the carbon, and then they each formed sigma bonds with each of the hydrogens. We saw that in the last video. And when we drew its electron configuration, in order for this to happen, carbon's electron configuration when bonding in methane needed to look like this. It needed to look like 1s2. And then instead of having 2s2 and then 2p2, what you essentially have is-- let me try it this way, actually, even better. Let me write this better. In 1s, you had two electrons, and then instead of two s's, you had two electrons and on each of the p's, you had one, the s's and the p's all got mixed up and you had a 2sp3 hybridized orbital, another 2sp3 hybridized orbital, another 2sp3 hybridized orbital, and then another one, sp3. Normally, when carbon's sitting by itself, you would expect a 2s here, and then you'd have a 2p in the x-direction, a 2p in the y-direction, and then a 2p in the z-direction. But we saw in the last video, they all get mixed up and they all have a 25% s-character, and a 75% p-character when carbon bonds in methane and the electrons kind of separate out in that situation. When you're dealing with the carbons in ethene, remember, eth- is for two carbons and ene-, because we're dealing with an alkene. We have a double bond here. In this situation, the carbon's electron configuration when they bond in ethene looks more like this. So you have your 1s, and the 1s orbital is still completely full. It has two electrons in it. But then in your 2 shell, I'll just write-- let me do this in a different color. So in our 2 shell, I'll show you what I mean in a second. I'm not writing the s or p's so far on purpose, but we're going to have four electrons just like we had before. We're still forming four bonds. We're going to have these four unpaired electrons. We're still forming one, two, three, four bonds with each of the carbons, so they're going to be separated out.  But in this situation, instead of all of them being a mixture, kind of one part s, three parts p, the s mixes with two of the p orbitals. So what you have is 2sp2 orbital. So you can imagine that the s orbital mixes with two of the p orbitals. So now it's one part s, two parts p. And then one of the p orbitals kind of stays by itself. And we need this p orbital to stay by itself because it is going to be what's responsible for the pi bond. And we're going to see that the pi bond does something very interesting to the molecule. It kind of makes it unrotatable around a bond axis. And you'll see what I mean in a second. So let me see if I can, in three dimensions, draw each of these carbons.  So you have-- let me do it a different color. You have this carbon right there. So let's say that's the nucleus. I'll put a C there so you know which carbon we're dealing with. And then I'll draw-- you could assume that the 1s orbital, it's really small right around the carbon. And then you have these hybridized orbitals, The 2sp2 orbitals, and they're all going to be planar, kind of forming a triangle, or I guess maybe a peace sign on some level, but I'll try to draw it in three dimensions here. So you have one, this is kind of coming out a little bit. Then you have one that's going in a little bit. And then you have-- and they have another lobe a little bit on the other side, but I'm not going to draw them. It'll complicate it. They still have characteristics of p, so they'll have two lobes, but one is bigger than the other. And then you have one that's maybe going in this side. So you can imagine that this is kind of a Mercedes sign if you drew a circle around it, on its side. So that's this carbon right here. And, of course, it has its hydrogens. So you have this hydrogen there. And so this hydrogen might be sitting right here. It just has one electron in its 1s orbital. You have this hydrogen up here. It's sitting right over there. And now let's draw this carbon.  This carbon will be sitting-- I'm drawing it pretty close together. This carbon will be sitting right there. He has his 1s orbital. They have the exact same electron configuration. He has his 1s orbital right around him, and then he has the exact same configuration. Either of these guys, we've so far only-- or in this first guy, I've only drawn these first three. I haven't drawn this unhybridized p orbital yet. So I'll do that in a second. But let me draw his bonds. So first of all, he has this, or you could imagine, that bond right there, which would be an sp2 hybridized bond. Let me do that in the same color. So he has this bond right here, which would be an sp2 hybridized bond, just like that. And notice, this is a sigma bond. They overlap in kind of the direction that they're pointing in. That's the best I could think about it. And then he's got these two hydrogens, so one-- he's got this guy in the back, and then there's one in the front. I'll draw it a little bigger so it's kind of pointing out at us, right? And then we have this hydrogen is sitting right over here. And these are also sigma bonds, just to be very clear about things. This is an s orbital overlapping with an sp2 orbital, but they're kind of overlapping in the direction that they're pointed, or kind of along the direction of each other, of the two atoms. This is a sigma bond, sigma bond, and then we have this hydrogen in the back, which is also 1going to form a sigma bond. 1So everything I've drawn so far is a sigma 1bond, so that, that. 1Maybe I don't want to make this picture too-- so I can 1just put sigma bond there, sigma bond there, sigma bond 1there, sigma, sigma. 1So far I've drawn this bond, this bond, this bond, this 1bond, and this bond, all of those sigma bonds. 1So, what happens to this last p orbital for 1each of these guys? 1Well, that's going to be kind of sticking out of the plane 1of the Mercedes sign, is the best way I can describe it. 1And let me see if I can do that in a color that I 1haven't done yet. 1Oh, maybe this purple color. 1So you can imagine a pure p orbital. 1So a pure p orbital, I'm going to need to draw it even bigger 1than that, actually. 1A pure p orbital, it normally wouldn't be that big relative 1to things, but I have to make them overlap. 1So it's a pure p orbital that's kind of going in, maybe 1you can imagine, the z-axis, that the other orbitals are 1kind of a Mercedes sign in the x, y plane. 1And now you have the z-axis going straight up and down, 1and those bottom two have to overlap so let 1me draw them bigger. 1 1So it looks like that and it looks like that. 1And they're going straight up and down. 1And notice, they are now overlapping. 1So this bond right here is this bond. 1I could've drawn them in either way, but it's that 1second bond. 1And so what's happening now to the structure? 1So let me make it very clear. 1This right here, that is a pi bond, and this right here is 1also-- it's the same pi bond. 1It's this guy right here. 1It's the second bond in the double bond. 1But what's happening here? 1Well, first of all, by itself it would be a weaker bond, but 1because we already have a sigma bond that's making these 1molecules come closer together, this pi bond will 1make them come even closer together. 1So this distance right here is closer than if we were to just 1have a single sigma bond there. 1Now, on top of that, the really interesting thing is, 1if we just had a sigma bond here, both of these molecules 1could kind of rotate around the bond axis. 1They would be able to rotate around the bond axis if you 1just had one sigma bond there. 1But since we have these pi bonds that are parallel to 1each other and they're kind of overlapping and they're kind 1of locked in to that configuration, you can no 1longer rotate. 1If one of these molecules rotates, the other one's going 1to rotate with it because these two 1guys are locked together. 1So what this pi bond does in the situation is it makes this 1carbon-carbon double bond-- it means that the double bonds 1are going to be rigid, that you can't have one molecule 1kind of flipping, swapping these two hydrogens, without 1the other one having to flip with it. 1So you wouldn't be able to kind of swap configurations of 1the hydrogens relative to the other side. 1That's what it causes. 1So, hopefully, that gives you a good understanding of the 1difference between sigma and pi bond. 1And if you're curious, when you're dealing with-- just to 1kind of make it clear, if we were dealing with ethyne, this 1is an example of ethene, but ethyne looks like this. 1You have a triple bond. 1And so you have each side pointing to one hydrogen. 1In this case, one of these, so the first bonds, you can 1imagine, so these bonds are all sigma bonds. 1They're actually sp hybridized. 1Your 2s orbital only mixes with one of the p's, so these 1are sp hybrid orbitals forming sigma bonds, so all of these 1right here. 1And then both of these-- let me do this in different color. 1Both of these are pi bonds. 1And if you had to imagine it, could imagine another pi bond 1kind of coming out of the page and another one here coming 1out of the page and into the page, out and into the page, 1and they, too, are overlapping, and you just have 1one hydrogen pointing out in each direction. 1Maybe I'll make another video on that. 1So, hopefully, you-- 1",science_organic-chemistry_gen-chem-review
" Let's graph ourselves some inequalities. So let's say I had the inequality y is less than or equal to 4x plus 3. On our xy coordinate plane, we want to show all the x and y points that satisfy this condition right here. So a good starting point might be to break up this less than or equal to, because we know how to graph y is equal to 4x plus 3. So this thing is the same thing as y could be less than 4x plus 3, or y could be equal to 4x plus 3. That's what less than or equal means. It could be less than or equal. And the reason why I did that on this first example problem is because we know how to graph that. So let's graph that. Try to draw a little bit neater than that. So that is-- no, that's not good. So that is my vertical axis, my y-axis. This is my x-axis, right there. And then we know the y-intercept, the y-intercept is 3. So the point 0, 3-- 1, 2, 3-- is on the line. And we know we have a slope of 4. Which means if we go 1 in the x-direction, we're going to go up 4 in the y. So 1, 2, 3, 4. So it's going to be right here. And that's enough to draw a line. We could even go back in the x-direction. If we go 1 back in the x-direction, we're going to go down 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. So that's also going to be a point on the line. So my best attempt at drawing this line is going to look something like-- this is the hardest part. It's going to look something like that. That is a line. It should be straight. I think you get the idea. That right there is the graph of y is equal to 4x plus 3. So let's think about what it means to be less than. So all of these points satisfy this inequality, but we have more. This is just these points over here. What about all these where y ix less than 4x plus 3? So let's think about what this means. Let's pick up some values for x. When x is equal to 0, what does this say? When x is equal to 0, then that means y is going to be less than 0 plus 3. y is less than 3. When x is equal to negative 1, what is this telling us? 4 times negative 1 is negative 4, plus 3 is negative 1. y would be less than negative 1. When x is equal to 1, what is this telling us? 4 times 1 is 4, plus 3 is 7. So y is going to be less than 7. So let's at least try to plot these. So when x is equal to-- let's plot this one first. When x is equal to 0, y is less than 3. So it's all of these points here-- that I'm shading in in green-- satisfy that right there. If I were to look at this one over here, when x is negative 1, y is less than negative 1. So y has to be all of these points down here. When x is equal to 1, y is less than 7. So it's all of these points down here. And in general, you take any point x-- let's say you take this point x right there. If you evaluate 4x plus 3, you're going to get the point on the line. That is that x times 4 plus 3. Now the y's that satisfy it, it could be equal to that point on the line, or it could be less than. So it's going to go below the line. So if you were to do this for all the possible x's, you would not only get all the points on this line which we've drawn, you would get all the points below the line. So now we have graphed this inequality. It's essentially this line, 4x plus 3, with all of the area below it shaded. Now, if this was just a less than, not less than or equal sign, we would not include the actual line. And the convention to do that is to actually make the line a dashed line. This is the situation if we were dealing with just less than 4x plus 3. Because in that situation, this wouldn't apply, and we would just have that. So the line itself wouldn't have satisfied it, just the area below it. Let's do one like that. So let's say we have y is greater than negative x over 2 minus 6. So a good way to start-- the way I like to start these problems-- is to just graph this equation right here. So let me just graph-- just for fun-- let me graph y is equal to-- this is the same thing as negative 1/2 minus 6. So if we were to graph it, that is my vertical axis, that is my horizontal axis. And our y-intercept is negative 6. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So that's my y-intercept. And my slope is negative 1/2. Oh, that should be an x there, negative 1/2 x minus 6. So my slope is negative 1/2, which means when I go 2 to the right, I go down 1. So if I go 2 to the right, I'm going to go down 1. If I go 2 to the left, if I go negative 2, I'm going to go up 1. So negative 2, up 1. So my line is going to look like this. My line is going to look like that. That's my best attempt at drawing the line. So that's the line of y is equal to negative 1/2 x minus 6. Now, our inequality is not greater than or equal, it's just greater than negative x over 2 minus 6, or greater than negative 1/2 x minus 6. So using the same logic as before, for any x-- so if you take any x, let's say that's our particular x we want to pick-- if you evaluate negative x over 2 minus 6, you're going to get that point right there. You're going to get the point on the line. But the y's that satisfy this inequality are the y's greater than that. So it's going to be not that point-- in fact, you draw an open circle there-- because you can't include the point of negative 1/2 x minus 6. But it's going to be all the y's greater than that. That'd be true for any x. You take this x. You evaluate negative 1/2 or negative x over 2 minus 6, you're going to get this point over here. The y's that satisfy it are all the y's above that. So all of the y's that satisfy this equation, or all of the coordinates that satisfy this equation, is this entire area above the line. And we're not going to include the line. So the convention is to make this line into a dashed line. And let me draw-- I'm trying my best to turn it into a dashed line. I'll just erase sections of the line, and hopefully it will look dashed to you. So I'm turning that solid line into a dashed line to show that it's just a boundary, but it's not included in the coordinates that satisfy our inequality. The coordinates that satisfy our equality are all of this yellow stuff that I'm shading above the line. Anyway, hopefully you found that helpful.",math_in-in-grade-11-ncert_in-in-class11-linear-inequalities
" Welcome to the video on basic subtraction. Let's do a little bit a review of basic addition first. If I said 4 plus 3, what did this mean? What did that equal? Well, there were a couple of ways we could have viewed this. We could have said I had 4 of something. Let's say I had 4 circles or I don't know, I had 4 lemons for breakfast. So 1, 2, 3, 4 lemons for breakfast. And let's say, I had another 3 lemons for lunch. 1, 2, 3, and so you could view 4 plus 3 as how many total lemons did I have? I'm adding 3 to 4. So how many total did I have? Well, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So I had a total of 7 lemons. Another way we could have viewed that is we could have drawn our number line. And I'll draw it in yellow because-- now that's not wide enough. I'll draw it in yellow because we're talking about lemons. So let's say that's our number line. And if I start at the number-- let me draw all of the numbers. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So you could think about this as saying, well, we're on the number line. We start at the number 4. That's this number 4. And we're adding 3 to it. So we'll increase, along the number line by 3. So we'll go 1, 2, 3 and you end up at 7. So you could say if I have 4 and I get 3 more, I get 7. Or if I increase 4 by 3 I also get 7. So what's subtraction now? Because that's what this video is about. I shouldn't waste all of our time talking about addition. So let's take the example of 4 minus 3. What is that equal to? Let me switch colors just to keep things interesting. So what is 4 minus 3 equal to? Subtraction or minus is the opposite of addition. So in addition you're doing something more, you're adding. I don't want to use the word adding to define addition, but that's what you're doing. I had 4 lemons and then I had 3 more. In subtraction you're taking away. So this example, if I started with 4 lemons, let's say I had 4 lemons on a plate. If I'm subtracting 3, if I'm saying minus 3, instead of adding these 3 and getting 7, I'm going to take 3 away. So maybe I'm eating them or maybe I'm giving them to you in exchange for watching these videos. So to take away 3 from this 4, let's say this one goes away, this one goes away, and this one goes away. How many lemons would we have left? Well, this is the only one that I haven't crossed out. So we would have 1 lemon left. And this would be the lemon that's left. Didn't have to be that one, I could have crossed out any of the 3. Another way to view that, let's draw the same lemon colored number line. Let's say that this is the number line right here. And I'll draw all the same numbers. So that's 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Of course, the number line keeps going. There's no largest number. And you can imagine, any number that you can think of, I can think of one higher than that. So there is no largest number. So that's why we draw that arrow there. I could never draw the entire number line. But anyway, back to subtraction. So we're starting at 4 lemons, right? When we added 3-- plus 3-- we went to the right 4 spaces on the number line. And that's because the right is increasing value. So we went from 4 to 5. That was one more. 5 to 6 was two more, and 7 was 3 more. Now we're taking away from 4. So what do we do? What would you think we do? Well, since we're taking away we're going to decrease the total number of lemons we have. So we take away one, we get to 3. Take away two, get to 2. Take away three, we took away three, right? So we'll go back 1, 2, 3 along the number line and we'll end up at 1. And that's this 1 right here. So just to review, addition is you're doing more or something. Subtraction is you are taking away. If you think about it on the number line, addition is increasing along the number line by that amount. So in this case we increased along the number line by 3. And so we went from 4 to 7. In the subtraction case we decrease back on the number line. So we decrease by the amount that you're subtracting. So in this case we decreased by 3. We went back 1, 2, 3 and we had 1. And the other way to view it, if I have 4 of something. If I give 3 away or if I ate 3 of them or I don't know what I did to 3 of them. If I lost 3 of them I would have 1 left. Now let me show you some interesting things about subtraction. So we know that 4 minus 3 is equal to 1. Let me show you something else that's interesting. What is 4 minus 1? Well, we could use either example. Let's do the lemon example. Let's do apples now; I'm bored of the lemons. Let's say I 1, 2, 3, 4. I have a new pen, sometimes it doesn't draw right. Let's say I had 4 apples. This is the example we're dealing with. And I were to eat one of them. So one of them were to go away. How many apples would I have left? Well, 3-- 1, 2, 3. So 4 minus 1 is equal to 3. And if we did it on the number line, if we started at 4 and we subtracted 1-- we took 1 away. So we're going to become one smaller. We go back one, we get 3. Either way works. But isn't this interesting? 4 minus 3 is equal to 1 and 4 minus 1 is equal to 3. You might say, well, did I pick the numbers just so it worked? Well, it turns out that it's always true. Well, I don't want to get too technical, but we're already touching on something that you'll learn later, maybe in algebra one day. But actually I don't want to go into all that right now. So where does this come from? Well, this is also based on the fact that 3 plus 1-- I didn't want to confuse you. So I apologize if I did. But I'll show you another interesting thing. What is 3 plus 1? 3 plus 1 is equal to what? Well, that's easy. You know that from basic addition. You can start on the number line at 3 and add 1 do it. And where do you end up? You end up at 4. 3 plus 1 is equal to 4. Or you could have started at 1 on the number line and added 3. 1, 2, 3 and you would have also ended up at 4. So we also know that you could have switch this either way. Both of those are equal 4. What do you see here? Well, there's a bunch of things I've written here and they all kind of relate to each other. 1 plus 3 is equal to 4. 3 plus 1 is equal to 4. 4 minus 1 is 3. Essentially, 4 minus 1 and getting 3 is the exact same-- you're saying the same thing as 3 plus 1 is equal to 4. This statement says if I add 1 to 3 I get 4. This is saying if I take away 1 from 4 I get 3. So if I start at 4, move back, I get 3. This is saying if I start at 3, and I move up 1, I get 4. Hopefully that gives you a little bit of intuition about what subtraction is. In the next video I'll just do as many basic subtraction problems I can do in 10 minutes. And then you'll be ready to do the exercises. See you soon.",math_arithmetic-home_addition-subtraction
" SAL: The notion of a half-life is useful, if we're dealing with increments of time that are multiples of a half-life. For example, where time equals zero, we have 100% of our substance. Then after time equals one half-life, we'd have 50% of our substance. At time is equal to two half-lives, we'd have 25% of our substance, and so on and so forth. So if I say that three half-lives have gone by-- in the case of carbon that would be, what, roughly 15,000 years-- I can tell you roughly, or almost exactly, what percentage of my original element I still have. In the case of carbon-14, I'll tell you what percentage of my original carbon-14 has not decayed into nitrogen, as yet, nitrogen-14. And that's useful, but what if I care about how much carbon I have after 1/2 a year, or after 1/2 a half life, or after three billion years, or after 10 minutes? What if I want a general function. A general function, as a function of time, that tells me the number, or the amount, of my decaying substance I have. So that's what we're going to do in this video. And it's going to be a little mathy, but I think the math is pretty straightforward, especially if you've taken a first-year course in calculus. And this is actually a pretty neat application of it. So let's just think a little bit about the rate of change, or the probability, or the number particles that are changing at any given time. So if we say, the difference or change in our number of particles, or the amount of particles, in any very small period of time, what's this going to be dependent on? This is the number particles we have in a given period time. This is our rate of change. So one thing, we know that our rate of change is going down. We know it's a negative number. We know that, in the case of radioactive decay, I could do the same exercise with compounding growth, where I would say, oh no, it's not a negative number, that our growth is dependent on how much we have. In this case the amount we're decaying is proportional, but it's going to be the negative of how much of the actual compound we already have. Let me explain that. So what I'm saying is, look, our amount of decay is proportional to the amount of the substance that we already are dealing with. And just to maybe make that a little bit more intuitive, imagine a situation here where you have 1 times 10 to the 9th. You have a billion carbon atoms. And let's say over here you have 1 times 10 to the 6th carbon atoms. And if you look at it at over some small period of time, let's say, if you look at it over one second, let's say our dt. dt as an infinitesimally small time, but let's say it's a change in time. It's a delta t. And let's say over one second, you observe that this sample had, I don't know, let's say you saw 1000 carbon particles. You really wouldn't see that with carbon-14, but this is just for the sake of our intuition. Let's say over one second you saw 1000 carbon particles per second here. Well here you have 1000th of the number particles in this sample as this one. So, for every thousand particles you saw decaying here, you'd really expect to see one carbon particle per second here. Just because you have a smaller amount. Now I don't know what the actual constant is. But we know that no matter what substance we're talking about, this constant is dependent on the substance. Carbon's going to be different from uranium, is going to be different from, you know, we looked at radon. They're all going to have different quantities right here. And we can see that. We'll actually do it in the next video, you can actually calculate this from the half-life. But the rate of change is always going to be dependent on the number of particles you have, right? I mean, we saw that here with half-life. When you have 1/2 the number of particles, you lose 1/2 as much. Here, if we start with 100 particles here, we went to 50 particles, then we went to 25. When you start with 50, in a period of time you lose 25. When you start with 100, you lose 50. So clearly the amount you lose is dependent on the amount you started with, right? Over any fraction of time, and here it's a very small fraction. So what I set up here is really fairly simple, but it doesn't sound so simple to a lot of people if you say it's a differential equation. We can actually solve this using pretty straightforward techniques. This is actually a separation of variables problem. And so, what can we do? Let's divide both sides by N. We want to get all the N's on this side and all the t stuff on the other side. So if we have 1 over N, dN over dt is equal to minus lambda. I just divided both sides of this by N. And then I can multiply both sides of this by dt, and I get 1 over N dN is equal to minus lambda dt. Now I can take the integral of both sides of this equation. And what do I get? What's the antiderivative? I'm taking the indefinite integral or the antiderivative. What's the antiderivative of 1 over N? Well that's the natural log of N plus some constant-- I'll just do that in blue-- plus some constant. And then that equals-- What's the antiderivative of just some constant? Well it's just that constant times the derivative, the variable. We're taking the antiderivative with respect to. So minus lambda, times t, plus some constant. These are different constants, but they're arbitrary. So if we want, we can just subtract that constant from that constant, and put them all on one side and then we just get another constant. So this boils down to our solution to our differential equation is the natural log of N is equal to minus lambda-t, plus some other constant, I call it c3, it doesn't matter. And now if we want to just make this a function of N in terms of t, let's take both of these, or both take e to the power of both sides of this. You can view that as kind of the inverse natural log. So e to the power of ln of N, ln of N is just saying what power do you raise e to to get to N? So if you raise e to that power, you get N. So I'm just raising both sides of this equation. I'm raising e to both sides of this equation. e to the ln of N is just N. And that is equal to e to the minus lambda-t, plus c3. And now this can be rewritten as, N is equal to e to the minus lambda-t, times e to the c3. And now once again this is an arbitrary constant, so we can just really rename that as, I don't know, let me rename it as c4. So, our solution to our differential equation, N, as a function of t, is equal to our c4 constant, c4e to the minus lambda-t. Now let's say, even better, let's say is N equals 0. Let's say that N equals 0. We have N sub 0 of our sample. That's how much we're starting off with. So let's see if we can substitute that into our equation to solve for c4. So we said N sub-0 is equal to, let's put 0 in here, so let's see, that's equal to N sub naught. And that's equal to c4 times e to the minus lambda, times 0. Well, minus anything times 0 is 0. So it's e to the 0. So that's just 1. So c4 is equal to N naught, our starting amount for the sample. So we've actually got an expression. We have the number of particles, or the amount as a function of t, is equal to the amount that we start off with, at time is equal to 0, times e to the minus lambda, times time. And we just have to be careful that we're always using the time constant when we solve for the different coefficients. So this seems all abstract. How does this relate to half-life? Well let's try to figure out this equation for carbon. This'll be true for anything where we have radioactive decay. If we actually had a plus sign here it'd be exponential growth as well. We know that carbon, c-14, has a 5,700-year half-life. So the way you could think about it, is if at time equals 0 you start off with t-- So time equals 0. t equals-- let me write that down. If at N of 0 is equal to-- and we could write 100 there if we want. Actually why don't we do that? If N of 0 we start off with 100. And then at N of 5,700 years-- so we're going to take t to be in years, you just have to be consistent with your units-- how much will we have left? We'll have 50 left. We could have written x and x over two here, and it would have all have worked out in the end. So let's see, let's apply that to this equation and try to solve this for lambda. So we know N of 0 is equal to 100. So we immediately know that we can write this equation as N of t is equal to 100e, to the minus lambda-t, at least in this exact circumstance. 1And we also know that N of 5,700-- so that means, N of 15,700-- that is equal to, we just said, that's one 1half-life away. 1So we have 1/2 as much of our compound left. 1That's equal to 50, which is equal to the 5,700th power 1times lambda. 1So it's equal to 100 times e, to the minus 1lambda, times 5,700. 1And now we just solve for lambda. 1Then we'll have a general equation for how much carbon 1we have at any given moment in time. 1So if you divide both sides of this by 100. 1What do we get? 1We get 0.5, we have 1/2, is equal to e to the-- let me 1just write minus 5,700 lambda, and then we could take the 1natural log of both sides. 1So then we get-- scroll down a bit-- the natural log of 1/2 1is equal to the-- the natural log of this is just minus 15,700 lambda. 1To solve for lambda, you get lambda is equal to the natural 1log of 1/2, over minus 5,700. 1So let me see what that is. 1Let's see what that is. 1So 0.5 natural log is that, divided by minus 5,700. 15,700 negative is equal to 1.2 times 10 to the negative 4. 1Is equal to 1.21 times 10 to the minus 4. 1So there you have it, we figured out our lambda. 1So the general equation for how much carbon-14 we can 1expect at any moment in time, t, where t is in years, is N 1of t is equal to the amount of carbon we start off with, 1times e to the minus lambda. 1The minus lambda is 1.21 times 10 to the minus 14, times t in years. 1So now if you say after 1/2 a year, you just plug it in and, 1you have to tell me how much you started off with, and then 1I can tell you how much you have after 1/2 a year, or 1after a billion years, or after a gazillion years. 1And we'll do a lot more of these 1problems in the next video.",science_in-in-class-12th-physics-india_nuclei
" -  Let's say that we have the fraction 9/10, and I want to add to that the fraction 1/6. What is this, what is this going to equal? So when you first look at this, you say, ""Oh, I have different denominators here. It's not obvious how I add these."" And you'd be right and the way to actually move forward is to find a common denominator, to convert both of these fractions into fractions that have a common denominator. So how do you think about a common denominator? Well, a common denominator's gonna have to be a common multiple of these two denominators of 10 and six. So what's a common multiple of 10 and six? And it's usually simplest to find the least common multiple, and a good way of doing that is start with the larger denominator here, 10, and say, okay is 10 divisible by six? No. Okay, now, is 20 divisible by six? No. Is 30 divisible by six? Yes. 30 is divisible by six. So I'm just going through the multiples of 10 and saying, ""Well what is the smallest multiple of 10 that is divisible by six?"" And that's going to be 30. So I could rewrite both of these fractions as something over 30. So nine over 10. How would I write that as something over 30? Well I multiply the denominator, I'm multiplying the denominator by three. So I've just multiplied the denominator by three. So if I don't want to change the value of the fraction, I have to do the same thing to the numerator. I have to multiply that by three as well because now I'm just multiplying the numerator by three and the denominator by three, and that doesn't change the value of the fraction. So nine times three is 27. So once again, 9/10 and 27/30 represent the same number. I've just written it now with a denominator of 30, and that's useful because I can also write 1/6 with a denominator of 30. Let's do that. So 1/6 is what over 30? I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about it. So what did we do go from six to 30? We had to multiply by five. So if we multiply the denominator by five, we have to multiply the numerator by five as well, so one times five, one times five is five. So 9/10 is the same thing as 27/30, and 1/6 is the same thing as 5/30. And now we can add, now we can add and it's fairly straightforward. We have a certain number of 30ths, added to another number of 30ths, so 27/30 + 5/30, well that's going to be 27, that's going to be 27 plus five, plus five, plus 5/30, plus 5/30, which of course going to be equal to 32/30. 32 over 30, and if we want, we could try to reduce this fraction. We have a common factor of 32 and 30, they're both divisible by two. So if we divide the numerator and the denominator by two, numerator divided by two is 16, denominator divided by two is 15. So, this is the same thing as 16/15, and if I wanted to write this as a mixed number, 15 goes into 16 one time with a remainder one. So this is the same thing as 1 1/15. Let's do another example. Let's say that we wanted to add, we wanted to add 1/2 to to 11/12, to 11 over 12. And I encourage you to pause the video and see if you could work this out. Well like we saw before, we wanna find a common denominator. If these had the same denominator, we could just add them immediately, but we wanna find a common denominator because right now they're not the same. Well what we wanna find is a multiple, a common multiple of two and 12, and ideally we'll find the lowest common multiple of two and 12, and just like we did before, let's start with the larger of the two numbers, 12. Now we could just say well 12 times one is 12, so that we could view that as the lowest multiple of 12. And is that divisible by two? Yeah, sure. 12 is divisible by two. So 12 is actually the least common multiple of two and 12, so we could write both of these fractions as something over 12. So 1/2 is what over 12? Well to go from two to 12, you multiply by six, so we'll also multiply the numerator by six. Now we see 1/2, and 6/12, these are the same thing. One is half of two, six is half of 12. And how would we write 11/12 as something over 12? Well it's already written as something over 12, 11/12 already has 12 in the denominator, so we don't have to change that. 11/12, and now we're ready to add. So this is going to be equal to six, this is going to be equal to six plus 11, six plus 11 over 12. Over 12. We have 6/12 plus 11/12, it's gonna be six plus 11 over 12, which is equal to, six plus 11 is 17/12. If we wanted to write it as a mixed number, that is what, 12 goes into 17 one time with a remainder of five, so 1 5/12. Let's do one more of these. This is strangely fun. Alright. Let's say that we wanted to add, We're gonna add 3/4 to, we're gonna add 3/4 to 1/5. To one over five. What is this going to be? And once again, pause the video and see if you could work it out. Well we have different denominators here, and we wanna find, we wanna rewrite these so they have the same denominators, so we have to find a common multiple, ideally the least common multiple. So what's the least common multiple of four and five? Well let's start with the larger number, and let's look at its multiples and keep increasing them until we get one that's divisible by four. So five is not divisible by four. 10 is not divisible by four, or perfectly divisible by four is what we care about. 15 is not perfectly divisible by four. 20 is divisible by four, in fact, that is five times four. That is 20. So what we could do is, we could write both of these fractions as having 20 in the denominator, or 20 as the denominator. So we could write 3/4 is something over 20. So to go from four to 20 in the denominator, we multiplied by five. So we also do that to the numerator. We multiply by three times five to get 15. All I did to go from four to 20, multiplied by five. So I have to do the same thing to the numerator, three times five is 15. 3/4 is the same thing as 15/20, and over here. 1/5. What is that over 20? Well to go from five to 20, you have to multiply by four. So we have to do the same thing to the numerator. I have to multiply this numerator times four to get 4/20. So now I've rewritten this instead of 3/4 plus 1/5, it's now written as 15/20 plus 4/20. And what is that going to be? Well that's going to be 15 plus four is 19/20. 19/20, and we're done.",math_cc-fifth-grade-math_imp-fractions-3
" In this video, I want to introduce you to the idea of an exponential function and really just show you how fast these things can grow. So let's just write an example exponential function here. So let's say we have y is equal to 3 to the x power. Notice, this isn't x to the third power, this is 3 to the x power. Our independent variable x is the actual exponent. So let's make a table here to see how quickly this thing grows, and maybe we'll graph it as well. So let's take some x values here. Let's start with x is equal to negative 4. Then we'll go to negative 3, negative 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. And let's figure out what our y-values are going to be for each of these x-values. Now, here, y is going to be 3 to the negative 4 power, which is equal to 1 over 3 to the fourth power. 3 to the third is 27 times 3 again is 81. So this is equal to 1/81. When x is equal to negative 3, y is 3. We'll do this in a different color. This color is hard to read. y is 3 to the negative 3 power. Well, that's 1 over 3 to the third power, which is equal to 1/27. So we're going from a super-small number to a less super-small number. And then 3 to the negative 2 power is going to be 1/9, right? 1 over 3 squared, and then we have 3 to the 0 power, which is just equal to 1. So we're getting a little bit larger, a little bit larger, but you'll see that we are about to explode. Now, we have 3 to the first power. That's equal to 3. So we have 3 to the second power, right? y is equal to 3 to the second power. That's 9. 3 to the third power, 27. 3 to the fourth power, 81. If we were to put the fifth power, 243. Let's graph this, just to get an idea of how quickly we're exploding. Let me draw my axes here. So that's my x-axis and that is my y-axis. And let me just do it in increments of 5, because I really want to get the general shape of the graph here. So let me just draw as straight a line as I can. Let's say this is 5, 10, 15. Actually, I won't get to 81 that way. I want to get to 81. Well, that's good enough. Let me draw it a little bit differently than I've drawn it. So let me draw it down here because all of these values, you might notice, are positive values because I have a positive base. So let me draw it like this. Good enough. And then let's say I have 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80. That is 80 right there. That's 10. That's 30. That'll be good for approximation. And then let's say that this is negative 5. This is positive 5 right here. And actually, let me stretch it out a little bit more. Let's say this is negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4. Then we have 1, 2, 3, and 4. So when x is equal to 0, we're equal to 1, right? When x is equal to 0, y is equal to 1, which is right around there. When x is equal to 1, y is equal to 3, which is right around there. When x is equal to 2, y is equal to 9, which is right around there. When x equal to 3, y is equal to 27, which is right around there. When x is equal to 4, y is equal to 81. You see very quickly this is just exploding. If I did 5, we'd go to 243, which wouldn't even fit on my screen. When you go to negative 1, we get smaller and smaller. So at negative 1, we're at 1/9. Eventually, you're not even going to see this. It's going to get closer and closer to zero. As this approaches larger and larger negative numbers, or I guess I should say smaller negative numbers, so 3 to the negative thousand, 3 to the negative million, we're getting numbers closer and closer to zero without actually ever approaching zero. So as we go from negative infinity, x is equal to negative infinity, we're getting very close to zero, we're slowly getting our way ourselves away from zero, but then bam! Once we start getting into the positive numbers, we just explode. We just explode, and we keep exploding at an ever-increasing rate. So the idea here is just to show you that exponential functions are really, really dramatic. Well, you can always construct a faster expanding function. For example, you could say y is equal to x to the x, even faster expanding, but out of the ones that we deal with in everyday life, this is one of the fastest. So given that, let's do some word problems that just give us an appreciation for exponential functions. So let's say that someone sends out a chain letter in week 1. In week 1, someone sent a chain letter to 10 people. And the chain letter says you have to now send this chain letter to 10 more new people, and if you don't, you're going to have bad luck, and your hair is going to fall out, and you'll marry a frog, or whatever else. So all of these people agree and they go and each send it to 10 people the next week. So in week 2, they go out and each send it to 10 more people. So each of those original 10 people are each sending out 10 more of the letters. So now 100 people have the letters, right? Each of those 10 sent out 10, so that 100 letters were sent out. 10 were sent. Here, 100 were sent. In week 3, what's going to happen? Each of those 100 people who got this one, they're each going to send out 10, assuming that everyone is really into chain letters. So 1,000 people are going to get it. And so the general pattern here is, the people who receive it, so in week n where n is the week we're talking about, how many people received the letter? In week n, we have 10 to the nth people receive-- i before e except after c-- the letter. So if I were to ask you, how many people are getting the letter on the sixth week? How many people are actually going to receive that letter? Well, what's 10 to the sixth power? 10 to the sixth is equal to 1 with six zeroes, which is 1 million people are going to receive that letter in just 6 weeks, just sending out 10 letters each. And obviously, in the real world, most people chuck these in the basket, so you don't have this good of a hit rate. But if you did, if every 10 people you sent it to also sent it to 10 people and so on and so forth, by the sixth week, you would have a million people. And by the ninth week, you would have a billion people. And frankly, the week after that, you would run out of people. I'll see you in the next video.",math_math1_exp-func
" In the last video, I introduced you to the notion of-- well, really we started with the random variable. And then we moved on to the two types of random variables. You had discrete, that took on a finite number of values. And the these, I was going to say that they tend to be integers, but they don't always have to be integers. You have discrete, so finite meaning you can't have an infinite number of values for a discrete random variable. And then we have the continuous, which can take on an infinite number. And the example I gave for continuous is, let's say random variable x. And people do tend to use-- let me change it a little bit, just so you can see it can be something other than an x. Let's have the random variable capital Y. They do tend to be capital letters. Is equal to the exact amount of rain tomorrow. And I say rain because I'm in northern California. It's actually raining quite hard right now. We're short right now, so that's a positive. We've been having a drought, so that's a good thing. But the exact amount of rain tomorrow. And let's say I don't know what the actual probability distribution function for this is, but I'll draw one and then we'll interpret it. Just so you can kind of think about how you can think about continuous random variables. So let me draw a probability distribution, or they call it its probability density function. And we draw like this. And let's say that there is-- it looks something like this. Like that. All right, and then I don't know what this height is. So the x-axis here is the amount of rain. Where this is 0 inches, this is 1 inch, this is 2 inches, this is 3 inches, 4 inches. And then this is some height. Let's say it peaks out here at, I don't know, let's say this 0.5. So the way to think about it, if you were to look at this and I were to ask you, what is the probability that Y-- because that's our random variable-- that Y is exactly equal to 2 inches? That Y is exactly equal to two inches. What's the probability of that happening? Well, based on how we thought about the probability distribution functions for the discrete random variable, you'd say OK, let's see. 2 inches, that's the case we care about right now. Let me go up here. You'd say it looks like it's about 0.5. And you'd say, I don't know, is it a 0.5 chance? And I would say no, it is not a 0.5 chance. And before we even think about how we would interpret it visually, let's just think about it logically. What is the probability that tomorrow we have exactly 2 inches of rain? Not 2.01 inches of rain, not 1.99 inches of rain. Not 1.99999 inches of rain, not 2.000001 inches of rain. Exactly 2 inches of rain. I mean, there's not a single extra atom, water molecule above the 2 inch mark. And not as single water molecule below the 2 inch mark. It's essentially 0, right? It might not be obvious to you, because you've probably heard, oh, we had 2 inches of rain last night. But think about it, exactly 2 inches, right? Normally if it's 2.01 people will say that's 2. But we're saying no, this does not count. It can't be 2 inches. We want exactly 2. 1.99 does not count. Normally our measurements, we don't even have tools that can tell us whether it is exactly 2 inches. No ruler you can even say is exactly 2 inches long. At some point, just the way we manufacture things, there's going to be an extra atom on it here or there. So the odds of actually anything being exactly a certain measurement to the exact infinite decimal point is actually 0. The way you would think about a continuous random variable, you could say what is the probability that Y is almost 2? So if we said that the absolute value of Y minus is 2 is less than some tolerance? Is less than 0.1. And if that doesn't make sense to you, this is essentially just saying what is the probability that Y is greater than 1.9 and less than 2.1? These two statements are equivalent. I'll let you think about it a little bit. But now this starts to make a little bit of sense. Now we have an interval here. So we want all Y's between 1.9 and 2.1. So we are now talking about this whole area. And area is key. So if you want to know the probability of this occurring, you actually want the area under this curve from this point to this point. And for those of you who have studied your calculus, that would essentially be the definite integral of this probability density function from this point to this point. So from-- let me see, I've run out of space down here. So let's say if this graph-- let me draw it in a different color. If this line was defined by, I'll call it f of x. I could call it p of x or something. The probability of this happening would be equal to the integral, for those of you who've studied calculus, from 1.9 to 2.1 of f of x dx. Assuming this is the x-axis. So it's a very important thing to realize. Because when a random variable can take on an infinite number of values, or it can take on any value between an interval, to get an exact value, to get exactly 1.999, the probability is actually 0. It's like asking you what is the area under a curve on just this line. Or even more specifically, it's like asking you what's the area of a line? An area of a line, if you were to just draw a line, you'd say well, area is height times base. Well the height has some dimension, but the base, what's the width the a line? As far as the way we've defined a line, a line has no with, and therefore no area. And it should make intuitive sense. That the probability of a very super-exact thing happening is pretty much 0. That you really have to say, OK what's the probably that we'll get close to 2? And then you can define an area. And if you said oh, what's the probability that we get someplace between 1 and 3 inches of rain, then of course the probability is much higher. The probability is much higher. It would be all of this kind of stuff. You could also say what's the probability we have less than 0.1 of rain? Then you would go here and if this was 0.1, you would calculate this area. And you could say what's the probability that we have more than 4 inches of rain tomorrow? Then you would start here and you'd calculate the area in the curve all the way to infinity, if the curve has area all the way to infinity. And hopefully that's not an infinite number, right? Then your probability won't make any sense. But hopefully if you take this sum it comes to some number. And we'll say there's only a 10% chance that you have more than 4 inches tomorrow. And all of this should immediately lead to one light bulb in your head, is that the probability of all of the events that might occur can't be more than 100%. Right? All the events combined-- there's a probability of 1 that one of these events will occur. So essentially, the whole area under this curve has to be equal to 1. So if we took the integral of f of x from 0 to infinity, this thing, at least as I've drawn it, dx should be equal to 1. For those of you who've studied calculus. For those of you who haven't, an integral is just the area under a curve. And you can watch the calculus videos if you want to learn a little bit more about how to do them. And this also applies to the discrete probability distributions. Let me draw one. The sum of all of the probabilities have to be equal to 1. And that example with the dice-- or let's say, since it's faster to draw, the coin-- the two probabilities have to be equal to 1. So this is 1, 0, where x is equal to 1 if we're heads or 0 if we're tails. Each of these have to be 0.5. Or they don't have to be 0.5, but if one was 0.6, the other would have to be 0.4. They have to add to 1. If one of these was-- you can't have a 60% probability of getting a heads and then a 60% probability of getting a tails as well. Because then you would have essentially 120% probability of either of the outcomes happening, which makes no sense at all. So it's important to realize that a probability distribution function, in this case for a discrete random variable, they all have to add up to 1. So 0.5 plus 0.5. And in this case the area under the probability density function also has to be equal to 1. Anyway, I'm all the time for now. In the next video I'll introduce you to the idea of an expected value. See you soon.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-probability-of-events
" -  We're told the graph of y equals two to the x is shown below, alright. Which of the following is the graph of y equals two to the negative x minus five? So there's two changes here. Instead of two to the x, we have two to the negative x and then, we're not leaving that alone, we, then, subtract five. So let's take 'em step by step. So let's first think about what y equals two to the negative x would look like. Well, any input we now put into an x, we're now going to take the negative of. So if I input a two, it's like taking the opposite of the two and then, inputting that into two to the x. And so, what we're essentially going to do is flip this graph over the y-axis. So, here we have the point two comma four. Over here, we're going to have the point negative two comma four. When x is zero, they're going to give us the same value. So they're both going to have the same y-intercept. And so are graph is going to look like, our graph is going to look something like, this. They're going to be mirror images flipped around the y-axis. So, it's going to look like that. That is the graph of y is equal to two to the negative x. And then we have to worry about the subtracting five from it. Well, that's, you're subtracting five from your final y-value so that's going to work. You're subtracting five to get your y-value now, where your y-value is going to be five lower, is I guess the best way to say it, so this is going to shift the graph down by five. So instead of having the y-intercept there, it's going to be five lower. One, two, one, each hash mark is two so this is one, two, three, four, five, is going to be right over there. So shift down by five, two, four, five. It's going to look like that. And the asymptote, instead of the asymptote, going towards y equals zero, the asymptote is going to be at y is equal to negative five. So the asymptote is going to be y equals negative five. So it should look something like, something like what I am drawing right now. Something like, something like that. So now we can look at which choices. So this should be the graph of y equals two to the negative x minus five. So let's see which of these choices depict that. So this first choice actually seems to be spot-on. It's exactly what we drew. Well, we can look at the other ones, just in case. Well, this is, this looks like, what did they do over here? Looks like they, instead of flipping over the y-axis, they took the, they flipped over the x-axis and then they shifted down, so that's not right. Here it looks like they got what we got but they flipped it over the x-axis. And this looks like they flipped it over the y-axis but then they shifted, instead of shifting down by five, it looks like they shifted to the left by five. So we should feel pretty good especially 'cause we essentially drew this before even looking at the choice.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-3

So that's CH four, if I want to draw a dot structure for methane, I would start with carbon, and its four valence electrons, and then we would put hydrogen around that; each hydrogen has one valence electron, so we go ahead and draw in our hydrogens with one valence electron, and that gives us the Lewis Dot structure. Usually you see it drawn like this, with carbon with its four bonds to hydrogen around it, like that, and in methane, all of these bonds are equivalent, in terms of things like bond length and energy. And so the four valence electrons that carbon brought to the table over here, let me go ahead and highlight those four valence electrons, those should be equivalent, and if we look at the electron configuration for carbon, let's go ahead and do that right now. It's one S two, so go ahead and put in two electrons in the one S orbital, two S two, go ahead and put in two electrons in the two S orbital, and then two P two, and so, I'm assuming you already know your electron configuration, so it would look something like that. If we look at those four valence electrons on our orbital notation here, that would be these four electrons here, the valence electrons in the outer shell. And if we look at this, this implies that carbon would only form two bonds, because I have these unpaired electrons right here, and everything's of different energies, and so, what we see from the dot structure and experimentally, doesn't quite match up with the electron configuration here, and so to explain this difference, Linus Pauling came up with the idea of hybridization. And so, the first thing that he said was, you could go ahead and take out one of these electrons in the two S, and promote it up to the P orbital here, so let me go ahead and show that, so we've moved one of those electrons up to the two P orbital, so we're in the excited state now. And now we have the opportunity for carbon to form four bonds, however, those electrons are not of equivalent energy, and so Linus Pauling said, ""Let's do something else here: ""Let's go ahead and promote the two S orbital,"" so we're gonna take this S orbital, and we're gonna promote it in energy, and we're going to take these P orbitals and demote them in energy, so we're gonna lower those P orbitals, like that, so we have our P orbitals here. And these had one electron in each of them, but we're gonna hybridize them, so this is no longer going to be an S orbital; it's going to be an SP three hybrid orbital; this is no longer going to be a P orbital; it's going to be a SP three hybrid orbital, and same with these. So the idea is, you're taking some of the S character, and some of the P character, and you're hybridizing them together into brand new orbitals, and since you're taking this from one S orbital and three P orbitals, we're doing this using one S orbital and three P orbitals, we call this SP three hybridization, so this is SP three hybridization: We create four new, hybrid orbitals. And now we have what we're looking for, because now we have four unpaired electrons, so carbon can form four bonds now, and they're equal in energy, so that's the idea of hybridization. All right, let's think about the character, or the shape of this new hybrid orbital. Well, we know that an S orbital is shaped like a sphere, so we're taking one of those S orbitals here, so one S orbital, and we know that a P orbital is shaped like a dumbbell, so we're taking three of these P orbitals here. So one of these S orbital, and three of these P orbitals, and we're going to hybridize them together, and when that happens, in turns out the shape of the new hybrid orbital you get, has this large frontal lobe here, like this, and then a smaller back lobe, back here like this; so we're gonna make four of these. All right, so once again we have four SP three hybrid orbitals, and each one of these hybrid orbitals is gonna have an electron in it, so we can see that each one of these SP three hybrid orbitals has one electron in there, like that, and so the final orbital, the final hybrid orbitals here contain 25 percent S character. Let me go ahead and write this down here: So 25 percent S character, and 75 percent P character, in this new hybrid orbital. Once again, that's because we started out with one S orbital and three P orbitals for our hybridization. All right, let's go back to methane, and let's go ahead and draw in a picture, because now we know that this carbon is SP three hybridized, so let's go ahead and draw a picture of that hybridized carbon, here. So we're gonna go ahead and draw in our carbon, and we know that it has four SP three hybrid orbitals, and once again, when we draw the orbitals, we're gonna ignore the smaller back lobe here, so it doesn't confuse us. So we go ahead and draw in, here's one of our orbitals, for carbon, so that's an SP three hybrid orbital. Here's another SP three hybrid orbital, here's another one, and then, finally, a fourth one. So let's go back up here, to this picture, 'cause once again, we need to show that each of these hybrid orbitals has one valence electron in it, so I can go ahead and put in my one valence electron, in each of my hybrid orbitals, like that, so here's our valence electron. If we're talking about methane, so carbon is bonded to four hydrogens, each hydrogen has an un-hybridized S orbital, and each hydrogen has one electron in that, so I'm gonna go ahead and sketch that in; let's go ahead and use blue here. So here's an un-hybridized S orbital, I'm gonna go ahead and draw these in, so an un-hybridized S orbital; each one of these un-hybridized S orbitals for hydrogen has one valence electron, so I'm gonna go ahead and put in those one valence electrons, in here, like that, so same for here, and then, finally, for here. So this is just one picture of the methane molecule, so this is hydrogen, these are all the hydrogens right here, like that. All right, let's think about this bond that we formed right here, so here we have an overlap of orbitals, an overlap of an SP three hybrid orbital form carbon, with a un-hybridized S orbital from hydrogen here, and so this is a head-on overlap, so we're sharing electrons here, in this head-on overlap. And a head-on overlap, in chemistry, is called a sigma bond, so this is a sigma bond, sigma bond here, a head-on overlap, and this happens three more times in the methane molecule. So here's a head-on overlap, here's a head-on overlap, and here's a head-on overlap. And so we have a total of four sigma bonds in the methane molecule, so a single-bond here, instead of saying a single-bond now, we're saying it's also can be called, ""a sigma bond,"" and so this head-on overlap. Let's look at the ethane molecule now, so for ethane, we'll go ahead an draw that in, so ethane would be C two H six, so we have two carbons; let's go ahead and draw in those two carbons, and then six hydrogens, so we put in our six hydrogens around there, like that. All right, when we're thinking about hybridization, we've just seen, with methane, that a carbon atom with four single-bonds will be SP three hybridized. So I go back up to here, this carbon right here, four single-bonds; it's SP three hybridized, we could use that same logic and apply it to ethane, here. Each of the carbons in ethane has four single-bonds, so each carbon in ethane is SP three hybridized, so let me go ahead and put SP three hybridized here, so let's go ahead, and draw the picture with the orbitals. So let's get some more room. If each carbon is SP three hybridized, that means each carbon is gonna have four SP three hybrid orbitals. So I can go ahead and sketch in one carbon, once again, I'm ignoring the back lobe, one carbon with four SP three hybrid orbitals, and we know the other carbon is also SP three hybridized, so I can sketch in four SP three hybrid orbitals for this one too, so here's my four SP three hybrid orbitals for this carbon. All right, in terms of electrons, let's go ahead and put in our electrons here. So, let's see, there's one electron in this orbital, one electron in this orbital, one electron in this orbital, one electron from this carbon. And then, for this other carbon, so there's one electron in this orbital, one electron in this orbital, one electron in this orbital, and one electron in this orbital. And then we can go ahead and put in our hydrogens, so we know each hydrogen has an un-hybridized S orbital, with one valence electron, so I can go ahead and do that. And I'll draw in the rest of our hydrogens, so that's four hydrogens, five hydrogens, and then six hydrogens, like that. All right, we just said that a sigma bond is a head-on overlap of orbitals. So, here we have a head-on overlap of orbitals, the bond between the two carbons, and then, of course, all of these are too. So when we count all of those up, that's four, five, six, and seven; so there are seven sigma bonds in the ethane molecule, so seven sigma bonds here. And we could go up here to this dot structure, and look at them again, so here's one, two, three, four, five, six, and then seven: Seven sigma bonds. Let's focus in on the bond between the two carbons now, so this sigma bond, right in here, so that's a sigma bond, and there's free rotation about this sigma bond, so if you could imageine rotating around this bond, so these carbons can rotate in space, and that's gonna give different conformations, so you could have different confirmations of the ethane molecule, which is in later videos. 1So you have free rotation about sigma bonds. 1Let me go ahead and write that, 1'cause that's pretty important, 1so free rotation about sigma bonds. 1And then, the last thing I wanted to point out, 1about the ethane molecule here, is the bond length: 1So the length between this carbon and this carbon, 1so this bond length, in here, turns out to be 1approximately one point five four angstroms, 1so you'll see slightly different values 1in different textbooks, but we'll say 1it's approximately this value, and the reason 1we wanna know that, is we're gonna compare 1this carbon-carbon bond length to the bond length 1in some other molecules, in some later videos.",science_chemistry_chemical-bonds
" -  Plants and trees are not just great at creating their own food from sunlight, but they're also excellent in moving that food around. When they have excess of food, they move it to their storage organs. For example, if this was a carrot or a potato plant, then they would move that excess food down. So they move the excess food down and store it for future. And now let's say maybe during the winter season there isn't much sunlight so they cannot photosynthesize. So they're not able to get a lot of food. Now, they can move this food up to wherever they want. So they can move it back from the storage organs to the place where they need, maybe the growing areas. And this process of moving the food around wherever they want, we give a name to it, we call it translocation. Translocation. This is basically plants and trees moving the food around to the places they need. But the big question is, how do they do that? I mean, for one, how do they even understand which part of the plant body needs food because they don't have a brain? And secondly, what mechanism do they use to transport that food up or down according to their needs? Well, let's find out. Now before we continue, let's back up a little bit. We've already seen in previous videos that plants and trees consists of pipe-like structures to transport stuff around, that starts from the roots all the way to the leaves, and we call these structures vascular tissues. And there are two kinds, xylem that transports water and minerals from the soil to the different parts of the body, and phloem, which mostly transports food. Now if these terms look new to you or you need a refresher on this, then you can go back and watch our previous videos on intro to vascular tissues and videos on xylem and transportation. But if you feel comfortable, then let's continue. Now in this video, since we wanna talk about translocation, meaning transportation of food, we are going to be concentrating on phloem. So translocation happens inside the phloem. Food gets transferred in them, but how? Well, let's see. Let me draw xylem and phloem. So let's say this is the xylem tissue which has water in it, this is going to be important for us as well, and here is our phloem. Phloem mostly contains sugar molecules dissolved in water forming a very thick sugary sap, which is food for them. And if you're wondering what these things are over here at the sides, that is some leftover cytoplasm. The cells don't lose all of their cytoplasm. And similarly, this is the cell walls. They have developed gaps in between. So they have not lost their cell walls like in xylem, some gap is developed so that the food can, this whole sap can move throughout the phloem. And if you're wondering why it is structured like this, we'll talk a little bit about that towards the end. Anyways, imagine a couple of cells next to phloem. Let's assume these are far apart, okay, not so close and let's assume this cell has a lot of sugar molecules in it. And imagine this cell doesn't have much sugar molecules, it needs a lot. Let's say it's one of the growing regions of this plant. So it needs a lot of sugars. So how do we transport the sugar from here to here is the question? Well, you can kind of guess the process. We take some of the sugars, put it into the phloem, then we make sure it transports through the phloem till here, and then we remove the sugar and put it into this cell. That makes sense, right? But a couple of questions could be how does the phloem know in which direction to transport this food? Because that cell which is in need of sugars can be anywhere. It can be below it or it can be above this as well. So how does it know whether it has to go down or up? And secondly, how do you even move this thick sugary sap through the phloem? So let's put this back over here and let's see how this works. So the first step as you predicted is to put the sugar into the phloem tube. I'm just gonna call that loading. And this process is an active process. What does that mean? Active. Well, think about it. If the concentration over here of sugars is less than over here, then sugars will automatically diffuse from higher to lower concentration. But pretty soon the concentration will equalize. How do you move even more sugars there? Well, that requires energy. The cells have to spend some energy to move the sugar from lower to higher concentration. So, by using energy, the sugars need to be transported into the phloem. And because energy is utilized for this process, we say it's an active process. Now see what happens. Because of a lot of sugar, the concentration of sugar is much higher in this region compared to any other regions. And remember, nature always likes to balance the concentration out. So one way to reduce the concentration is to put the sugar back. But remember that's not possible, we're not doing that. So what else can nature do? Well, there's xylem right next with a lot of water. So you know what's gonna happen? Water will start flowing from xylem into the phloem, to this part of the phloem because of osmosis. So let me write that as step two. Remember osmosis it's the process in which solvent flows, like water starts flowing from a low concentration region to a higher concentration region. Basically water is flowing to try and dilute this concentration. Okay, what does that do? Well, because a lot of water is flowing in, this region of the phloem starts puffing up over there. This increases the pressure over here. And what I mean by that is you can imagine these walls are pressing on this solution, squeezing that solution a lot. Now, what do you think will happen if I squeeze this solution a lot? Well, it'll automatically start moving from here to a region where there is low pressure. It's kind of like squeezing a water balloon. And where do you think is the pressure lower? The pressure is lower where there is less sugar concentration, right? Because if there's less sugar concentration, there will be less water over here and that's exactly where you need to send your sugar molecules. So if on the top there is a cell which has very low sugar concentration, automatically that part will have low pressure, automatically this side will move up. If it turns out that somewhere in the bottom there is low concentration, automatically the pressure over there will be very low and the sap will move down. And this is how the pressure decides in what direction the sap will move. So in our example, the sap will move down from here to here. Let's call that as our step three, and we can call this the bulk flow, the bulk flow driven by pressure. And the reason we are calling it bulk flow is because this whole thing is a solution, remember. Even though I've put dots over here, this is one single solution. And so the whole solution moves down, not just this part. All right? So let me show you what that will look like. So as the solution moves, this pressure is relieved. Let me get that back to normal. And so due to the high pressure over here, this whole solution will start moving like this. The whole thing will move from high pressure to low pressure until it reaches over here. And then finally the sugar reaches the low pressure region. Because there is less concentration of sugar, it will move out of phloem and it can now be taken up by this cell. And so this we'll call it as step four, unloading happens. The sugars get unloaded from the phloem tube. So let's unload that sugar from the phloem into the required cell. And finally, remember that region which had a lot of concentration of sugar had a lot of water due to the osmosis. Well now, that concentration has lowered so, that water will move back to xylem. So in step five, again, osmosis happens and the water moves back and that's how translocation happens inside plants. Now before we summarize and wind up this video, one question we need to address is why phloem structure is a little different than that of xylem. Why does it have cytoplasm, little bit of cytoplasm left? Why are the end walls not completely gone like in the xylem? Well, that's because these cells are alive. Phloem has life cells. In contrast, xylem has dead cells. And so xylem cells can afford to lose all of their stuff because they are dead, right? But phloem cells need a little bit of cytoplasm and their cell walls to stay alive. Now that could raise even more questions. First of all, you may be wondering, how can cells stay alive without a nucleus or without a mitochondria? How can these cells be alive? Well, in fact, you know how they are staying alive? They have a partner cells which I have not shown over here, but each cell is connected to a partner. Let me show you what would that look like if I were to draw those. So these are the partner cells and they have all the stuff needed to keep these cells alive. In fact, they are life partners, okay? And that's why these cells are called companion cells. 1All right? 1And so in reality, if you're wondering, 1when you want to load the sugars, 1you have to first load it into the companion cell 1and then it goes into the phloem. 1Similarly, while unloading, 1it first goes into the companion cell 1and then it goes out of the phloem. 1But that's a small detail. 1We don't have to worry too much about that, 1so let me get rid of those. 1So it's those companion cells that keep them alive. 1But another question you might be wondering 1is why do we have to go through all that trouble 1to keep these cells alive? 1Why is it necessary that these cells need to be alive? 1Well, the answer is in this process. 1You see, we just saw that in order to load the sugar 1into the phloem, that requires energy. 1It's an active process 1and the cell can only generate energy if it is alive. 1So if the cells were dead, like in xylem, 1they wouldn't be able to generate energy, 1they wouldn't be able to load sugar, 1they wouldn't be able to accept that sugar molecules. 1It would just diffuse back 1and then the phloem transport wouldn't work. 1And xylem cells don't need to be alive 1because the mechanism of xylem 1is only based on physical forces like suction 1or the pressure from the bottom, from the roots, right? 1You don't need the cells. 1The cells don't need to use any energy 1so they can afford to be dead, but phloem needs to be alive. 1All right, that's pretty much it. 1So, let's quickly summarize. 1What did we learn in this video? 1We saw that plants and trees can move the food up or down 1based on their requirement and we called this translocation, 1and this happens inside the phloem tissues. 1And how do these sugars go from one place to another? 1Well, in the first step, we have loading 1where the sugars get loaded actively into the phloem tubes 1and this requires energy, 1that's why it's called as an active process 1and that's why these cells need to stay alive. 1And in doing so, 1because the concentration over here has increased, 1water starts flowing from xylem into the phloem 1to try and decrease that concentration due to osmosis. 1And because of that, a lot of water comes in 1and the cell now kind of all there puffs up. 1I like to imagine that way because now you can see 1that there's a lot of pressure over there. 1And then because there is high pressure region over here, 1it automatically wants to move 1towards the low pressure region. 1And the low pressure region is the region 1where there is less concentration of sugars. 1And as a result, the whole sap starts moving 1towards the low concentration region. 1And so this is that step three, which is a bulk flow. 1It starts moving, the whole sap moves 1from higher to lower concentration, 1and now that pressure is relieved. 1And then in step four, the sugars automatically diffuse out 1because outside there is less concentration 1and that can now be taken up by the cell, 1which we will call it as unloading. 1And then finally, 1the excess water drains back into the xylem 1because the concentration has decreased. 1So it goes back 1and that's how translocation works in plants and trees.",science_class-10-biology_in-in-life-processes
" Welcome to my presentation on level three linear, yeah, level three linear equations. [LAUGH] Okay. So let me, let's, let's make up a problem. Let's say I had X plus 2x plus 3 is equal to, minus 7x minus 5. Well, in all of these linear equations, the first things that we, the first thing that we try to do is, get all of our variables on one side of the equation, and then get all of our concept terms on the other side of the equation. And then it actually will become a level one linear equation. So, the first thing we can do is we can try to simplify each of the sides. Well we, on this, on this left side we have this X plus 2x. Well, what is X plus 2x? Well that's like saying I have one apple and now I have two apples. So here I have one X and now I have two more Xs that I'm adding together. So that's equal 3x, 3x plus 3 is equal to minus 7x minus 5. Now let's bring the 7x over onto the left-hand side. And we could do that by adding 7x to both sides, 7x. This is a review. We, we're adding the opposite. So, it's negative 7x, so we add 7x so that's why. And we do that, become the right side, these two will cancel. And the left side, we get 10x plus 3 equals, and on the right side, all we have left is the negative 5. Almost there, now we're at a level, what is this, a level two problem. And now we just have to take this 3 and move it to the other side. And we can do that by subtracting 3 from both sides. That's a 3 minus 3. The left-hand side, the 3s cancel out, that's why we subtract it in the first place. And you have 10x equals and then minus 5 minus 3, well that equals minus 8. Now, we just multiply both sides of this equation by 1 over 10, or the reciprocal of 10, which is the coefficient on x, times 1 over 10. You could also, some people would say, well, we're just dividing both side by 10 which is essential what we're doing. If you divide by 10, that's the same thing as multiplying by 1 over 10. Well, anyway, the left-hand side, 1 over 10 times 10. Well, that equals 1, so we're just left with x equals negative 8 over 10. And that can be reduced further. They both share the common factor 2. So you divide by 2. So it's minus 4 over 5. I think that's right, assuming that I didn't make any careless mistakes. Let's do another problem. Let's say I had 5, that's a 5x minus 3 minus 7x equals x plus 8. And in general if you wanna work this out before I give you how I do it that now's a good time to actually pause the video. And you could, you could try to work it out and then, play it again and, and see what I have to say about it. But assuming you wanna hear it, let me go and do it. So let's do the same thing. We, first of all, we can merge these two Xs on the left-hand side. Remember, you can't add the 5 and the 3 because the 3 is just a constant term while the 5 is 5 times x. But the 5 times x and the negative 7 times actually can merge. So 5, you just add the coefficient. So, it's 5 and negative 7. So, that becomes negative 2x minus 3 is equal to x plus 8. Now, if we wanna take this x that's on the right-hand side and put it over the left-hand side, we can just subtract x from both sides. The left-hand side becomes minus 3x minus 3 is equal to, these two Xs cancel out, is equal to 8. Now, we can just add 3 to both sides to get rid of that constant term 3 on left hand-side. These two 3's will cancel out. And you get minus 3x is equal to 11. Now, you just multiply both sides by negative one-third. And once again, this is just the same thing as dividing both sides by negative 3. And you get x equals negative 11 over 3. Actually let's, let's, just for fun, let's check this just to see. And the cool thing about algebra is if you have enough time, you can always make sure you got the right answer. So we have 5x, so we have 5 times negative 11 over 3. So that's, I'm just, I'm just gonna take this and substitute it back into the original equation. And you might wanna try that out, too. So you have minus 55 over 3, that's just 5 times negative 11 over 3, that's a 3, minus 3. And what's 3? Three could also be written as, minus 9 over 3. I'm skipping some steps, but I think you, you know your fractions pretty good by this point. So that's minus 9 over 3. And then, minus 7x is the same thing, as plus 77 over 3. Because we have the minus 7 times minus 11, so it's plus 77. And, and the equation is saying that should equal minus 11 over 3, that's what x is, plus an 8 is nothing more than 24 over 3. Let's add this up. Minus 55 minus 9, that's minus 64, if I'm right, yeah, that's minus 64. And then, plus 77 minus 64 plus 77 is 13. So the left-hand side becomes 13 over 3. And on the right-hand side minus 11 plus 24, well that's 13 and we still have over 3. So looks like we got the right solution. It checks out. So the correct answer was minus 11 over 3. Hopefully you're ready by now to, do some level three problems. The only thing that makes this a little bit more complicated than level two is you just have to remember to merge the variables in the beginning, and, know that you could subtract variables or constants from both sides. Have fun.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-simple-linear-equations-in-one-variable-icse
" -  We're told that f of x is equal to one over the square root of x plus one, and what we want to figure out is what is the second degree Maclaurin polynomial of f? And like always, pause this video and see if you could have a go at it. so let's remind ourselves what a Maclaurin polynomial is, a Maclaurin polynomial is just a Taylor polynomial centered at zero, so the form of this second degree Maclaurin polynomial, and we just have to find this Maclaurin expansion until our second degree term, it's going to look like this. So p of x, I'm using p for polynomial, it's going to be our f of zero plus, and we could do that as f of zero times x to the zero power, well, that's just f of zero. F of zero plus f prime of zero x, plus f prime prime of zero, divided by, we could think of it as two factorial, but it's really just two, we could think of this as dividing by one factorial, which is just one, this dividing by zero factorial, well that's just one again, so we have f prime prime of zero, the second derivative evaluated zero divided by two, x squared. Now if we wanted a higher degree we could keep on going, but remember, they're just asking us for the second degree. So this is the form that we're gonna need, we're gonna have these three terms. So let's see if we can evaluate the function and its derivatives at zero. So f of zero, f of zero is equal to one over the square root of zero plus one, well that's one over the square root of one, the principle root of one, which is positive one, so that's just going to be equal to one. So that right over there is equal to one. Now let's evaluate f prime of x, and then I'll evaluate f prime of zero. F prime of x is equal to, well, one over the square root of x plus one, this is the same thing as x plus one, let me write it this way, this is the same thing as, actually let me write it down this way. Another way of writing f of x is this is the same thing as x plus one to the negative one half. And so if I'm thinking the first derivative of f, well, I could use the chain rule here, the derivative of x plus one with respect to x, well, that's just going to be one, and then I'll take the derivative of this whole thing with respect to x plus one and I'll just use the power rule there, this is gonna be negative one half, times x plus one, to the, and I decrement the exponent, negative three halves. And so the first derivative evaluated of zero is just negative one half, times, if this is zero, zero plus one is just one, one to the negative three halves, one to the negative three half power, well, that's just going to be one. So this whole thing, f prime of zero is just negative one half. So that is this right over here is negative one half. And now let's figure out the second derivative. All right, let me do this in this green color. So the second derivative with respect to x, well I did the same thing again, the derivative of x plus one with respect to x, that's just one, so I just have to take the derivative of the whole thing with respect to x plus one. So I take my exponent, bring it out front, negative three halves times one half, times negative one half, is going to be positive three fourths times x plus one, and then I decrement the exponent here by one, or by two halves, so that's gonna be negative five halves, and so the second derivative evaluated at zero, well if this is equal to zero you're gonna have one to the negative five halves which is just one, times three fourths, is gonna be three fourths. So this part right over here is three fourths. And so you're gonna have three fourths divided by two, three fourths divided by two is three eighths. So our Taylor, I should say, our Maclaurin polynomial, our second degree Maclaurin polynomial, p of x is going to be equal to, and I'll do it in the same colors, going to be equal to one, plus, maybe I'll just write it as minus one half, minus one half x, plus three eighths x squared, plus three eighths x squared, and we are done, there you have it. We have our second degree Maclaurin polynomial of f, which could be used to provide an approximation for our function, especially if our x is near zero.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-series-new
" Rewrite the following equation in logarithmic form. So they wrote 100 is equal to 10 to the second power. So if we wanna write the same information, really, in logarithmic form, we could say that the power that I need to raise 10 to to get to 100 is equal to 2, or log base 10 of 100 is equal to 2. Notice these are equivalent statements. This is just in exponential form. This is is logarithmic form. This is saying that the power I need to raise 10 to to get to 100 is equal to 2. Which is the same thing as saying that 10 to the 2nd power is 100. 10 to the second power is 100. And the way that I specify the base is by doing this underscore right over here. So underscore 10, log base 10 of 100 is equal to 2. Here they ask us to rewrite the following equation in exponential form. So this is log base 5 of 1 over 125 is equal to negative 3. This is one way to think about it is saying the power that I need to raise 5 to to get to 1 over 125 is equal to negative 3 or that 5 to the negative 3 power is equal to 1 over 125. And we can verify that this has formatted it the right way. 5 to the negative 3 power is 1 over 125. The exact same truth about the universe, just in different forms. Logarithmic form and exponential form. So let me check my answer and make sure I got it right. And I did.",math_algebra2_logs
" We know that when we have some substance in a liquid state, it has enough kinetic energy for the molecules to move past each other, but still not enough energy for the molecules to completely move away from each other. So, for example, this is a liquid. Maybe they're moving in that direction. These guys are moving a little bit slower in that direction so there's a bit of this flow going on, but still there are bonds between them. They kind of switch between different molecules, but they want to stay close to each other. There are these little bonds between them and they want to stay close. If you increase the average kinetic energy enough, or essentially increase the temperature enough and then overcome the heat of fusion, we know that, all of a sudden, even these bonds aren't strong enough to even keep them close, and the molecules separate and they get into a gaseous phase. And there they have a lot of kinetic energy, and they're bouncing around, and they take the shape of their container. But there's an interesting thing to think about. Temperature is average kinetic energy. Which implies, and it's true, that all of the molecules do not have the same kinetic energy. Let's say even they did. Then these guys would bump into this guy, and you could think of them as billiard balls, and they transfer all of the momentum to this guy. Now this guy has a ton of kinetic energy. These guys have a lot less. This guy has a ton. These guys have a lot less. There's a huge distribution of kinetic energy. If you look at the surface atoms or the surface molecules, and I care about the surface molecules because those are the first ones to vaporize or-- I shouldn't jump the gun. They're the ones capable of leaving if they had enough kinetic energy. If I were to draw a distribution of the surface molecules-- let me draw a little graph here. So in this dimension, I have kinetic energy, and on this dimension, this is just a relative concentration. And this is just my best estimate, but it should give you the idea. So there's some average kinetic energy at some temperature, right? This is the average kinetic energy. And then the kinetic energy of all the parts, it's going to be a distribution around that, so maybe it looks something like this: a bell curve. You could watch the statistics videos to learn more about the normal distribution, but I think the normal distribution-- this is supposed to be a normal, so it just gets smaller and smaller as you go there. And so at any given time, although the average is here, there's some molecules that have a very low kinetic energy. They're moving slowly or maybe they have-- well, let's just say they're moving slowly. And at any given time, you have some molecules that have a very high kinetic energy, maybe just because of the random bumps that it gets from other molecules. It's accrued a lot of velocity or at least a lot of momentum. So the question arises, are any of these molecules fast enough? Do they have enough kinetic energy to escape? And so there is some kinetic energy. I'll draw some threshold here, where if you have more than that amount of kinetic energy, you actually have enough to escape if you are surface atom. Now, there could be a dude down here who has a ton of kinetic energy. But in order for him to escape, he'd have to bump through all these other liquid molecules on the way out, so it's a very-- in fact, he probably won't escape. It's the surface atoms that we care about because those are the ones that are interfacing directly with the pressure outside. So let's say this is the gas outside. It's going to be much less dense. It doesn't have to be, but let's assume it is. These are the guys that kind of can escape into the air above it, if we assume that there's some air above it. So at any given time, there's some fraction of the particles or the molecules that can escape. So you're next question is, hey, well, doesn't that mean that they will be vaporized or they will turn into gas? And yes, it does. So at any given time, you have some molecules that are escaping. Those molecules-- what it's called is evaporation. This isn't a foreign concept to you. If you leave water outside, it will evaporate, even though outside, hopefully, in your place, is below the boiling temperature, or the normal boiling temperature of water. The normal boiling point is just the boiling point at atmospheric pressure. If you just leave water out, over time, it will evaporate. What happens is some of these molecules that have unusually high kinetic energy do escape. They do escape, and if you have your pot or pan outside or, even better, outside of your house, what happens is they escape, and then the wind blows. The wind will blow and then blow these guys away. And then a few more will escape, the wind blows and blows them all away. And a few more escape, and the wind blows and blows them all the way. So over time, you'll end up with an empty pan that once held water. Now, the question is what happens if you have a closed system? Well, we've all done that experiment, either on purpose or inadvertently, leaving something outside and seeing that the water will evaporate. What happens in a closed system where there isn't wind to blow away? So let me just draw-- there you go. Let's say a closed system, and I have-- it doesn't have to be water, but I have some liquid down here. And there's some pressure from the air above it. Let's just say it was at atmospheric pressure. It doesn't have to be. So there's some air and the air has some kinetic energy over here. So, of course, do the water molecules. And some of them start to evaporate. So some of the water molecules that are up here in the distribution, they have enough energy to escape, so they start hanging out with the air molecules, right? Now something interesting happens. This is the distribution of the molecules in the liquid state. Well, there's also a distribution of the kinetic energies of the molecules in the gaseous state. Just like different things are bumping into each other and gaining and losing kinetic energy down here, the same thing is happening up here. So maybe this guy has a lot of kinetic energy, but he bumps into stuff and he loses it. And then he'll come back down. So there's some set of molecules. I'll do it in another set of blue. These are still the water-- or whatever the fluid we're talking about-- that come back from the vapor state back into the liquid state. And so what happens is, there's always a bit of evaporation and there's always a bit of condensation because you always have this distribution of kinetic energies. At any given moment in time, out of the vapor above the liquid, some of the vapor loses its kinetic energy and then it goes back into the liquid state. Some of the surface liquid gains kinetic energy by random bumps and whatever else and goes into the vapor state. And the vapor state will continue to happen until you get to some type of equilibrium. And when you get that equilibrium, we're at some pressure up here. So let me see, some pressure. And the pressure is caused by these vapor particles over here, and that pressure is called the vapor pressure. I want to make sure you understand this. So the vapor pressure is the pressure created, and this is at a given temperature for a given molecule, right? Every molecule or every type of substance will have a different vapor pressure at different temperatures, and obviously every different type of substance will also have different vapor pressures. For a given temperature and a given molecule, it's the pressure at which you have a pressure created by the vapor molecules where you have an equilibrium. Where you have just as many things vaporizing as things going back into the liquid state. And we learned before that the more pressure you have, the harder it is to vaporize even more, right? We learned in the phase state things that if you are at 100 degrees at ultra-high pressure, and you were dealing with water, you would still be in the liquid state. So the vapor creates some pressure and it'll keep happening, depending on how badly this liquid wants to evaporate. But it keeps vaporizing until the point that you have just as much-- I guess you could kind of view it as density up here, but I don't want to think-- you have just as many molecules here converting into this state as molecules here converting into this state. So just to get an intuition of what vapor pressure is or how it goes with different molecules, molecules that really want to evaporate-- and so why would a molecule want to evaporate? It could have high kinetic energy, so this would be at a high temperature. It could have low intermolecular forces, right? It could be molecular. Obviously, the noble gases have very low molecular forces, but in general, most hydrocarbons or gasoline or methane or all of these things, they really want to evaporate because they have much lower intermolecular forces than, say, water. Or they could just be light molecules. You could look at the physics lectures, but kinetic energy it's a function of mass and velocity. So you could have a pretty respectable kinetic energy because you have a high mass and a low velocity. So if you have a light mass and the same kinetic energy, you're more likely to have a higher velocity. You could watch the kinetic energy videos for that. But something that wants to evaporate, a lot of its molecules-- let me do it in a different color. 1Something that wants to evaporate really bad, a lot 1more of its molecules will have to enter into this vapor 1state in order for the equilibrium to be reached. 1Let me do it all in the same color. 1So the pressure created by its evaporated molecules is going 1to be higher for it to get to that equilibrium state, so it 1has high vapor pressure. 1And on the other side, if you're at a low temperature or 1you have strong intermolecular forces or you have a heavy 1molecule, then you're going to have a low vapor pressure. 1For example, iron has a very low vapor pressure because 1it's not vaporizing while-- let me think of something. 1Carbon dioxide has a relatively much 1higher vapor pressure. 1Much more of carbon dioxide is going to evaporate 1when you have it. 1Well, I really shouldn't use that because you're going 1straight from the liquid to the solid state, but I think 1you get the idea. 1And something that has a high vapor pressure, that wants to 1evaporate really bad, we say it has a high volatility. 1You've probably heard that word before. 1So, for example, gasoline has a higher-- it's more volatile 1than water, and that's why it evaporates, and it also has a 1higher vapor pressure. 1Because if you were to put it in a closed container, more 1gasoline at the same temperature and the same 1atmospheric pressure, will enter into the vapor state. 1And so that vapor state will generate more pressure to 1offset the natural inclination of the gasoline to want to 1escape than in the case with water. 1Now, an interesting thing happens when this vapor 1pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure. 1So right now, this is our closed container and you have 1the atmosphere here at a certain pressure. 1Let's say until now, we've assumed that the atmosphere 1was at a higher pressure, for the most part keeping these 1molecules contained. 1Maybe some atmosphere molecules are coming in here, 1and maybe some of the vapor molecules are escaping a bit, 1but it's keeping it contained because this is at a higher 1pressure out here than this vapor pressure. 1And of course the pressure right here, at the surface of 1the molecule, is going to be the combination of the partial 1pressure due to the few atmospheric molecules that 1come in, plus the vapor pressure. 1But once that vapor pressure becomes equal to that 1atmospheric pressure, so it can press out with the same 1amount of force-- you can kind of view it as force per area-- 1so then the molecules can start to escape. 1It can push the atmosphere back. 1And so you start having a gap here. 1You start having a vacuum. 1I don't want to use exactly a vacuum, but since the 1molecules escaped, more and more of these molecules can 1start going out. 1And at that point, you've reached the boiling point of 1the substance when the vapor pressure is equal to the 1atmospheric pressure. 1Just to get a sense of what all of this means, let's look 1at the vapor pressure for water. 1This is water right here, H2O. 1I should do that in black. 1And so you see at 760-- so atmospheric pressure, we're in 1torr now, but that's just a different-- 760 torr is equal 1to 1 atmosphere, so that's about right. 1That's about right there, so it's 1 atmosphere. 1So at atmospheric pressure, the vapor pressure at 100 1degrees Celsius for water-- the vapor is at 100 degrees 1Celsius for water. 1Or I guess another way to put it, at 100 degrees Celsius, 1you have 760 torr of vapor pressure, which is exactly the 1atmospheric pressure, or 1 atmosphere, at sea level. 1So at 100 degrees, vapor pressure is equal to 1atmospheric, or sea level atmospheric. 1And so you're going to boil, which we all know is true. 1And then at lower temperatures, your vapor 1pressure is going to be lower than the 1atmospheric pressure, right? 1Let's see, here it looks like 300 something. 1But then what happens? 1If you lowered the atmospheric pressure enough, if you were 1to pump air out of the container, or whatever, low 1enough, so if you brought the atmospheric pressure down to 1this vapor pressure, then again, you will have boiling. 1And we saw that in the phase change diagrams, that you can 1boil something at a lower temperature if you lower the 1atmospheric pressure. 1And that's because you're lowering the atmospheric 1pressure to the vapor pressure of the substance. 1And here's a comparative chart, and this is 1interesting. 1You see this is kind of an exponential increase with 1temperature of vapor pressure. 1And that's because, if you think about that distribution 1we did before, this is at one kinetic energy. 1If you increase the amount of kinetic energy, then your 1distribution will look like this. 1The temperature has gone up. 1And now you have a lot, lot more. 1It's not just linear. 1You have a lot more particles that can now escape and have 1the kinetic energy to evaporate. 1And you can see it's this exponential increase as you 1increase the temperature. 1Now, here's another chart. 1You say, hey, where's that exponential increase going? 1That's because this is a logarithmic chart. 1You can see the scale. 1It increases exponentially as opposed to linearly, so it 1goes from 0.1 to 10, so equal distances are actually up by a 1factor of 10, so that's why you don't see 1that logarithmic move. 1But these are just for different substances. 1Propane, you see at any given-- so let's go at like a 1decent temperature. 1Let's go 20 degrees Celsius. 1At 20 Celsius, propane has the highest vapor pressure. 1So this is 1 atmosphere, so propane will actually 1evaporate, will actually boil at 20 degrees Celsius. 1It will actually completely boil and go 1into the gaseous state. 1Because its vapor pressure is so much higher than 1atmospheric pressure, if we're assuming we're at sea level. 1And you could do that for different molecules. 1Methyl chloride is the next one. 1It's a slightly lower vapor pressure, 1but still very volatile. 1It would still definitely boil and turn into the gaseous 1state at 20 degrees Celsius if we're at sea level because sea 1level is right there. 1Let's see, at sea level, if you wanted to keep something-- 1so sea level is this pressure-- if you wanted to 1keep let's say, methyl chloride. 1If you wanted to keep methyl chloride in the liquid state, 1or in equilibrium with the liquid state instead of 1boiling, you would have to be at least at 1around-- what is this? 1Minus 25 degrees Celsius in order for that. 1Propane, even at minus 25 degrees is still in the 1gaseous state because its vapor 1pressure is still higher. 1And then, of course, if you have butane, for example. 1Butane I think is what they put in lighters, but butane 1will be in the liquid state as long as you're at around 1roughly 0 degrees. 1In a lighter, you might say, oh, it's in a liquid state. 1They probably increase the pressure so the pressure in 1the lighter is probably something higher. 1Maybe it's at 2 atmospheres or something, so that the butane 1at room temperature will stay in the liquid state. 1Who knows? 1I don't know what the pressure is in there. 1This is just an interesting chart to look at, that there's 1actually a bunch of different vapor pressures. 1You can see at atmospheric pressure what's likely to be a 1gas or a liquid at different temperatures, and then you 1could see at different temperatures, which are the 1things that are most volatile and how much do you have to 1increase or decrease the pressure to evaporate 1something or to boil it. 1Anyway, hopefully you found that useful. 1Vapor pressure is something that we encounter every day, 1and I'll see you in the next video.",science_ap-chemistry_states-of-matter-and-intermolecular-forces-ap
" - [Tutor] What we're going to do in this video is see if we can solve the differential equation, the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to x times y, pause this video and see if you can find a general solution here. So the first thing that my brain likes to do, when I see a differential equation is to say, hey, is this separable and when I say separable, can I get all the ys and dys on one side and all the xs and dxs on the other side? And you can indeed do that, if we treat our differentials like, if we could treat 'em like algebraic variables, which is fair game, when you're dealing with differential equations like this, we could multiple both sides by dx, so multiple both sides by dx and we could divide both sides by y, let me move this over a little bit, so we have some space, so we could also multiple both sides by one over y, one over y and so what that does is these dxs cancel out and this y and one over y cancels out and we are left with, let me write all the things in terms of y on the left-hand side in blue, so we have one over you dy is equal to, and then I'll do all this stuff in orange, we have is equal to, we're just left with an x and a dx, x dx and then we'll wanna take the indefinite integral of both sides, now what's the anti-derivative of one over y? Well, if we want it in the most general form, this would be the natural log of the absolute value of y and then this is going to be equal to the anti-derivative of x is x squared over two and then we wanna put a constant on either side, I'll just put it on the right-hand side, plus C, this ensures that we're dealing with the general solution, now if we wanna solve explicitly for y, we could raise e to both sides' power, another way to think about it is, if this is equal to that, then e to this power is going to be the same thing as e to that power, now, what does that do for us? Well, what is e to the natural log of the absolute value of y? Well, I'm raising e to the power that I would have to raise e too to to get to the absolute value of y, so the left-hand side here, it simplifies to the absolute value of y and we get that as being equal to, now, we could use our exponent properties, this over here is the same thing as e to the x squared over two times e to the C times e to the C, I am just using our exponent properties here, well, e to the C, we could just view that as some other type of constant, this is just sum constant C, so we could rewrite this whole thing as C e to the x squared x squared over two, hopefully you see what I'm doing there, I just use my exponent properties e dah dah dah, sum of two things is equal to e to the first thing times e to the second thing and I just said, well, e to the power of sum constant C, we could just relabel that as, let's call that our blue C and so this simplifies to blue C times e to the x squared over two, now we saw this absolute value sign here, so this essentially means that y could be equal to, we could write it this way, y could be equal to plus or minus C, C e to the x squared over two, x squared over two, but once again, we don't know what this constant is, I didn't say that it was positive or negative, so when you see a plus or minus of a constant here, you could really just subsume all of this, I'll just call this red C, so we could say that y is equal to, I'll just rewrite it over again for fun, y is equal to red C, not the Red Sea, but a red C (laughs) times e to the x squared over two, this right over here, it's the general solution to the original, separable differential equation.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-diff-equations
" Let's graph another rational function, because you really can't get enough practice here. So let's say we have y is equal to x over x squared minus x minus 6. So the first thing we might want to do is just factor this denominator so we can identify our vertical asymptotes, if there are any. So what two numbers when I take their product I get negative 6 and if I add them up I get negative 1? So they have to be of different signs. So one's going to be a plus and one-- let me write my x's a little bit neater than that-- so one is going to be a positive and one is going to be a negative. A 2 and a 3 seem to be pretty close, because they're one apart, and I'm going to subtract the larger number because when I add them, I get a negative. So x minus 3 times x plus 2 seems to work. That gets negative 6. Negative 3x plus 2x. negative 3 times x plus 2 times x is negative x, so that works. So this is equal to x over x plus 2 times x minus 3. And like we saw in the last video, since these expressions, since the x plus 2 doesn't cancel out with anything in the numerator and the x minus 3 doesn't cancel out with anything in the numerator, we know that these can be used to find our vertical asymptotes. The vertical asymptotes are when either that term is equal to zero or when that term is equal to zero, because at those points, our equation is undefined. So this is equal to zero when x is equal to negative 2, and this is equal to zero when x is equal to positive 3. And you could try it out here. If x is equal to negative 2 or positive 3, you're going to get a zero in the denonminator, y will be undefined. So vertical asymptotes at x is equal to negative 2. So there's a vertical asymptote, a vertical asymptote right there. Another vertical asymptote is x is equal to 3. One, two, three. There is our other vertical asymptote. Now let's think about horizontal asymptotes, or if there are any. So what happens as x gets super-positive or super-negative? And as we said before, you just have to look at the highest degree term on the numerator and the highest degree term on the denominator. Now, notice the highest degree term on the denominator is x squared, while the highest degree term on the numerator is only an x. So when x gets really large, what's going to happen? You could imagine, this is going to be like a million over a million squared, which is still one over a million. These terms over here don't matter much. But this term right here is going to grow faster than everything. This is an x squared term. As x gets large, it's going to get way larger than everything, including this term on the top, so it's essentially going to go to zero. When the denominator just gets bigger, faster than the numerator as you're going to approach zero. So we have a horizontal asymptote at y is equal to 0. I could draw it as a dotted line over our x-axis. So that right there is the line, y is equal to 0. Once again, we identify that looking at the highest degree term there. The denominator has a higher-degree term, so it's going to grow faster than the numerator. You could try it out on your calculator. And that's true whether you go in the super-negative direction or the super-positive direction. This thing is going to overwhelm this thing up here, the denominator grows faster than the numerator, which essentially we're going to approach zero. You're going to get smaller and smaller fractions. Just remember, 1/10 and then-- let me actually just-- as x gets larger and larger and larger, what's going to happen? Let me just show you on my calculator. Let's say x is equal to 10. 10 divided by 10 squared minus 10, and normally you wouldn't have to do this. I just really want to show you the intuition. Whoops! I'm not trying to graph. Let me exit from here. So if we have 10 over 10 squared minus 10, once again, you normally wouldn't have to do this. I just want to show you, give you the intuition. Let me put some parentheses there. Let me put some parentheses over here. So let me insert the parentheses there and put a parentheses over here. You get a small number. What happens if x gets even larger? Let me make, instead of a 10, let me make it all 100. Let me make these tens into hundreds, into 100. Insert 100 there, what do we get? We get even a smaller number. And if you try x is equal to 1,000, it's going to be be even smaller than that. That's because this term right here is growing faster than every single other term. That's why our horizontal asymptote is y is equal to 0. Now, the last thing we want to do, we've drawn all of our asymptotes, is just try out some points. So let's draw like a little table here. There's our table. When x is equal to 0, what is y? x is 0, we have 0 over all of this. 0 minus 6, 0 over negative 6 is just 0. When x is equal to-- I don't know, let's just try when x is equal to 1, what do we have? We have 1 over-- I'll write it here. 1 over 1 squared minus 1. Now that's just 0, so we have negative 6. When x is equal to negative 1, what do we have? When x is equal to negative 1, we have negative 1 over negative 1 squared, which is 1 minus negative 1. So that's plus 1-- right, minus negative 1-- minus 6. So what is this right here? This is negative 1, so this is going to be negative 1 over 2 minus 6 over negative 4. This is going to be equal to 1/4, so we're going to get a positive value. So we have-- let me draw this-- negative 1, we're at 1/4 right here. That's about right there. I'll do it in a darker color. We had the point 0, 0, and then at x is equal to 1, we had negative 1/6. So you could keep graphing more and more points, but it looks like as we approach this vertical asymptote from the right, we go to positive infinity. And that should make sense. Let's see, if we were to put in-- we're approaching negative 2 from the right. So if you were to put in negative 1.9999999, this term is going to be a very small positive number. This term's going to be a negative number. This term's going to be negative number. The negatives cancel out. You have a very small positive number in the denominator. 1 over that gives you a very positive number. Now, as we approach the other vertical asymptote from the left, we're going to go super-negative. My gut tells me that because when I tried x is equal to 1, I already went to a negative value. But you could imagine if you did 2.99999, right? Let me draw that a little bit better. You get the idea. If x is equal to 2.999, so we get really close to the asymptote, this is going to be positive, this is going to be negative, that's going to be positive, and this is going to be a small number. So you're going to have 1 over a very small negative number, which is a very, I guess, negative number. It's a negative of 1 over a very small number, so you're going to approach negative infinity. Now, let's try some point out here to see what happens. So what happens when x is equal to 4? When x is equal to 4, you have 4 over 16 minus 4 minus 6. What is that? That's 16 minus 10. That is 6. So this is equal to 4/6, which is equal to 2/3. So the point 4, 2/3 is here, so one, two, three, four. 2/3, just like that. So that gives me the sense, look, I have to approach this horizontal asymptote as we go further and further out. We're going to probably approach positive infinity like this. Let me draw it a little neater than that. Like that. You get the idea. Then over here, we're going to get closer and closer to our horizontal asymptote as we approach infinity. This should be a smoother-looking curve right around there. I'm making a mess here. This should be a smoother-looking curve. You get the idea, I think. Now, let's see what happens when x is equal to negative 3. So when x is equal to negative 3, we have negative 3 over negative 3 squared, which is 9 minus negative 3, so that's plus 3 minus 6. So what is this equal to? This is equal to negative 3 over-- this is 12 minus 6 over 6, right, which is equal to negative 1/2, So negative 3, negative 1/2. Negative 1/2 is right there. So we're going to approach this asymptote as we get 1really negative. 1And we're probably going to go straight down like that as we 1approach this vertical asymptote right there. 1And you could try more points if you don't believe me. 1But let us graph it just to verify it for ourselves. 1So our equation is x divided by x squared minus x minus 6. 1And let's graph it. 1And there you go. 1There you go. 1All right, looks pretty good. 1Our asymptote is zero, we go down. 1Vertical asymptote, bam! 1Go up there, then we go back down here, then we go just 1like that again. 1So once again, this looks just about exactly what we got. 1Obviously, the graphing calculator, it kind of a 1pitters out as you get close to these values and it does 1weird things, but it has the same general shape. 1We could actually close the range a little bit if we want, 1if we want to graph it. 1Let's make our x minimum value, let's make it 5. 1And let's take our x maximum value, let's 1make that 5 as well. 1We're kind of zooming in a little bit. 1So let's graph it now. 1Bam! 1bam! 1There you go! 1It's the same shape as we graphed right here. 1Hopefully, you found that satisfying.",math_algebra2_rational
" -  Look at all these giant trees standing tall and mighty. When I used to look at them, I used to wonder about one question. How do these trees take up water from the ground and push it all the way to the top against the force of gravity? I mean think about it. Some of the trees can grow hundreds of meters tall. So, how do they get that water all the way to the top? The answer is evaporation, that's right. It turns out and this blew my mind away when I learned about this, it turns out more than 95% of the water that they absorb just evaporates into the atmosphere. But doesn't that sound crazy to you? I mean how can evaporation make water go up and what's the whole point? I mean if they are evaporating most of that water, why do they even need water? What's going on? Well, let's find out. Now, before we dive into this, let's back up a little bit. We have seen before that plants and trees can grow so tall because they have evolved pipe like structures within them which are called vascular tissues. They help in transporting the food and water from one part of the body to another. And since we have to transport two things, food and water, there are two separate kind of pipes. One is called xylem which transports mostly water and some dissolved minerals and the other one is called phloem which mostly transports food, f for food, ph for phloem. Now, if you seem to be pretty unfamiliar with these fancy names then we've talked a lot about them in a previous video called intro to vascular tissues. Be great idea to go back and watch that as a refresher. If you feel you're confident, let's go ahead then. So, in this video, since you wanna talk about water we're going to be focusing only on xylem and see how it works. Now, when I was studying about this even before thinking about water, my main question was, where do these pipes come from, right? I mean how did they get there? Turns out that they come from modified cells. For example let's think about how xylem is formed. Well, here's how we like to think about it. So, before xylem was formed we had normal plant cells but as they mature they start losing all of this stuff from inside. They start losing their nucleus, their mitochondria, their cytoplasm, all of that is gone and eventually they lose even these horizontal cell walls as well and all the vertical cell walls join together to form a tall empty pipe, that's our xylem. And since it's empty we can now fill it up with water. And so this might make you wonder, if these cells have lost all of their organelles how are they staying alive. The answer is they aren't. They're all dead. And so important to remember that xylem is made of dead cells, they're no longer alive and just to contrast it turns out that phloem is made of living cells. We'll get to that in another video as to why and how but xylem is made of dead cells. And so now to the big question, how does the water climb up these xylem vessels? Well, like I said before it's due to evaporation. When the water eventually reaches all the cells of the leaves, most of them go out of the tiny pores which are present in these leaves. You might know the names of these pores, they're called stomata. They're useful in exchanging gases. When the stomata opens up, the water gets evaporated in to the atmosphere. But how does this evaporation help in pushing the water up? Well, to figure that out, let's zoom into one of these leaves. So, let's say that this is that same xylem tissue that we just talked about made of dead cells and let's say this is one of the leaves, highly magnified view you imagine and this is one of those pores the stomata through which the water can go out. Now, if we draw some of the water molecules, imagine these are individual molecules of water. I know they seem too big. Molecules are not so big but imagine, okay. And so these are the water molecules that are moving out of the leaves. It turns out that these molecules pretty strongly attract other molecules as well and as a result when these molecules move out they automatically start pulling on the molecules behind them. You'll learn in chemistry that this force is called the hydrogen bonding, okay but don't worry about the names as of now. So, because of this attraction they pull on the molecules behind and as a result these start moving away and then they start pulling on the ones behind them and they start moving on the ones behind them. And so can you see that because of this the force, this pulling force starts from the leaves and goes all the way down to the roots because this is a single column of water, a giant very tall column of water and that's how the force gets transmitted. This is kind of like how she's drinking that juice from the straw. She's sucking on that straw and the juice comes up. Similarly, you can imagine the xylem to be a giant straw. The evaporation causes that suction because of which the water gets pulled up. And so because there's a lot of suction force within the xylem, the walls of the xylem tissue needs to be super thick, thick enough to withstand that force. Now, what do you mean by that? For example, just look at this water bottle. When I start sucking on it look at how easily the walls collapse. There is a similar suction over here but way stronger and so the walls need to be strong enough to not collapse. And so xylem has pretty strong walls because of which it also acts like a backbone to the plants and the trees. And if you're wondering, wood is made of xylem. In fact, the word xylem comes from the Greek xylon which means wood. So, the wood that is used in the furnitures and tables and everything were once a part of this amazing water conducting system. Pretty awesome, right? But you might be thinking, why do plants have to go through all this trouble to suck that water and then just make it evaporate? Why are they doing it in the first place? Well, for many reasons. First of all, they need some of that water. They don't throw all of it away. Some of that water is useful in photosynthesis. But more importantly this running stream of water helps in transporting the minerals, the important minerals from the soil to all the cells of the plant. So, this water acts like a train where the minerals hop in at the soil and then when they reach their destination at the leaves they get absorbed, the water gets thrown away and the process repeats. So, it's because of this the the trees get the important minerals because of which they can grow. And if that's not enough evaporation is also useful in cooling them down just like how when you go out in a hot sun you start sweating because when that sweat evaporates your body gets cooled down. In a similar manner, these trees and plants are always in the hot sun during the daytime. So, they need to cool off as well and so instead of sweat they just evaporate these water and that helps them cool down. And so you can see evaporation is a big deal for these plants and trees. It's such a big deal that scientists thought, let's give it a different name altogether. So, the evaporation that happens in the trees from their plants, from the stomata, it's called transpiration. Okay, transpiration. And why is this transpiration useful? Because it causes suction force. So, it causes suction because of which the water gets pulled up and all the minerals get transported and also it causes cooling, this is called evaporative cooling. Both of these are essential and that's how xylem pretty much works. But if you're really curious, you might ask one final question. What happens during the night time? Because transpiration requires heat which you can get during the daytime but during night time there's hardly any transpiration. So, what keeps that column of water up and running? Why doesn't it just fall down? That's because there is a second force that is causing this water to go up. This force originates from the roots itself, it's called the root pressure because it comes from the roots and it's this force that makes sure during the night time the column just doesn't fall down. So, there are both forces acting. There's a suction force due to transpiration and there is this root pressure. During the daytime, the transpiration dominates but during the nighttime because there is no transpiration, root pressure is the only force. But how does that work? Well, to quickly give you an overview, here we have zoomed in to the tip of one of the tiny root hairs. And what you're seeing over here is the water and these dots represent minerals. So, we have water and dissolved minerals in the soil and we also have water and dissolved minerals in these root hairs. And the concentration is pretty much even because diffusion makes sure of that. 1But now the cells of these root hairs 1start messing with the concentration balance. 1They start absorbing the minerals from their surrounding. 1So, look at the minerals carefully. 1They start absorbing it from the soil 1and this cannot happen all by itself, 1the cells need to spend energy to bring those minerals in. 1And because of that it's called an active process 1or an active transport. 1Active means they're using energy to transport the minerals 1inside their cells. 1And now look at what has happened. 1Because the soil lost the minerals, 1this solution has become dilute 1because there's a lot of water but there's less minerals 1and the solution inside the root has become concentrated, 1more concentrated than outside. 1And nature does not like that, nature needs balance. 1So, either the minerals have to flow back out 1but the cells don't allow that, 1they use energy to make sure that doesn't happen. 1But if that can't happen, you know what nature does? 1It makes sure that the water starts going in, 1the water starts rushing in. 1Think about it. 1Because the outside region is more dilute, 1the water moves out from that 1and enters the more concentrated region. 1It starts diluting this as well. 1And in the process notice the water starts rushing in. 1You may have heard of this process. 1This process is called osmosis. 1It's a special kind of diffusion in which 1particles don't move from higher concentration 1to lower concentration but instead the water starts moving 1from lower concentration to higher concentration. 1but the idea is the same 1to balance the concentration. 1And as a result of this osmosis, 1now can you see that because water is rushing in 1it starts pushing on the column of the water 1that's already present over here 1and that's what causes the pressure from the bottom. 1This is called the root pressure. 1Let me just write that down. 1This pressure is called root pressure. 1And in more general because it is happening due to osmosis 1you can also call this as the osmotic pressure. 1And so this root pressure forces the water to go up as well. 1It's not as strong as their suction produced 1due to transpiration but during the night time 1this is the only available force. 1So, this makes sure that the column doesn't fall down. 1And that's pretty much it. 1So, to quickly summarize, what did we learn in this video? 1We saw that xylem tissues are made of dead cells 1which help in transporting water up 1and it happens due to two forces. 1One is the transpiration in which the water evaporates 1and causes suction 1which literally sucks the water from the roots. 1And we saw that transpiration also helps 1in cooling the plants off. 1And the second pressure is the root pressure. 1This is where the roots are actively absorbing the minerals, 1increasing the concentration and thereby causing osmosis. 1And so this continuous upstream of water makes sure 1that every single cell gets the required minerals 1from the soil and helps recycle the water from the ground 1into the atmosphere.",science_class-10-biology_in-in-life-processes
" We're given a system of equations here, and we're told to solve for x and y. Now, the easiest thing to do here, since in both equations they're explicitly solved for y, is say, well, if y is equal to that, and y also has to equal this second equation, then why don't we just set them equal to each other? Or another way to think about it is, if y is equal to this whole thing right over here-- that's what that first equation is telling us-- and if we have to find an x and a y that satisfy both of these equations, if y is equal to that, why can't I just substitute that right here for y? And if we do that, the left-hand side of this bottom equation becomes negative 1/4x plus 100. And then that is going to be equal to this right-hand side-- and I'll do it in the same color-- is equal to negative 1/4x plus 120. Now, the first thing we might want to do is maybe get all of our x terms onto the left- or the right-hand side of the equation. And if we wanted to get rid of these x terms from the right-hand side, get them on the left-hand side, the best thing to do is to add 1/4x to both sides of this equation. So let me do that. So we're going to add 1/4x here, add 1/4x here, and you might already be sensing that something shady is going on. So let's do it. So negative 1/4x plus 1/4x. They cancel out. You get 0x. So the left side of the equation is just 100. And then the right side of the equation, same thing. Negative 1/4x plus 1/4x. They cancel out. No x's. And you're just left with is equal to 120. Which we know is definitely not the case. 100 is not equal to 120. We got this nonsensical equation here, that 100 equals 120. So this type of system has no solution. You know it has no solution because in order for it to have any solution, these two numbers would have to be equal to each other, and they are not equal to each other. And if you look at the original equations, it might jump out at you why they have no solutions. Both of these lines, or both of these equations, if you view them as lines, have the exact same slope. But they have different y-intercepts. So if I just were to do a really quick graph here. That's my y-axis, that is my x-axis, so it's y and x. This first graph over here, its y-intercept is 100. Let me do it a little bit lower. Its y-intercept-- let's say that that is 100, so it intersects right there. And there's a slope of negative 1/4. So maybe it looks something like this. That's that first line. This second line-- I'll do it in pink right here-- y is equal to negative 1/4x plus 120, its y-intercept might be right here at 120. But it has the same slope, negative 1/4, so its slope, the line would look something like this. So you see that there are no x and y points that satisfy both of these equations. Another way to think about it. If y-- you take an x. This first equation says, OK, you take your x, multiply it by negative 1/4, and add 100, and that's going to give you y. Now, here we say, well, you take that same x, and you multiply it by negative 1/4 and add 120, and that has to be equal to y. Well, the only way that that would ever be true is if 100 and 120 were the same number, and they're not the same number. So you're never going to have a solution of this system. These two lines are never going to intersect, and that's because they have the exact same slope.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-systems-topic
" In the video on electronegativity, we learned how to determine whether a covalent bond is polar or nonpolar. In this video, we're going to see how we figure out whether molecules are polar or nonpolar and also how to apply that polarity to what we call intermolecular forces. Intermolecular forces are the forces that are between molecules. And so that's different from an intramolecular force, which is the force within a molecule. So a force within a molecule would be something like the covalent bond. And an intermolecular force would be the force that are between molecules. And so let's look at the first intermolecular force. It's called a dipole-dipole interaction. And let's analyze why it has that name. If I look at one of these molecules of acetone here and I focus in on the carbon that's double bonded to the oxygen, I know that oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. And so we have four electrons in this double bond between the carbon and the oxygen. So I'll try to highlight them right here. And since oxygen is more electronegative, oxygen is going to pull those electrons closer to it, therefore giving oxygen a partial negative charge. Those electrons in yellow are moving away from this carbon. So the carbon's losing a little bit of electron density, and this carbon is becoming partially positive like that. And so for this molecule, we're going to get a separation of charge, a positive and a negative charge. So we have a polarized double bond situation here. We also have a polarized molecule. And so there's two different poles, a negative and a positive pole here. And so we say that this is a polar molecule. So acetone is a relatively polar molecule. The same thing happens to this acetone molecule down here. So we get a partial negative, and we get a partial positive. So this is a polar molecule as well. It has two poles. So we call this a dipole. So each molecule has a dipole moment. And because each molecule is polar and has a separation of positive and negative charge, in organic chemistry we know that opposite charges attract, right? So this negatively charged oxygen is going to be attracted to this positively charged carbon. And so there's going to be an electrostatic attraction between those two molecules. And that's what's going to hold these two molecules together. And you would therefore need energy if you were to try to pull them apart. And so the boiling point of acetone turns out to be approximately 56 degrees Celsius. And since room temperature is between 20 and 25, at room temperature we have not reached the boiling point of acetone. And therefore, acetone is still a liquid. So at room temperature and pressure, acetone is a liquid. And it has to do with the intermolecular force of dipole-dipole interactions holding those molecules together. And the intermolecular force, in turn, depends on the electronegativity. Let's look at another intermolecular force, and this one's called hydrogen bonding. So here we have two water molecules. And once again, if I think about these electrons here, which are between the oxygen and the hydrogen, I know oxygen's more electronegative than hydrogen. So oxygen's going to pull those electrons closer to it, giving the oxygen a partial negative charge like that. The hydrogen is losing a little bit of electron density, therefore becoming partially positive. The same situation exists in the water molecule down here. So we have a partial negative, and we have a partial positive. And so like the last example, we can see there's going to be some sort of electrostatic attraction between those opposite charges, between the negatively partially charged oxygen, and the partially positive hydrogen like that. And so this is a polar molecule. Of course, water is a polar molecule. And so you would think that this would be an example of dipole-dipole interaction. And it is, except in this case it's an even stronger version of dipole-dipole interaction that we call hydrogen bonding. So at one time it was thought that it was possible for hydrogen to form an extra bond. And that's where the term originally comes from. But of course, it's not an actual intramolecular force. We're talking about an intermolecular force. But it is the strongest intermolecular force. The way to recognize when hydrogen bonding is present as opposed to just dipole-dipole is to see what the hydrogen is bonded to. And so in this case, we have a very electronegative atom, hydrogen, bonded-- oxygen, I should say-- bonded to hydrogen. And then that hydrogen is interacting with another electronegative atom like that. So we have a partial negative, and we have a partial positive, and then we have another partial negative over here. And this is the situation that you need to have when you have hydrogen bonding. Here's your hydrogen showing intermolecular force here. And what some students forget is that this hydrogen actually has to be bonded to another electronegative atom in order for there to be a big enough difference in electronegativity for there to be a little bit extra attraction. And so the three electronegative elements that you should remember for hydrogen bonding are fluorine, oxygen, and nitrogen. And so the mnemonics that students use is FON. So if you remember FON as the electronegative atoms that can participate in hydrogen bonding, you should be able to remember this intermolecular force. The boiling point of water is, of course, about 100 degrees Celsius, so higher than what we saw for acetone. And this just is due to the fact that hydrogen bonding is a stronger version of dipole-dipole interaction, and therefore, it takes more energy or more heat to pull these water molecules apart in order to turn them into a gas. And so, of course, water is a liquid at room temperature. All right. Let's look at another intermolecular force. And this one is called London dispersion forces. So these are the weakest intermolecular forces, and they have to do with the electrons that are always moving around in orbitals. And even though the methane molecule here, if we look at it, we have a carbon surrounded by four hydrogens for methane. And it's hard to tell in how I've drawn the structure here, but if you go back and you look at the video for the tetrahedral bond angle proof, you can see that in three dimensions, these hydrogens are coming off of the carbon, and they're equivalent in all directions. And there's a very small difference in electronegativity between the carbon and the hydrogen. And that small difference is canceled out in three dimensions. So the methane molecule becomes nonpolar as a result of that. So this one's nonpolar, and, of course, this one's nonpolar. And so there's no dipole-dipole interaction. There's no hydrogen bonding. The only intermolecular force that's holding two methane molecules together would be London dispersion forces. And so once again, you could think about the electrons that are in these bonds moving in those orbitals. And let's say for the molecule on the left, if for a brief transient moment in time you get a little bit of negative charge on this side of the molecule, so it might turn out to be those electrons have a net negative charge on this side. And then for this molecule, the electrons could be moving the opposite direction, giving this a partial positive. And so there could be a very, very small bit of attraction between these two methane molecules. It's very weak, which is why London dispersion forces are the weakest intermolecular forces. But it is there. And that's the only thing that's holding together these methane molecules. And since it's weak, we would expect the boiling point for methane to be extremely low. And, of course, it is. So the boiling point for methane is somewhere around negative 164 degrees Celsius. And so since room temperature is somewhere around 20 to 25, obviously methane has already boiled, if you will, and turned into a gas. So methane is obviously a gas at room temperature and pressure. Now, if you increase the number of carbons, you're going to increase the number of attractive forces that are possible. And if you do that, you can actually increase the boiling point of other hydrocarbons dramatically. And so even though London dispersion forces are the weakest, if you have larger molecules and you sum up all those extra forces, it can actually turn out to be rather significant when you're working with larger molecules. And so this is just a quick summary of some of the intermolecular forces to show you the application of electronegativity and how important it is.",science_organic-chemistry_gen-chem-review
" -  What we're going to do in this video is practice squaring binomials, and this is something that we've done in the past, but we're gonna do it with slightly more involved expressions. But let's just start with a little bit of review. If I were to ask you, what is a plus b squared, what would that be? Pause the video and try to figure it out. Well some of you might immediately know what a binomial like this squared is, but I'll work it out. So this is the same thing as a plus b times a plus b. And then we could multiply this a times that a. So that's going to give us a squared. And then I can multiply that a times that b, and that's going to give us ab. Then I could multiply this b times that a. I could write that as ba or ab, so I'll just write it as ab again. And then I multiply this b times that b, so plus b squared. And what I really just did is apply the distributive property twice. We go into a lot of detail in previous videos. Some people also like to call it the FOIL method. Either way, this should all be a review. If it's not, I encourage you to look at those introductory videos. But this is going to simplify to a squared plus we have an ab and another ab, so you add those together, you get two ab plus b squared. Now why did I go through this review? Well now we can use this idea that a plus b squared is equal to a squared plus two ab plus b squared to tackle things that at least look a little bit more involved. So if I were to ask you, what is five x to the sixth plus four squared, pause this video and try to figure it out. And try to keep this and this in mind. Well there is several ways you could approach this. You could just expand this out the way we just did, or you could recognize this pattern that we just established. That if I have an a plus b and I square it, it's going to be this. And so what you might notice is, the role of a is being played by five x to the sixth right over there, and the role of b is being played by four right over there. So we could say, hey, this is going to be equal to a squared, we have our a squared there. So what is a squared? Well five x to the sixth squared is going to be 25 x to the 12th power. And then it's going to be plus two times a times b. So plus two times five x to the sixth times four. Actually let me just write it out just so we don't confuse ourselves. Two times five x to the, I'll color code it too, two times five x to the sixth times four, times four, plus b squared. So plus four squared, so that's going to be plus 16. And then we can simplify this. So this is going to be equal to 25 x to the 12th. Two times five times four is 40. Two times five is 10 times four is 40. So plus 40 x to the sixth plus 16. Let's do another example. And I'll do this one even a little bit faster, just because we're getting, I think, pretty good at this. So let's say we're trying to determine what three t squared minus seven t to the sixth power squared is. Pause the video and try to figure it out. All right we're going to do it together now. So this is our a, and our b now we should view as negative seven t to the sixth. Because this says plus b, so you could view this as plus negative seven t to the sixth. We could even write that if we wanted. We could write this plus negative seven t to the sixth if it helps us recognize this whole thing as b. So this is going to be equal to a squared, which is nine t to the fourth, plus two times this times this, two times a times b. So two times three t squared is going to be six t squared times negative seven t to the sixth. Actually let me write this out. This is getting a little bit complicated. So this is going to be plus two times three t squared times negative seven t to the sixth power. And then last but not least, we're going to square negative seven t to the sixth. So that's going to be negative seven squared is positive 49, and t to the sixth squared is t to the 12th, t to the 12th power. And so this is going to be equal to nine t to the fourth, and let's see, two times three is six times negative seven is negative 42, and t squared times t to the sixth, we add the exponents, we have the same base, so it's going to be t to the eighth. And then we have plus 49 t to the 12th power. So it looks like we did something really fancy. We have this higher degree polynomial. We were squaring this binomial that has these higher degree terms. But we're really just applying the same idea that we learned many many many videos ago, many many lessons ago, in terms of just squaring binomials.",math_math3_poly-arithmetic
" So our goal in this video is to take the antiderivative of this fairly crazy looking expression. Or another way of saying it is to find the indefinite integral of this crazy looking expression. And the key realization right over here is that this expression is made up of a bunch of terms. And the indefinite integral of the entire expression is going to be equal to the indefinite integral of each of the term. So this is going to be equal to, we could look at this term right over here, and just take the indefinite that, 7x to the third dx. And then from that, we can subtract the indefinite integral of this thing. So we could say this is, and then minus the indefinite integral of 5 times the square root of x dx. And then we can look at this one right over here. So then we could say plus the indefinite integral of 18 square root of x. Square roots of x, over x to the third dx. And then finally, I'm running out of colors here, finally I need more colors in my thing. We can take the antiderivative of this. So plus the antiderivative of x to the negative 40th power dx. So I've just rewritten this and color-coded things. So let's take the antiderivative of each of these. And you'll see that we'll be able to do it using our whatever we want to call it. The inverse of the power rule, or the anti-power rule, whatever you might want to call it. So let's look at the first one. So we have-- what I'm going to do is, I'm just going to find the antiderivative without the constant, and just add the constant at the end. For the sake of this one. Just to make sure we get the most general antiderivative. So here the exponent is a 3. So we can increase it by 1. So it's going to be x to the 4th. Let me do that same purple color, or pink color. It's going to be x to the 4th, or we're going to divide by x to the 4th. So it's x to the 4th over 4 is the antiderivative of x to the 3rd. And you just had this scaling quantity, the seven out front. So we can still just have the seven out front. So we get 7x to the 4th over 4. Fair enough. From that, we're going to subtract the antiderivative of this. Now at first this might not be obvious, that you could use our inverse power rule, or anti-power rule here. But then you just need to realize that 5 times the principal root of x is the same thing as 5 times x to the 1/2 power. And so once again, the exponent here is 1/2. We can increment it by 1. So it's going to be x to the 3/2. And then divide by the incremented exponent. So divide by 3/2. And of course we had this 5 out front, so we still want to have the 5 out front. Now this next expression looks even wackier. But once again, we can simplify a little bit. This is the same thing-- let me do it right over here-- this is the same thing as 18 times x to the 1/2 times x to the negative 3 power. x to the 3rd in the denominator is the same thing as x to the negative 3. We have the same base, we could just add the exponents. So this is going to be equal to 18 times x to the 2 and 1/2 power. Or another way of thinking about it, this is the same thing as 18 times x to the 5/2 power. Did I do that right? Yeah. Negative 3. Oh sorry, this is negative 2 and 1/2. Let me make this very clear. And this is going to be the negative 5/2 power. x to the negative 3 is the same thing as x to the negative 6/2. Negative 6/2 plus 1/2 is negative 5/2. So once again, we just have to increment this exponent. So negative 5/2 plus 1 is going to be negative 3/2. So you're going to have x to the negative 3/2. And then you divide by what your exponent is when you increment it. So divide it by negative 3/2. And then you had the 18 out front. And we obviously are going to have to simplify this. And then finally, our exponent in this term. Let me not use that purple anymore. The exponent in this term right over here is negative 40. If we increment it, we get x to the negative 39 power, all of that over negative 39. And now we can add our constant, c. And all we need to do is simplify all of this craziness. So the first one is fairly simplified. We can write it as 7/4 x to the 4th. Now this term right over here is essentially negative 5 divided by 3/2. So 5 over 3/2 is equal to 5 times 2/3, which is equal to 10 over 3. So this thing right over here simplifies to negative 10/3 x to the 3/2. And then we have all of this craziness. Now 18 divided by negative 3/2 is equal to 18 times negative 2/3. Which is equal to, well we can simplify this a little bit, this is the same thing as 6 times negative 2. Which is equal to negative 12. So this expression right over here is negative 12x to the negative 3/2. And then finally, this one right over here, we can just rewrite it as, if we want, we could, well, we could just write negative 1/39 x to the negative 39 plus c. And we're done. We've found the indefinite integral of all this craziness. And I encourage you to take the derivative of this. And you can do it using really just the power rule, to take the derivative of this. And verify that it does indeed equal this expression that we took the antiderivative of.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-integrals
" Let's say I've got some type of a book over here. So there is my book. I'll write it down, book. Let me draw the entire book. So this is my entire book, just like that. And then I have a mirror over here. So this is a mirror. We're just looking at the mirror from the side-- I can do a better job of a straight line than that-- so that is a mirror. Now, what I want to do is pick, and I'm really picking an arbitrary point on this book. And we know that there's light that is coming on this book-- maybe I haven't told us about the light source-- but we're assuming that the book will reflect the light diffusely, like most books do. It is not a shiny book. And so any point on this book, and we could pick any arbitrary point on this book, is going to be emitting light in a whole bunch of directions. So what I'm just going to do is pick two light rays that are being emitted from this point on the book. It'll be more than two, but this will help us understand what's going on here. So let me pick one light ray that goes like this-- it's obviously not curving like that-- so it goes like this, and hits the mirror. Incident angle is equal to reflected angle, so it'll reflect off at the same angle just like that. And let me pick another point that is coming out radially from that same, or another ray that is coming out radially from that same point, so it'll come out like that. It has a larger incident angle, so it'll have a larger reflected angle, just like that. And now let's think about what an observer, someone who has their eyeball right over here-- so let's say someone has their eyeball right over here. Let me draw their eyebrows so that you get the general idea-- let's think about what this person right over here will actually see. And remember all of reality is really just a big simulation going on in our brains. Now, this person's eye is going to see these two light rays diverging from some common point. If you were to look straight at the book-- let me just do another example-- if someone were to just look at any arbitrary object, let's say that's an orange right over there. And just ignore all the stuff on the left. If I were to look at an orange, no mirror, nothing, no reflections, or anything, if I were to look at a certain point on the orange, light from that point would be diverging out radially. And if my eye were right over there, my brain says, OK, I have these light rays diverging from a single point. It will simulate, or it will show me that point of an orange in my brain. Now, The same thing is going to happen here, even though these two rays actually aren't diverging from a point out here. Your brain will say, OK, I got two things that are coming out from what looks like a point over here. It'll really just extrapolate these lines backwards. So it'll take that green ray and it'll say, OK, it must be coming from a point out there. And it'll take that magenta ray and it'll say, it must be coming from a point out there. Your eye is just seeing these two light rays, it doesn't know what's going on over here. It just says OK, they're just converging from a point. And so in this person's reality, or in my reality, I think that there is an orange there. Likewise, I see these two light rays diverging from some common point. I will extrapolate to figure out-- or my brain will try to think about-- where that point is in three dimensional space. It says, look, these two rays look like they're coming from a point back over here. Now, the reality is, there is no back over here. There is nothing behind the mirror, but to this observer, it looks like the light is being emitted behind the observer. And so what the person would actually see is something like this. And this is probably not too foreign to any of our experiences. We've all looked in mirrors-- and remember, this is the left side of this book-- oh, sorry. This is the right side of the book. It's the side that has the curvy part of the B so it'll look like this. So what this observer sees is an image that looks like this. It is what people call the mirror image. It is flipped. The left and the right is flipped and you can think about why that is. I could just draw another ray right here to make it clear. If this ray is coming like this. Now, it will reflect and come out back like this to this observer it came from that point right over there. So he sees a flipped version of the book. Now the whole reason why I did this is one, just to make you feel a little comfortable with these reflecting lines and all of that. But one, I guess more importantly to get you more comfortable with the idea of a virtual image. This right here is a virtual image and we're going to compare it with a real image in the next video. And to some degree, a virtual image is more intuitive because we have so much experience with it when we think about mirrors or reflective surfaces. So it's a virtual image. And we call it a virtual image because the book really isn't there. It's virtually there. There is no actual physical space, or we don't know if there's any physical space behind the image. Our brain just uses these diverging lights and creates a model inside of our brain to say, OK, that book exists there, even though the source of the light is over here. Now I'm just going to draw another diagram, and you normally won't have the diagrams that have this type of perspective, but just to give you a sense of the same thing. And just to get you familiar with some of these diagrams that we're going to do when we study mirrors and lenses, is we could imagine that this is the ground, let's say that this is a mirror. And let's say that this is actually could be somebody standing in front of a mirror. Although usually people will draw an arrow here to just say an arbitrary object, Well, let's just say we have an arrow in front of the mirror, just so you get used to this notation. This is actually a physical arrow, this is not a light ray. Now let's think about what the image of this arrow-- let's say this arrow had eyes, so it's actually a person. So this arrow had eyes, what would this arrow see? Well, let's just pick an arbitrary point of this arrow. You could do it with any point-- this object-- because every point will be reflecting light diffusely. So I'm going to take one point that's coming straight out of the mirror-- one light ray that goes straight to the mirror-- so just parallel to the ground, straight to the mirror. Well, it's just going to reflect straight off and then come back to the source of that light. Maybe that arrow's eye, if you view it as a person. And let's just do another point, another ray coming from that point. So another ray coming from that point might come out like that. Incident angle is equal to reflected angle, so then it would come back like that. Now, maybe this whole thing is an eye. Maybe that'll simplify things. So let's say this whole thing is you're looking really close at a mirror. This whole thing is an eye. Now what would the eye see? Well, it's looking-- this ray looks like it's coming from back over here. And then this ray looks like it's coming from back over here. This is where they converge, so the eye would see this point of the eye over there. So it will actually see itself. And in general, these type of diagrams are used to think about what would the real or virtual image be of an object once the light from that object either is reflected off of a mirror, or goes through some type of lens. And we'll be doing this a lot more in future videos. But anyway, hopefully that gets you a little bit familiar with the things we'll be dealing with.",science_physics_geometric-optics
" -  Let's say that you have a jar of jelly beans, and you know that there are exactly 282 jelly beans in that jar of jelly beans. And then the next day you come and you see there are fewer and you say, what happened, and let's say someone who lives with you or your friend says, oh yeah, I counted exactly and I ate 59 of those jelly beans. So you started with 282, 59 are taken out, and you don't need to know exactly how many jelly beans are left, but you wanna estimate roughly how many jelly beans are left, and that's why, as this title of the video says, we're going to estimate when subtracting large numbers. And we can debate how large is large, but these are reasonably large. So let's do that, let's see if we can estimate what 282 minus 59 is. And sometimes when we're estimating, we will use this squiggly equal sign. This means approximately, which is another, just a fancy way of saying roughly what is this equal to. So the way that I would approach this, I would say hey, are these close to numbers that are easier to subtract with. So for example, 282, I'd say, you know what, maybe I can round to the nearest 10 here, and so I could round it down to 280, if I round down to the nearest 10. If I rounded up, it would be 290, but 282 is closer to 280 than it is to 290. So I would round this, when I'm estimating to 280. And then what about 59? If I were to round to the nearest 10, what would I round that to? Pause the video and think about that. Well, 59 if I round down to the nearest 10, it would be 50, and if I round up to the nearest 10, it would be 60, and 59 is definitely closer to 60. So I would say that this is roughly, if I'm rounding, I could say, hey I'm gonna round that to 60. So I could say the 282 minus 59 is roughly going to be 280 minus 60. And now what is this? You might be able to do this in your head. You could view this as 28 tens minus six tens, and so if you have 28 of something minus six of it, you're going to be left with 22 of that something. And so you could say that this is going to be 22 tens. 22 tens, or another way to think about it. You have two 100s and then 8 tens, and then you're gonna take six tens away from it, so then you'll be left with two 100s and two tens. Just like we have here. So the whole point here, this is not, this is actually not exactly what 282 minus 59 is, but if you just said, hey ballpark do I, I wanna know, do I have roughly how many jelly beans do I have, well this could be useful. And you'll see later in life this is actually a very, very usefully skill where you might have these numbers that get a lot larger than this, but you'll round to the nearest 10, or you'll round to other places, so that you can do that computation in your head.",math_cc-third-grade-math_imp-addition-and-subtraction
" -  Let's say there's some type of standardized exam where every question on the test has four choices, choice A, choice B, choice C, and choice D. And the test makers assure folks that, over many years, there's an equal probability that the correct answer for any one of the items is A, B, C, or D. It essentially is a 25% chance of any of them. Now, let's say you have a hunch that, well, maybe it is skewed towards one letter or another. How could you test this? Well, you could start with a null and alternative hypothesis, and then we can actually do a hypothesis test. So let's say that our null hypothesis is equal distribution, equal distribution of correct choices, correct choices. Or another way of thinking about it is A would be correct 25% of the time, B would be correct 25% of the time, C would be correct 25% of the time, and D would be correct 25% of the time. Now, what would be our alternative hypothesis? Well, alternative hypothesis would be not equal distribution, not equal distribution. Now, how are we going to actually test this? Well, we've seen this show before, at least the beginnings of the show. You have the population of all of your potential items here, and you could take a sample. And so let's say we take a sample of 100 items. So n is equal to 100. And let's write down the data that we get when we look at that sample. So this is the correct choice, correct choice. And then this would be the expected number that you would expect. And then this is the actual number. And if this doesn't make sense yet, we'll see it in a second. So there's four different choices, A, B, C, D and a sample of 100. Remember, in any hypothesis test, we start assuming that the null hypothesis is true. So the expected number where A is a correct choice would be 25% of this 100. So you would expect 25 times the A to be the correct choice, 25 times B to be the correct choice, 25 times C to be the correct choice, and 25 times D to be the correct choice. But let's say our actual results, when we look at these 100 items, we get that A is the correct choice 20 times, B is the correct choice 20 times, C is the correct choice 25 times, and D is the correct choice 35 times. So if you just look at this, just look, hey, maybe there's a higher frequency of D, but maybe you'd say, well, this is just a sample. And just through random chance, it might have just gotten more Ds than not. There's some probability of getting this result, even assuming that the null hypothesis is true. And that's the goal of these hypothesis tests, is say what's the probability of getting a result at least this extreme? And if that probability is below some threshold, then we tend to reject the null hypothesis and accept an alternative. And those thresholds you have seen before. We've seen these significance levels. Let's say we set a significance level of 5%, 0.05. So if the probability of getting this result or something even more different than what's expected is less than the significance level, then we'd reject the null hypothesis. But this all leads to one really interesting question. How do we calculate a probability of getting a result this extreme or more extreme? How do we even measure that? And this is where we're going to introduce a new statistic and also, for many of you, a new Greek letter, and that is the capital Greek letter chi, which might look like an X to you. But it's a little bit curvier, and you could look up more on that. You kind of curve that part of the X. But it's a chi, not an X. And the statistic is called chi-squared, and it's a way of taking the difference between the actual and the expected and translating that into a number. And the chi-squared distribution is, well, I really should say distributions are well studied. And we can use that to figure out what is the probability of getting a result this extreme or more extreme? And if that's lower than our significance level, we reject the null hypothesis, and it suggests the alternative. But how do we calculate the chi-squared statistic here? Well, it's reasonably intuitive. What we do is, for each of these categories, in this case, it's for each of these choices, we look at the difference between the actual and the expected. So for choice A, we'd say 20 is the actual minus the expected. And then we're going to square that. And then we're going to divide by what was expected. And then we're going to do that for choice B. So we're going to say the actual was 20, expected is 25, so 20 minus 25 squared, over the expected, over 25. Plus then we do that for choice C. 25 minus 25, we know where that one will end up, squared, over the expected, over 25. And then finally, for choice D, which is going to get us 35 minus 25 squared, all of that over 25. And we are now, let's see, if we calculate this, this is going to be negative five squared. So that's going to be 25. This is going to be 25. This is going to be zero. 35 minus 25 is 10, squared, that is 100. So this is one plus one, plus zero, plus four. So our chi-squared statistic, in this example, came out nice and clean, this won't always be the case, at six. So what do we make of this? Well, what we can do is then look at a chi-squared distribution for the appropriate degrees of freedom, and we'll talk about that in a second, and say what is the probability of getting a chi-squared statistic six or larger? And to understand what a chi-squared distribution even looks like, these are multiple chi-squared distributions for different values for the degrees of freedom. And to calculate the degrees of freedom, you look at the number of categories. In this case, we have four categories, and you subtract one. Now, that makes a lot of sense because, if you knew how many As, Bs, and Cs there are, if you knew the proportions, even the assumed proportions, you can always calculate the fourth one. That's why it is four minus one degrees of freedom. So in this case, our degrees of freedom are going to be equal to three. Over here, sometimes you'll see it described as k, so k is equal to three. So if we look at, that's that little light blue, so we're looking at this chi-squared distribution where the degree of freedom is three. And we want to figure out what is the probability of getting a chi-squared statistic that is six or greater? So we would be looking at this area right over here. And you could figure it out using a calculator, or, if you're taking some type of a test, like an AP Statistics exam, for example, you could use their tables they give you. And so a table like this could be quite useful. Remember, we're dealing with the situation where we have three degrees of freedom. We had four categories, so four minus one is three. And we got a chi-squared value. Our chi-squared statistic was six. So this right over here tells us the probability of getting a 6.25 or greater for our chi-squared value is 10%. If we go back to this chart, we just learned that this probability from 6.25 and up, when we have three degrees of freedom, that this right over here is 10%. Well, that's 10%. Then the probability, the probability of getting a chi-squared value greater than or equal to six is going to be greater than 10%, greater than 10%. And we could also view this as our P-value. And so for our probability, assuming the null hypothesis is greater than 10%, well, it's definitely going to be greater than our significance level. And because of that, we will fail to reject, fail to reject. And so this is an example of, even though in your sample, you just happened to get more Ds, the probability of getting a result at least as extreme as what you saw is going to be a little bit over 10%.",math_statistics-probability_inference-categorical-data-chi-square-tests
" SAL KHAN: I'm here with the Dr. Laura Bachrach at Stanford Medical School. And what are we going to talk about? DR. LAURA BACHRACH: We're going to talk about normal and abnormal growth in children. SAL KHAN: Fascinating. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So this is an important concern. Parents really worry if their child is growing normally. And physicians worry about this too, because the change in height is an important barometer of how the child is doing overall, in terms of health. So to begin to assess the child's growth pattern, we have to think about what are the determits of where the child should be on the growth curve. The number one most important determit, of course, is genetics. Short parents are more likely to have short children and vice versa. SAL KHAN: And that's true even when a child is young, because sometimes I've seen the opposite. So people who are petite have large children and all the rest. But it is true that, if someone is large, they're more likely to have large children, even infants and toddlers. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: You've hit upon a really important issue that's shown here in this slide. The size of a baby at birth isn't necessarily going to reflect the genetics. There are babies that are born small, because mother didn't have prenatal care. Mother was a smoker, other factors that compromise the growth of the child. And those babies can be born small for their gestational age. During the first two to three years of life, they have a chance to catch up on the curve and reach what's called their genetic potential. SAL KHAN: So let's just make sure. I want to make sure. I've seen these curves before, when I went to visit a pediatrician, even I remember this when I used to visit the pediatrician, which I did maybe a little too long. So this axis right over here is age. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: In months. SAL KHAN: In months-- so this is right here birth. This is birth. So if a baby is born at-- I don't know. This is the weight right over here. So if a baby is born at five pounds-- is this in pounds? This is kilograms. OK, so five pounds is right over. Is that right? Yeah, five pounds would be right over here. So this would be a baby born at five pounds. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right. And I'm talking more here, during this growth lecture, about the height or length of the baby, throughout babyhood and childhood. But let's say, the baby were born light in weight and short in length. SAL KHAN: So maybe 18 inches right here would be a short length. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right, and let's say, that baby was small because his mother had issues during the pregcy. SAL KHAN: Is it always the case that the baby will be small because of issues? DR. LAURA BACHRACH: No. The bottom line is that genetics plays less of a part in the size of the baby at birth than it will later on in childhood. SAL KHAN: All right, it makes sense. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So to come back to your point, you'll meet parents whose baby seem to be larger or smaller than they are. But by age three the child should be-- SAL KHAN: Hold on one second. Let me just close this. OK. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: By age three, the child should be in his or her genetic groove, if you will. SAL KHAN: I see. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So there can be movement on the growth curve in the first two to three years of life. There can be catch-up growth, where the child, who was small, let's say, moves from below the curve up to the 50th percentile, by age 24 months. SAL KHAN: So this would be a child who does something like this. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Exactly, exactly. And you can have the converse, where you have a very big baby. Let's say, mother had uncontrolled diabetes, and the baby was born very large. That baby can have catch-down growth, to the 50th percentile. By the age of three, certainly movement across percentiles is considered to be abnormal and warrants an investigation. SAL KHAN: So you really can predict someone's even adult height, based on where they at three? DR. LAURA BACHRACH: A general rule of thumb is, that by age 2 and 1/2 to 3, the child is in their genetic groove. SAL KHAN: Really? Oh, wow. I didn't realize that quickly you can kind of-- so if a child, at age three or four, is in the 25th percentile in height, it's unlikely that they're going to be in the NBA? DR. LAURA BACHRACH: In general, that's true. There are a few exceptions. There are late bloomers, what we call a constitutional delay of growth. But a general rule would be, what percentile you are by the age of two or three is pretty much where you're going to track, if all things are going normally. SAL KHAN: Wow, I never realized that it was that soon. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And genetics is an important determit as I said. We can actually do a calculation of where we think a child should end up, the so-called mid-parental height, which we are going to talk about later. So genetics is the critical factor. But whether or not you reach your genetic potential means that the cards have to be lined up appropriately. So the cards that are important for achieving your genetic potentials, first of all, number one-- normal amounts of hormones that are important for growing. And those are thyroid and growth hormone, to a large extent. A second factor, of course, is adequate nutrition. And we think worldwide of children who are undernourished, who don't look anywhere near their age, in terms of height, because they're so undernourished. It really cramps their style. SAL KHAN: And you see the reverse of that. I mean, I don't know what I am officially. I was born here. My parents weren't. So I'm what, first generation or second generation. But you see that in that, is that you see a lot of people in my generation are much taller than their parents, because their parents were probably malnourished in some way. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Certainly, there can be a secular trend, where the children get taller than the parents, if the children have a different environment. The other thing we notice about nutrition in our country is the over-nutrition of our children. And what happens with obesity is that children may grow faster, in terms of both weight and height for their age. They don't end up taller in the long run. But they move ahead more quickly through the maturation process. SAL KHAN: I see. I didn't know. OK, it can accelerate. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Exactly. SAL KHAN: I never realized that. That's fascinating. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And then we think about psychosocial factors. There literally is a situation where infants can be deprived of parental love and support, and you see something dwarfing there. In a teenager, we see problems with eating disorders, that's a cross between nutrition and a psychological problem. So psychosocial factors play a role as well. SAL KHAN: So they've shown, or it's been seen that it's noticeable changes in physical development, based on, I guess, attention and love. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Yes, there's actually a syndrome called psychosocial dwarfism, where you can actually see a slow down in growing without adequate interpersonal support. SAL KHAN: Wow, that's fascinating. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So the issue is, when do you need to worry about a child's growth pattern? In order to interpret that, you have to understand about the variability in growth. In the first two to three years of life, children grow much more quickly than they will later on. By the age of three, until they hit puberty, children should grow two inches a year. SAL KHAN: Two inches a year, this is from the ages of-- DR. LAURA BACHRACH: After they're out of toddlerhood until they hit puberty. SAL KHAN: So this is like three to puberty. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Exactly, exactly. But when kids will hit puberty is going to be variable. And so that's an issue. If children are growing at a normal rate, it's not necessary to memorize the inches per year. Children will track along the growth curve. And if we can turn to the next slide or next graph, this is a graph for what we use for older children, after the age of 2 up until they're 18. This is the curve that we use. Now, beyond the age of two, I said to you, it's not normal for children to necessarily cross percentiles. So if, for example, you have a child who is tracking along the fifth percentile every year, growing their two inches a year. SAL KHAN: This is the fifth down here? DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right, the lower line there. They're moving along, steadily, steadily, steadily. That child has a more reassuring growth curve than one, for example, who as a five-year-old had been at the top of the curve. SAL KHAN: Right, a five-year-old. So five-year-old is right there. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And then the next year is on the 75th moving down a line. SAL KHAN: I see. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And the year after is on the 50th percentile. Now, at that point in time, the child has theoretically a normal height because it's within the curve. But there's something very abnormal about that rate of growing. And that's the child that's more worrisome than the shorter child. SAL KHAN: Fascinating. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So bottom line, when a child would come in to present to me because of a concern about growing, I'd first of all try to decide if they're are short and if they're growing normally. And those are two different questions. The first question is, are they short? And are they short can be defined by looking at these curves. These are curves representing the spectrum of normal height for a healthy American youth. And they go from the 5th to the 95th percentile. So you can compare a child to the population as a whole. But I also like to calculate what we call the mid-parental height. OK, this is where we take into account the heights of the parents, because that's the most important determit. So how we calculate that is as follows. We take the height of mom and dad and average them. SAL KHAN: OK, let's do that. So I'm 5' 9"", if I'm wearing decent shoes. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK. SAL KHAN: So set that to 69 inches. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK. And how tall is the mother of your children? SAL KHAN: She's 5' 6"". DR. LAURA BACHRACH: She's 5' 6"". SAL KHAN: Which is why I don't let her wear too large heels. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK. And are we trying to calculate your son or your daughter? SAL KHAN: Let's do my son, since he's a little older. So let's see, it's plus 66 inches. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK. So we'll take the midpoint of that. SAL KHAN: OK, so that's really an inch and 1/2. So it's what, 67 and 1/2 inches between me and my wife. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right. 1And we're going to add 2 and 1/2 inches. 1SAL KHAN: OK. 1So that gets us what, to exactly 70 inches. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right. 1And that's the height prediction for your son. 1SAL KHAN: Oh, very good. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Plus or minus-- 1SAL KHAN: Oh, plus or minus. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: 4 inches. 1SAL KHAN: Plus or minus 4 inches, 1oh, that's a big difference. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: It's a big difference. 1But that's the nature of human variability. 1SAL KHAN: I see. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK. 1Now, if this were your daughter, we 1would take the 67 and 1/2 inches and subtract 2 and 1/2 inches. 1Let's do that. 1SAL KHAN: OK, so that gets us 65, so 5' 5"" 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Exactly, plus or minus 4 inches. 1SAL KHAN: Plus or minus 4 inches. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So that's something we do. 1We then calculate-- in fact, let's plot that, 1right on the curve. 1This is the boys' curve, so let's plot the 70 inches. 1SAL KHAN: 70 inches is right over here, OK. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And then the range of 74. 1SAL KHAN: 74 to 66. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right, exactly-- pretty broad range. 1SAL KHAN: Yes. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK. 1But if we had a child who was growing well below the curve 1and we thought the midpoint should 1be about the 50th percentile, that child 1would be short for the family. 1So we always like to take the family heights into account. 1So number one question, is the child's short? 1It will depend on what the height prediction is. 1SAL KHAN: I see. 1So if my son was tracking down here at the 5%. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: That would be concerning. 1SAL KHAN: Even if he's growing the two inches every year 1and he's tracking that, it still would be concerning. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Well, it would raise some questions 1in our minds. 1But that's the more important factor is not just 1where they on the curve at the moment. 1But are they growing at the normal rate? 1And the child who is not growing at the normal rate 1raises more red flags than the child 1who's trotting up the curve. 1SAL KHAN: Fascinating. 1That's interesting, wow. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So that's the issue. 1And that's what we approach every day. 1We want to look into the various causes, 1potentially, for growth slowdown. 1We want to address treatment to the specific etiology. 1SAL KHAN: And etiology means-- 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Well, for example, 1if the child has a deficiency of thyroid hormone, 1we want to give thyroid hormone back. 1SAL KHAN: So etiology is like the cause. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: The cause. 1If the child isn't growing because he has a nutritional 1problem, like Celiac Disease, we want 1to put him on a special diet to address that issue. 1Some parents think, well, what we 1want to do-- my child is healthy and normal and growing 1normally, but I want to give him some growth hormone. 1That becomes a topic in itself. 1SAL KHAN: Right, very good. 1Well, thank you for this. 1This was super informative.",science_health-and-medicine_healthcare-misc
" - So I have a function here, h of n, and let's say that it explicitly defines the terms of a sequence. Let me make a little... Let me make a quick table here. We have n, and then we have h of n. When n is equal to one, h of n is negative 31, minus seven times one minus one, which is going to be... This is just going to be zero, so it's going to be negative 31. When n is equal to two, it's going to be negative 31 minus seven times two minus one, so two minus one. This is just going to be one, so it's negative 31 minus seven, which is equal to negative 38. When n is equal to three, it's gonna be negative 31 minus seven times three minus one, which is just two, so we're gonna subtract seven twice. It's gonna be negative 31 minus 14, which is equal negative 45. What do we see happening here? We're starting at negative 31, and then we keep subtracting, we keep subtracting negative seven. We keep subtracting negative seven from that. In fact we subtract negative seven one less than the term... We subtract negative seven one less times than the term we're dealing with. If we're dealing with the third term we subtract negative seven twice. If we're dealing with the second term we subtract negative seven once. This is all nice, but what I want you to do now is pause the video and see if you can define this exact same sequence. The sequence here is you start at negative 31, and you keep subtracting negative seven, so negative 38, negative 45. The next one is gonna be negative 52, and you go on and on and on. You keep subtracting negative seven. Can we define this sequence in terms of a recursive function? Why don't you have a go at that. Let's try to define it in terms of a recursive function. Let's just call that g of n, so g of n. In some ways a recursive function is easier, because you can say okay look. The first term when n is equal to one, if n is equal to one, let me just write it, If n is equal to one, if n is equal to one, what's g of n gonna be? It's gonna be negative 31, negative 31. And if n, if n is greater than one and a whole number, so this is gonna be defined for all positive integers, and whole, and whole number, it's just going to be the previous term, so g of n minus one minus seven, minus seven. We're saying hey if we're just picking an arbitrary term we just have to look at the previous term and then subtract, and then subtract seven. It all works out nice and easy, because you keep looking at previous, previous, previous terms all the way until you get to the base case, which is when n is equal to one, and you can build up back from that. You get this exact same sequence. Let's do another example, but let's go the other way around. Here we have a, we have a sequence defined recursively, and I want to create a function that defines a sequence explicitly. Let's think about this. One way to think about it, this sequence, when n is equal to one it starts at 9.6, and then every term is the previous term minus 0.1. The second term is gonna be the previous term minus 0.1, so it's gonna be 9.5. Then you're gonna go to 9.4. Then you're gonna go to 9.3. We could keep going on and on and on. If we want, we could make a little table here, and we could say this is n, this is h of n, and you see when n is equal to one, h of n is 9.6. When n is equal to two, we're now in this case over here, it's gonna h of two minus one, so it's gonna be h of one minus 0.1. It's just gonna be this minus 0.1, which is going to be 9.5. When h is three, it's gonna be h of two, h of two minus 0.1, minus 0.1. H of two is right over here. You subtract a tenth you're gonna get 9.4, exactly what we saw over here. Let's see if we can pause the video now and define this... Create a function that constructs or defines this arithmetic sequence explicitly. Here it was recursively. We wanna define it explicitly. So let's just call it, I don't know, let's just call it f of n. We can say look, it's gonna be 9.6, but we're gonna subtract, we're gonna subtract 0.1 a certain number of times depending on what term we're talking about. We're gonna subtract 0.1, but how many times are we gonna subtract it as a function of n? Let's see. If we're talking about the first term we subtract zero times. The second term we subtract one time. The third term we subtract two times. The fourth term we subtract three times. Whatever term we're talking about we subtract that term minus one times. If we're talking about the nth term, we subtracted this value n minus one times. You can verify that this is going to work. When n is equal to one this term here is going to be zero, so this whole thing is gonna be zero. You get 9.6. When n is equal to two, two minus one, you subtract 0.1 one time. 9.6 minus 0.1 is 9.5. You could keep doing that. You could draw a table, and evaluate these if you want to. The key thing is your'e starting at 9.6 and you're subtracting 0.1 one fewer times than the term you're looking at. If you're looking at the if n is equal to, this is n is equal to four, well you're gonna subtract 0.1 three times, and you see that. Subtract 0.1 once, subtract 0.1 twice, subtract 0.1 three times.",math_engageny-alg-1_alg1-3
" -  Let's say that something is traveling at a constant rate of five meters per second. That's its velocity in one dimension. If it was negative, we'd be moving to the left. If it's positive, it's moving to the right. Let's say that we care about what is our change in distance over, the delta symbol represents change, over a change in time of four seconds. Over four seconds. I could say from t equal zero to t is equal to four. That's our change in time. That's our four-second interval that we care about. Well, one way to think about it is what a rate by definition is nothing but a change in some quantity. In this case, it's distance over a change in some other quantity. In this case, we're thinking about time. Or another way to think about it, if we multiply both sides times change in time, you get your change in distance is equal to your rate times change in time. This is very close to you, you might remember from pre-algebra, distance is equal to rate times time. Time, that just comes from the definition of what a rate is. It's a change in one quantity with respect to another quantity. If you just apply this, you can say, ""Okay, my rate is a constant five meters ""per second and my delta t is four seconds."" So times four seconds. Well, that's just going to give you 20. That's just going to get you 20. Let me do that in same color that I had for the change in distance. That's going to be 20. Then the seconds, cancel the seconds, 20 meters. So my total change in distance over those four seconds is going to be 20 meters. Nothing new here. Nothing too fancy. But I want to do now is connect this to the area under the rate function over this time period. So let's graph that. Let's graph it. That's my rate axis. This is my time axis. This is going to be in seconds. This is going to be in meters per second. Let's see, one, two, three, four, five. Let's see if it's about enough, and then I go one, two, three, four, five. Our rate, at least in this example, is a constant, is a constant five meters per second. It's a constant five meters per second. That is my r of t in this example. What did we just do here? We just multiplied our change in time times our constant rate. We just multiplied our change in time. So from time equal zero seconds to four seconds. It's this length here, if we think on that axis. Now we multiply it times our constant rate. We multiply it times this right over here. If I multiply this base times this height, what am I going to get? I'm going to get this area under the rate function. Now that area is going to be 20. If we went with the units of them, obviously you're used to things of area being something units squared because it's usually meters times meters or miles times miles or inches times inches so it'll be inches squared, meters squared, or miles squared. But here if we go at the units of the axis of the meters per second times seconds which is going to get you meters. But the important thing here is that the units here or the area here is 20. So this for that very simple example, it looks like the area under the rate curve is equal to the net change over that time period where the rate is something with respect to time. Well let's test the little burrow. It's just going to be more intuition here. Let's say that we have a different rate function. Let's say that we will make with the different, let's say instead we had a rate function. I'll use on this yellow. Let's say on a rate function, that is... Let me make it a little bit interesting. Let's say it's one meter per second, for our time is zero is less than or equal to time which is less than or equal to two seconds. Honestly, this is all in seconds where we're of time. There's two meters per second, for t is greater than two seconds. What's that going to look like? Actually, try to graph it yourself, and just say, ""Well, what is the total change in distance ""over the first, let's say five seconds?"" We want to do delta t over, not the first four seconds but the first five seconds. Well, let's graph it. Let's graph it. So this is one meter per second. One meter per second. That is two meters per second. That's in meters per second. That's my rate axis. This right over there is going to be my time axis. One, they're obviously not of the same scale, three, four, five. What is this rate function look like? Well, my rate is one meter per second between time is zero and two, including two seconds, and then the rate jumps. Nothing can accelerate instantly like this. You'd need an infinite force or an infinitely small mass I guess to, or maybe there's something that's thinking about... Anyway, I only get two complex here but this is unrealistic mode. It's not typical for something to just have spontaneous velocity increase like that but let's just go with it. Then after the two seconds, we are at a constant rate of two meters per second. Now, what is our total change in distance over the first five seconds here? So here, we care about the first five seconds, or we can break up the problem. We could say, ""Well, over the first two seconds."" Change in time is two seconds, times our constant rate over those two seconds. It's going to be two seconds times one meter per second. Well, that's going to give us two meters. So this here is going to be, shall we do that in orange color, that's going to give us two meters there, and then we look at the next section. Our change in time here is three seconds, and then we multiply that, times our constant two meters per second. That's going to give us an area of six. If we look at the units, in both cases, we're multiplying seconds times meters per second which is going to give us meters. This is going to be two plus six meters or eight meters. So hopefully this is giving you the intuition that the area under the rate curve or the rate function is going to give you our total net change in whatever that rate thing was finding the rate of. In this case, it is distance per unit time. If you take the area under the rate function, that kind of distance for the speed or this velocity function over some period of time, that area is going to be our total net change in distance.",math_calculus-1_cs1-applications-of-integrals
" So we're asked to add 3/15 plus 7/15, and then simplify the answer. So just the process when you add fractions is if they already-- well, first of all, if they're not mixed numbers, and neither of these are, and if they have the same denominator. In this example, the denominators are already the same. The denominator is 15. So if you add these two fractions, your sum is going to have the same denominator, 15, and your numerator is just going to be the sum of the numerator, so it's going to be 3 plus 7, or it's going to be equal to 10/15. Now, if we wanted to simplify this, we'd look for the greatest common factor in both the 10 and the 15, and as far as I can tell, 5 is the largest number that goes into both of them. So divide the 10 by 5 and you divide the 15 by 5, and you get-- 10 divided by 5 is 2 and 15 divided by 5 is 3. You get 2/3. Now, to understand why this works, let's draw it out. Let's split something up into 15 sections. So let me split it up into 15 sections. Let me see how well I can do this. Well, actually, even a better way, an easier way might be to draw circles. So let me do the 15 sections. So let me draw. So that is one section right over there. That is one section and then if I copy and paste it, that is a second section, and then a third section, fourth section, and then we have a fifth section. Let me copy and paste this whole thing. So that's five sections right there. Let me copy and then paste that. So that is 10 sections, and then let me do it one more time. So that is 15 sections. So you can imagine this whole thing is like a candy bar or something, and we have now split it up into 15 sections. Now, what is 3/15? Well, it's going to be 3 of the 15 sections. So 3/15 is going to be one, two, three: 3/15. Now, to that, were adding 7 of the 1/15 sections, or 7 of the sections. So we're adding 7 of those to it. So that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And you see now, if you take the orange and the blue, you get one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten of the sections, or 10 of the 15 sections. And then to see why this is the same thing as 2/3, you can just split this candy bar into thirds, so each third would have five sections in it. So let's do that. One, two, three, four, five, so that is 1/3 right there. One, two, three, four, five, that is another third right there. And notice, when you do it like this, we have filled out exactly two-- one, two-- of the thirds. This is the third third, but that's not filled in. So 10/15 is the same thing as 2/3.",math_5th-grade-foundations-engageny_5th-m3-engage-ny-foundations
" -  Ethene, C2H4, molar mass of 28.1 grams per mole, may be prepared by the dehydration of ethanol, C2H5OH, molar mass 46.1 grams per mole, using a solid catalyst. A setup for the lab synthesis is shown in the diagram above. The equation for the dehydration reaction is given below. So, we have the ethanol, and then in the presence of a catalyst, we're going to yield, after our reaction, some ethene and some water, and then we have some metrics on the actual reaction. A student added a 0.200 gram sample of ethanol, this is ethanol, C2H5OH, to a test tube, using the setup shown above. So this is the glass wool with ethanol, so the ethanol is right over here. There's a solid catalyst right over there. The student heated the test tube gently with a Bunsen burner until all of the ethanol evaporated, and gas generation stopped. So, here you see the heating, all of the ethanol here evaporates, the gas generation stops. When the reaction stopped, the volume of gas collected was 0.0854 liters at 0.822 atmospheres and 305 Kelvin. The vapor pressure of water at 305 Kelvin is 35.7 torr. So, what you have is, in the presence of the catalyst, you have the ethanol, it's going to react, it's a dehydration, it's a dehydration reaction right over here, so you're going to produce ethene and water, and so, you cool it down, and so the ethene gets captured at the top, it's going to be in a gaseous state. The water, it's going to be water vapor, but then, of course, once you've cooled it down, you're going to have liquid, you're going to have liquid water here as well. So, let's try to answer their questions. Calculate the number of moles of ethene, one, that are actually produced in the experiment and measured in the gas collection tube, and two, that would be produced if the dehydration reaction went to completion. Part b, calculate the percent yield of ethene in the experiment. All right, so let's tackle part one. Let's tackle part one first, and so, somehow we have to figure out the, we have to figure out the actual moles produced in the experiment and measured in the gas collection tube. So, what do they tell us here? They said until all of the ethanol evaporated and gas generation stopped. When the reaction stopped, the volume of gas, so this volume of gas, so this is our volume of gas right over here, that's where our ethene is, our volume of gas was 0.0854 liters, so we underline that, at 0.822 atmospheres, so that's the total pressure there. The temperature is 305 Kelvin, and then they give us the vapor pressure of water is 35.7, at 305 Kelvin, is 35.7 torr. The vapor pressure of water, you could view that as a partial pressure of water, and the reason why that's useful is the partial pressure of water plus the partial pressure of the ethene is going to add up to the total pressure here. And so, we can use that information to figure out the partial pressure of the ethene. So, the partial pressure of the ethene. And if we know the partial pressure of the ethene, well, then we can use the Ideal Gas Law to figure out how many moles of ethene, how many moles of ethene are actually right over here. How can we do that? Well, just a little reminder of the Ideal Gas Law. We have pressure, and if we're talking about one particular thing, here we'd be talking about the partial pressure of ethene, times volume, they give us the volume right over here, is equal to the number of moles times the gas constant times the temperature. Well, we have the pressure, we have-- or, we'll be able to figure it out, we have the volume, we have the gas constant. You don't have to memorize these things. Right over here, I copied and pasted what they give you at the front of the actual AP exam, so that you don't have to memorize these constants and things like that. So, we have the gas constant, and then we have it in different units, depending on which one we want to use, and then, of course, the temperature, they give it to us. It is 305 Kelvin. So, if we want to figure out the number of moles, right over here, you can divide both sides by RT, and so you could say n is equal to, is equal to R, sorry, n is equal to, we divide both sides, if we divide both sides by RT, we're going to get PV, and I'll say the partial pressure of ethene, the partial pressure of ethene, times the volume, times the volume, over, over R times T over R times T. And so, let's figure out everything over here. So, what is going to be the partial pressure of the ethene? Well, the pressure of, the partial pressure of the ethene is going to be equal to the total pressure, the total pressure minus the partial pressure, or you could say the vapor pressure, of the water, the partial pressure of, the partial pressure of the water. So, this is going to be equal to, our total pressure is 0.822 atmospheres, 0.822 atmospheres. Now, what's the pressure of, what's the partial pressure of the water? They tell us the vapor pressure of water at 305 Kelvin is 35.7 torr. Well, they gave us the total pressure in atmospheres, so we have to convert from, we have to convert from torrs to atmospheres if we want to stay in atmospheres. So I'll do it over here. So, the pressure, the pressure of, the partial pressure of the water is equal to 35.7 torr, which is a unit of pressure. But if we want to convert it to atmospheres, once again, you don't have to memorize these things. They give it to you on the test. They tell us, one atmosphere is 760 torr. So, we wanna get rid of the torr. We wanna get rid of the torr, and we want it in terms of atmospheres, so one atmosphere is 760 torr, so this is going to be equal to 35.7 divided by 760. So it's this is the total pressure, minus the partial pressure of the water. Let's see, the partial pressure of the water, let me figure this out. It is going to be 35.7 torr times one atmosphere for every 760 torr, so I'll just divide by 760, divided by 760, is equal to, and I have three significant digits here. So, 0.0470. 0.0470. So this is going to be 0.0470 atmospheres. So, let me write that down. So, the total pressure minus the partial pressure of the water, 0.0470 atmospheres, is going to be equal to, is going to be equal to-- So, let me just take my-- Well, I could just make that a negative, and then add it to the total pressure, so, plus, plus .822 or 0.822 is going to be equal to... So, the partial pressure of our ethene, three significant digits here, is going to be 775, 0.775. So, 0.775. And so now, we can substitute that in. We know everything to figure out the number of moles. N is going to be equal to 0.775. The units here are atmospheres; we can always check to make sure that we get that right, atmospheres. Times our volume. Well, they tell us our volume. It's 0.0854 liters, 0.0854 liters, and then we divide that by RT. Now, which version of R do we use? Well, we're dealing with atmospheres, moles, and Kelvin, so we could use, we could use this right over here. If we had converted everything to torr, we would use this constant. So, our R is going to be 0.08206. They're giving us more significant digits. Doesn't hurt to use them, but later we have to just realize that we're gonna convert to only three significant digits, because that's the minimum, that's what we have. These are three, three, this is more than three signifi-- This is four significant digits. But let's just make sure the units work out. So, this is going to be-- So this is the units here are liters times atmosphere, and so those will cancel with these, divided by, we have to remember this is in, this is in the denominator right over here, divided by moles times Kelvin, and we multiply that times the temperature, which is 305 Kelvin, 305 Kelvin. And we'll see, we could see that, well, this atmospheres is going to cancel with that atmospheres, that liters is going to cancel with that liters, this Kelvin is going to cancel with that Kelvin, and so, in the denominator, you're dividing by moles, so that's gonna be the same thing as just having moles as your units. 1And so, this is all going to be equal to, 1we deserve a little bit of a, 1we deserve a little bit of a drumroll here. 1This is equal to-- 1So, 0.775 atmospheres 1times .0854 liters 1divided by .08206, 1so that gets us that, 1and then we're going to divide by 305. 1We still have that in the denominator, 1divided by 305, 1is equal to, and if we do three significant digits, 1it's 0.00264. 1So this is approximately, I could say, 10.00264 1264 moles. 1Did I write that right? I have a bad memory. 10.00264, yeah, 1I rounded down to 264 moles. 1And there you have it, that's part one. 1The number of moles of ethene that are actually produced 1in the experiment and measured in the gas collection tube.",science_chemistry_chemical-reactions-stoichiome
" -  The following tables lists the values of functions f and h, and of their derivatives, f prime and h prime for x is equal to three. So all this is telling us, with x is equal to three, the value of the function is six, f of three is six, you could view it that way. h of three is zero, f prime of three is six, and h prime of three is four. And now they want us to evaluate the derivative with respect to x of the product of f of x and h of x when x is equal to three. One way you could view this is, if we viewed some function, if we viewed some function g of x. g of x as being equal to the product of f of x and h of x, this expression is the derivative of g of x. So we could write g prime of x is equal to the derivative with respect to x of f of x times h of x. Which is what we see right here, and which is what we want to evaluate at x equals three. So we essentially want to evaluate g prime of three. This is what they're asking us to do. Well, to do that, let's go first up here. Let's just think about what this is doing. They're asking us to take the derivative with respect to x of the product of two functions that we have some information about. Well, if we're taking the derivative of the product of two functions, you could imagine that the product rule could prove useful here. So I'm just gonna restate the product rule. This is going to be equal to the derivative of the first function, f prime of x, times the second function, not taking its derivative. Plus the first function, not taking its derivative, f of x, times the derivative of the second function, h prime of x. So if you're trying to find g prime of three, well that's just going to be f prime of three times h of three plus f of three times h prime of three. And lucky for us, they give us what all these things evaluate to. f prime of three, right over here, they tell us. f prime when x is equal to three is equal to six. So this right over here is six. h of three, they give us that, too. h of three, when x is three, the value of our function is zero. So this is zero. So this first term is you just get six times zero, which is gonna be zero, but we'll get to that. Now f of three. f of three. Well, the function when x is equal to three, f of three is equal to six. So that is six. And then finally, h prime evaluated at three, h prime of x when x is equal to three, h prime of x is equal to four. Or you could say this is h prime of three. So this is four. And so there you have it. This is going to evaluate to six times zero, which, that's all just gonna be zero, plus six times four, which is going to be equal to 24. And we're done.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-derivative-rules
" -  We are told Ismael made a scaled copy of the following quadrilateral. He used a scale factor less than one, all right. And then they say what could be the length of the side that corresponds to AD? So AD is right over here. AD has length 16 units in our original quadrilateral. What could be the length of the side that corresponds with AD on the scaled copy of the quadrilateral? So it's a scale factor less than one. So we're gonna get something that is less than 16 for that side. And the rest of it will all be scaled by the same factor. So the resulting quadrilateral might look something, might look something like this. This is just my hand-drawn version. So the key realization is is if our scale factor is less than one, this thing right over here is going to be less than 16 units. So let's look at the choices. And it says choose three answers. So pause the video. Which of these would match if we're scaling by a factor of less than one? Well, we just have to see which of these are less than 16 units. This is less than 16. This is less than 16. This is less than 16. And those are the only three that are less than 16. 32 units, this would be a scale factor of two. 64 units, this would be a scale factor of four, clearly a scale factor that is not less than one.",math_7th-grade-illustrative-math_unit-1-scale-drawings
" -  ""Ksenia wants to chop broccoli ""and carrots for a competition. ""It takes her the same number of seconds ""to chop each carrot, and it takes her the same number ""of seconds to chop each broccoli head. ""Her goal is to chop at least 20 vegetables ""with a time limit of 540 seconds,"" all right. ""The graph below represents the set ""of all combinations of carrots and broccoli. ""Inequality A,"" let's see, ""Inequality A represents ""the range of all combinations Ksenia wants to chop."" Because she wants to chop at least 20 vegetables. So, that's what Inequality A is representing, that she wants to chop at least 20 vegetables. So, all this blue shaded area and even the line, is a solid line so it includes point on the line. These are all of the scenarios where she's chopping at least 20 vegetables, all this blue area including the blue line. And it says, ""Inequality B represents the range of all combinations she can chop with her time limit."" So, Inequality B, this is all of the combinations where she is within her time limit, where she is not spending any more than 540 seconds. ""What is the least number of carrots Ksenia can chop while achieving her goal?"" Well, her goal, remember she wants to chop at least 20 vegetables. So, you want to be in the blue area. You want to be in the solution set for Inequality A, which would be the blue area or on the blue line. And she wants to achieve her goal of meeting the time limit. So, she needs to also be in the solution set for Inequality B so she also has to be in the green area or on the green line. And so the overlap of the two, if she's meeting both constraints, it's going to be all of this area. This is the overlap of the two solution sets. So, in this overlap where is the least number of carrots. ""What is the least number of carrots Ksenia can chop while achieving her goal."" So, if we see here, the least number of carrots, you might tempted to say, ""Okay, 20 carrots, that is in the solution set."" That would be 20 carrots and zero broccoli heads but you can actually find a combination that has even fewer carrots. You can go all the way to this point because remember the points on the lines are also included in the solution sets, because they are solid lines not dash lines. So, this point right over here, 10 carrots and 10 broccoli heads actually meets her goal. So, let me write that down. 10 carrots and 10 broccoli, 10 broccoli heads. Let me just write that, 10 broccoli heads. So, that's the least amount. If you wanted to somehow figure out less than 10 carrots, in any of those scenarios there's no overlap. You know, if you say, ""Oh, is there any way ""to do nine carrots?"" If you look over here there's no overlap at c equals nine between the two solution sets. So, the minimum right over here is actually the point of intersection of these two lines. 10 carrots, 10 broccoli heads that's the combination that has her chopping the minimum number of carrots while achieving, frankly, her goals, both of her goals.

" Let's see if we can take the integral of cosine of 5x over e to the sine of 5x dx. And there's a crow squawking outside of my window, so I'll try to stay focused. So let's think about whether u-substitution might be appropriate. Your first temptation might have said, hey, maybe we let u equal sine of 5x. And if u is equal to sine of 5x, we have something that's pretty close to du up here. Let's verify that. So du could be equal to-- so du dx, derivative of u with respect to x. Well, we just use the chain rule. Derivative of 5x is 5. Times the derivative of sine of 5x with respect to 5x, that's just going to be cosine of 5x. If we want to write this into differential form, which is useful when we do our u-substitution, we could say that du is equal to 5 cosine 5x. And we look over here, we don't have quite du there. We have just cosine of 5x dx. Cosine of 5x dx just like that. So when you look over here, you have a cosine of 5x dx, but we don't have a 5 cosine of 5x dx. But we know how to solve that. We can multiply by 5 and divide by 5. 1/5 times 5 is just going to be 1, so we haven't changed the value of the expression. When we do it this way, we see pretty clearly we have our u and we have our du. Our du is 5. Let me circle that. Let me do that in that blue color-- is 5 cosine of 5x dx. So we can rewrite this entire expression as-- do that 1/5 in purple. This is going to be equal to 1/5-- I hope you don't hear that crow outside. He's getting quite obnoxious. 1/5 times the integral of all the stuff in blue is my du, and then that is over e to the u. So how do we take the antiderivative of this? Well, you might be tempted to well, what would you do here? Well, we're still not quite ready to simply take the antiderivative here. If I were to rewrite this, I could rewrite this as this is equal to 1/5 times the integral of e to the negative u du. And so what might jump out at you is maybe we do another substitution. We've already used the letter u, so maybe we'll use w. We'll do some w-substitution. And you might be able to do this in your head, but we'll do w-substitution just to make it a little bit clearer. This would have been really useful if this was just e to the u because we know the antiderivative of e to the u is just e to the u. So let's try to get it in terms of the form of e to the something and not e to the negative something. So let's set. And I'm running out of colors here. Let's set w as equal to negative u. In that case, then dw, derivative of w with respect to u, is negative 1. Or if we were to write that statement in differential form, dw is equal to du times negative 1 is negative du. So this right over here would be our w. And do we have a dw here? Well, we have just a du. We don't have a negative du there. But we can create a negative du by multiplying this inside by a negative 1, but then also by multiplying the outside by a negative 1. Negative 1 times negative 1 is positive 1. We haven't changed the value. We have to do both of these in order for it to make sense. Or I could do it like this. So negative 1 over here and a negative 1 right over there. And if we do it in that form, then this negative 1 times du, that's the same thing as negative du. This is this right over here. And so we can rewrite our integral. It's going to be equal to now it's going to be negative 1/5. Trying to use the colors as best as I can. Negative 1/5 times the indefinite integral of e to the-- well, instead of negative u, we can write w-- e to the w. And instead of du times negative 1, or negative du, we can write dw. Now this simplifies things a good bit. We know what the antiderivative of this is in terms of w. This is going to be equal to negative 1/5 e to the w. And then we might have some constant there, so I'll just do a plus c. And now we just have to do all of our unsubstituting. So we know that w is equal to negative u. So we could write that. So this is equal to negative 1/5. I want to stay true to my colors. Negative 1/5 e to the negative u, that's what w is equal to, plus c. But we're still not done unsubstituting. We know that u is equal to sine of 5x. u is equal to sine of 5x, so we can write this as being equal to negative 1/5 times e to the negative u, which is negative u is sine of 5x. And then finally, we have our plus c. Now, there was a simpler way that we could have done this by just doing one substitution. But then you would have had to look ahead a little bit and realize that it was not trivial to take your-- not too bad to take your antiderivative of e to the negative u. The insight that you might have had-- although you shouldn't really hold yourself, feel too bad if you didn't see that insight-- is that we could have rewritten that original integral-- and let me rewrite it. It's cosine of 5x over e to the sine of 5x dx. We could have written this entire original integral as being equal to cosine of 5x times e to the negative sine of 5x dx. And in this situation, we could have set u to be equal to negative 5x and say, well, if u is equal to negative sine of 5x. If u is equal to negative sine of 5x, then du is going to be equal to negative 5 cosine of 5x. And we don't have a negative-- oh, dx. We don't have a negative 5 here, but we could construct one by putting a negative 5 there and then multiplying by negative 1/5. And then that would have immediately simplified this integral right over here to be equal to negative 1/5 times the integral of well, we have our du. Let me do this in a different color. We have our du. That's the negative 5. Let me do it this way. Negative 5 cosine of 5x dx. So that is our du. I'm just changing the order of multiplication. Times e to the u. This whole thing now is u this second time around. So if we did it this way, with just one substitution, we could have immediately gotten to the result that we wanted. You take the antiderivative of this. I'll do it in one color now just because I think you get the idea. This is equal to negative 1/5 e to the u plus c. u is equal to negative sine of 5x. So this is equal to negative 1/5 e to the negative sine of 5x plus c And you're done. So this one is faster. It's simpler. And over time, you might even start being able to do this in your head. This top one, you still didn't mess up by just setting u equal to sine of 5x, we just have to do an extra substitution in order to work it through all the way. And I was able to do this video despite the crowing crow outside, or squawking crow.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-integrals
" - So I have the number 235, and we can think of that as 2 hundreds, we have a 2 in the hundreds place so 2 hundreds, 3 tens, we have a 3 in the tens place, so 3 tens, and 5 ones, we have a 5 in the ones place. And over here I've actually drawn it out with that many boxes, this is 235 boxes. So you have 2 groups of a hundred boxes, so this is 2 hundreds, then we have 3 tens, 1,2,3. And then we have 5 ones. Now let's try some interesting things here. So what happens if I were to add 10 here. Well adding 10, we're just adding 1 ten. We're just adding 1 ten. So if we add 1 ten, what's going to happen? Well, over here I need to add one more 10, I've got to add this 10. So what's it going to look like? Well that, the next 10 is going to look like this. Let me see if I can draw it pretty fast. So we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. So I just added a ten. So what does that leave us with? Well if I had 3, if i had 3 tens, and I have 1 more ten now, now I'm going to have 4 tens, now I'm going to have 4 tens. I'm gonna do that in that yellow color. So now I'm going to have 4 tens. I'm still going to have 5 ones, 5 ones, I'm still gonna have 5 ones, I'm not adding any ones there. So I'm still going to have 5 ones, and I'm still going to have 2 hundreds, I'm not adding any hundreds there, so I'm still going to have 2 hundreds, 2 hundreds. So now it's going to be 2 hundreds, plus 4 tens, plus 5 ones. 2 hundreds plus 4 tens plus 5 ones. Well what's that going to be? Well, 2 hundreds, plus 4 tens, plus 5 ones: 245. Let's do one more. Instead of adding a ten, let's add a hundred. So let's do that, let me see if I can clear all this stuff out, so... So instead of adding 10 lets add 100 here, so I'm going to add, so plus, let's add 1 hundred, 1, I'll actually do it in yellow and in blue. So I'm adding 1 hundred, 0 tens, and 0 ones. So essentially just adding 1 hundred. So this is going to be equal to, so plus 1 hundred. So plus 1 hundred, so what's that going to get me? Let me draw it out here, let me copy and paste. I have 2 hundreds before but now I'm going to add 1 hundred. So let me just copy that, and let me paste it. So now, how many hundreds do I have? How many hundreds do I have now? Well now i have one, two, three hundreds. I have 3 hundreds. So over here, I had 2 hundreds, I'm adding one more hundred right over here so now I have 3 hundreds. Over here I could say that now I have 3, 3 hundreds. Now, are the number of tens, have they changed? No, I had 3 tens before, and I'm not adding tens this time so I'm still going to have 3 tens, and I had 5 ones before and I'm not adding any more ones so I still have 5 ones. So I have 335, which is the same thing as 3 hundreds plus 3 tens, plus 3 tens, plus 5 ones, plus 5 ones.",math_in-in-class-2nd-math-cbse_cc-2nd-add-subtract-1000
" Let's do a few examples multiplying fractions. So let's multiply negative 7 times 3/49. So you might say, I don't see a fraction here. This looks like an integer. But you just to remind yourself that the negative 7 can be rewritten as negative 7/1 times 3/49. Now we can multiply the numerators. So the numerator is going to be negative 7 times 3. And the denominator is going to be 1 times 49. 1 times 49. And this is going to be equal to-- 7 times 3 is 21. And one of their signs is negative, so a negative times a positive is going to be a negative. So this is going to be negative 21. You could view this as negative 7 plus negative 7 plus negative 7. And that's going to be over 49. And this is the correct value, but we can simplify it more because 21 and 49 both share 7 as a factor. That's their greatest common factor. So let's divide both the numerator and the denominator by 7. Divide the numerator and the denominator by 7. And so this gets us negative 3 in the numerator. And in the denominator, we have 7. So we could view it as negative 3 over 7. Or, you could even do it as negative 3/7. Let's do another one. Let's take 5/9 times-- I'll switch colors more in this one. That one's a little monotonous going all red there. 5/9 times 3/15. So this is going to be equal to-- we multiply the numerators. So it's going to be 5 times 3. 5 times 3 in the numerator. And the denominator is going to be 9 times 15. 9 times 15. We could multiply them out, but just leaving it like this you see that there is already common factors in the numerator and the denominator. Both the numerator and the denominator, they're both divisible by 5 and they're both divisible by 3, which essentially tells us that they're divisible by 15. So we can divide the numerator and denominator by 15. So divide the numerator by 15, which is just like dividing by 5 and then dividing by 3. So we'll just divide by 15. Divide by 15. And this is going to be equal to-- well, 5 times 3 is 15. Divided by 15 you get 1 in the numerator. And in the denominator, 9 times 15 divided by 15. Well, that's just going to be 9. So it's equal to 1/9. Let's do another one. What would negative 5/9 times negative 3/15 be? Well, we've already figured out what positive 5/9 times positive 3/15 would be. So now we just have to care about the sign. If we were just multiplying the two positives, it would be 1/9. But now we have to think about the fact that we're multiplying by a negative times a negative. Now, we remember when you multiply a negative times a negative, it's a positive. The only way that you get a negative is if one of those two numbers that you're taking the product of is negative, not two. If both are positive, it's positive. If both are negative, it's positive. Let's do one more example. Let's take 5-- I'm using the number 5 a lot. So let's do 3/2, just to show that this would work with improper fractions. 3/2 times negative 7/10. I'm arbitrarily picking colors. And so our numerator is going to be 3 times negative 7. 3 times negative 7. And our denominator is going to be 2 times 10. 2 times 10. So this is going to be the numerator. Positive times a negative is a negative. 3 times negative 7 is negative 21. Negative 21. And the denominator, 2 times 10. Well, that is just 20. So this is negative 21/20. And you really can't simplify this any further.",math_7th-grade-illustrative-math_unit-5-rational-number-arithmetic
" Over many videos now, we've been talking about how every interstellar object is moving away from Earth. And we've also been talking about how the further something is away from Earth, the faster it's moving. What I want to do in this video is to put a little bit of numbers behind it, or even better conceptualize what we've been talking about. So one way to think about it is that, if at an early stage in the universe, I were to pick some points. So that's one point, another point, another point, another point. Let me just pick nine points so that I have a proper grid. So this at an early stage in the universe. If we fast forward a few billion years-- and I'm clearly not drawing it to scale-- all of these points have all moved away from each other. So this point is over here-- actually, let me draw another column, just to make it clear. So if we fast forward a few billion years, the universe has expanded. And so everything has moved away from everything. And let me color code it a little bit. Let me make this point magenta. So this point, the magenta point is now here. This green point has now moved away from the magenta point. And now this blue point has now moved away from the magenta point in that direction. And we could keep going. This yellow point is maybe over here now. I think you get the general idea. And I'll just draw the other yellow points. So they've all moved away from each other. So there's no center here. Everything is just expanding away from things next to it. And what you can see here is not only did this thing expand away from this, but this thing expanded away from this even further. Because it had this expansion, plus this expansion. Or another way to think about it is, the apparent velocity with which something is expanding is going to be proportional to how far it is. Because every point in between is also expanding away. And just to review a little bit of the visualization of this-- one way to think of this, if you think of the universe as an infinite flat sheet. You can imagine that we're just taking a sheet of, I don't know, some type of sheet of stretchy material and just stretching it out. We're just stretching it out. That's if we kind of imagine a more infinite universe that just goes off in every direction. We're just stretching that infinite sheet out. So it has no boundaries, but we're still stretching it out. Another way to visualize it-- and this what we did earlier on-- Is you can imagine that the universe is the three dimensional surface of a four dimensional sphere. Or the three dimensional surface of a hyper-sphere. So at an early stage in the universe, the sphere looked like this. And these points here-- that magenta point is right over here. The green point is right over there. Then we add the blue point up here. And then let me just draw the rest of the yellow points. And the yellow points are here. They're all on the surface of this sphere. Obviously I'm only dealing with two dimensions right now and it's nearly impossible, or maybe impossible, to imagine a three dimensional surface of a four dimensional sphere. But the analogy holds. If this is a surface the balloon, or the surface of a bubble, if the bubble were to expand over a few billion years-- and once again, not drawn to scale. So now we have a bigger bubble here. This part of the surface is all going to expand. So once again, you have your magenta. You have your blue dot. You have your green dot right over here. And then let me just draw the rest in yellow. So they will have all expanded away from each other on the surface of this sphere. And just to make it clear that this is a sphere, let me draw some contour lines. So this is a contour line. Just to make it clear that we are on the surface of an actual sphere. Now with that out of the way, let's think about what is the apparent velocity with which things are moving away? And remember, we're going have to say, not only how far things are moving away, but we're going to say how far they are moving away from-- if the observer is us-- depending on how far they already are. So what we're going to do-- we could say is-- let me write this down. All objects moving away from each other. And the apparent relative velocity is proportional to distance. And what I've just written down here-- and this is why I wrote it down-- this is a rephrasing of, essentially, Hubble's Law. And he came up with this by just observing that when he looks-- especially the further out he looks, the more redshifted objects are. And not only were they moving faster and faster away from Earth, but they seem to be moving faster and faster away from each other. So this is just a restating of Hubble's Law. Or another way to say it is, from any point, let's say from the earth, the velocity that something appears to be moving is going to be some constant times the distance that it is away from the observer. In this case, we are the observer. And we put this little zero-- so this H here is called Hubble's Constant. And it's a very non-constant constant. Because this constant will change depending on where we are in the evolution of the universe. So we put this little zero here, this little sub 0 right over here, to show that this is Hubble's Constant right now. And when we talk about distance, we're talking about the proper distance right now. And this has to be very important because that proper distance is constantly changing as the universe expands. So the now will actually change slightly from the beginning of this video to the end of this video. But we could roughly say in kind of our current period of time. And when we say proper distance, we're talking about if you actually had rulers. And if you were to just lay them down instantaneously-- obviously we can't do something like that. But we can imagine doing something like that. So that's what we're talking about it. So just to give a sense of, or do a little bit of math of how fast things are actually moving apart-- let me actually write it someplace where I have more space-- the current Hubble Constant is 70.6 plus or minus 3.1. So we have observed some variation here. There is some error to our actual measurements. Kilometers per second per megaparsec. And remember, a parsec is roughly 3.2, 3.3 light years. So another way to think about it is, if this is where we are in the universe right now. And if this object right over here-- if this distance right over here is one megaparsec, so 1 million parsecs. Or 3.26 million light years from Earth. So just so we have a sense, this is roughly 3.26 million light years from Earth. Then this object will appear to be moving away. Although it's not moving in space, just the space that it's in is stretching in such a way that it looks to be moving at, based on its redshift, 70.6 kilometers per second away from us. So this is a huge velocity. 70.6 kilometers per second. So this is a pretty fast velocity. But you have to remember, this is over one megaparsec. The Andromeda galaxy is not even a megaparsec away. It is about 2.5 million light years. So it's about 0.7 or 0.8 of a megaparsec. So if you look at a point in space a little bit further than the Andromeda galaxy, it will look to be, right now, receding at about 70.6 kilometers per second. But what if you were to go twice that distance? If you were to look at something that's almost 7 light years away? 2 megaparsecs away? So if you were to look at this object over here, how fast would that be receding? Well, if you just look at it over here, it's 2 megaparsecs away. So it's going to be twice this. You're just going to multiply its distance-- 2 megaparsecs times this. The megaparsecs cancel out. So 70.6 times 2 is-- it's going to look to be moving, It's not moving in space. Remember, space is just stretching. So its velocity, It's apparent velocity, will be 70.6 times 2. So that's 141.2 kilometers per second. And one question you say, well how did Hubble know-- you can observe the redshift of objects moving away from us. But how did he know that they were moving away 1from each other? 1Well, if you were look at the redshift of this object, 1and say, wow, that's moving away is 70.6 kilometers per second. 1And then you were to look at the redshift of this 1and say, wow, that's moving away from us 1at 141.2 kilometers per second. 1Then you also know that these two objects are moving away 1from each other at 70.6 kilometers per second. 1And we could keep doing this over different distances. 1But hopefully this gives you a little bit bigger sense 1of things. 1And just remember, even though I said this is a huge distance-- 1a megaparsec is further than it is to the Andromeda galaxy. 1The Andromeda galaxy is the nearest large galaxy to us. 1There are some smaller galaxies that 1are closer to us that are kind of satellite 1galaxies around the Milky Way. 1But the Andromeda is the nearest large galaxy to us. 1And we also know that we're talking about hundreds 1of billions of galaxies in just the observable universe. 1So very quickly, as you go near the edge 1of the observable universe, these velocities, 1the apparent distance at which things move are moving away 1from us, start to become pretty significant.",science_cosmology-and-astronomy_universe-scale-topic
" Let's say I have something moving with a constant velocity of five meters per second. And we're just assuming it's moving to the right, just to give us a direction, because this is a vector quantity, so it's moving in that direction right over there. And let me plot its velocity against time. So this is my velocity. So I'm actually going to only plot the magnitude of the velocity, and you can specify that like this. So this is the magnitude of the velocity. And then on this axis I'm going to plot time. So we have a constant velocity of five meters per second. So its magnitude is five meters per second. And it's constant. It's not changing. As the seconds tick away the velocity does not change. So it's just moving five meters per second. Now, my question to you is how far does this thing travel after five seconds? So after five seconds-- so this is one second, two second, three seconds, four seconds, five seconds, right over here. So how far did this thing travel after five seconds? Well, we could think about it two ways. One, we know that velocity is equal to displacement over change in time. And displacement is just change in position over change in time. Or another way to think about it-- If you multiply both sides by change in time-- you get velocity times change in time, is equal to displacement. So what was of the displacement over here? Well, I know what the velocity is-- it's five meters per second. That's the velocity, let me color-code this. That is the velocity. And we know what the change in time is, it is five seconds. And so you get the seconds cancel out the seconds, you get five times five-- 25 meters-- is equal to 25 meters. And that's pretty straightforward. But the slightly more interesting thing is that's exactly the area under this rectangle right over here. What I'm going to show you in this video, that is in general, if you plot velocity, the magnitude of velocity. So you could say speed to versus time. Or let me just stay with the magnitude of the velocity versus time. The area under that curve is going to be the distance traveled, because, or the displacement. Because displacement is just the velocity times the change in time. So if you just take out a rectangle right over there. So let me draw a slightly different one where the velocity is changing. So let me draw a situation where you have a constant acceleration . The acceleration over here is going to be one meter per second, per second. So one meter per second, squared. And let me draw the same type of graph, although this is going to look a little different now. So this is my velocity axis. I'll give myself a little bit more space. So this is my velocity axis. I'm just going to draw the magnitude of the velocity, and this right over here is my time axis. So this is time. And let me mark some stuff off here. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. And the magnitude of velocity is going to be measured in meters per second. And the time is going to be measured in seconds. So my initial velocity, or I could say the magnitude of my initial velocity-- so just my initial speed, you could say, this is just a fancy way of saying my initial speed is zero. So my initial speed is zero. So after one second what's going to happen? After one second I'm going one meter per second faster. So now I'm going one meter per second. After two seconds, whats happened? Well now I'm going another meter per second faster than that. After another second-- if I go forward in time, if change in time is one second, then I'm going a second faster than that. And if you remember the idea of the slope from your algebra one class, that's exactly what the acceleration is in this diagram right over here. The acceleration, we know that acceleration is equal to change in velocity over change in time. Over here change in time is along the x-axis. So this right over here is a change in time. And this right over here is a change in velocity. When we plot velocity or the magnitude of velocity relative to time, the slope of that line is the acceleration. And since we're assuming the acceleration is constant, we have a constant slope. So we have just a line here. We don't have a curve. Now what I want to do is think about a situation. Let's say that we accelerate it one meter per second squared. And we do it for-- so the change in time is going to be five seconds. And my question to you is how far have we traveled? Which is a slightly more interesting question than what we've been asking so far. So we start off with an initial velocity of zero. And then for five seconds we accelerate it one meter per second squared. So one, two, three, four, five. So this is where we go. This is where we are. So after five seconds, we know our velocity. Our velocity is now five meters per second. But how far have we traveled? So we could think about it a little bit visually. We could say, look, we could try to draw rectangles over here. Maybe right over here, we have the velocity of one meter per second. So if I say one meter per second times the second, that'll give me a little bit of distance. And then the next one I have a little bit more of distance, calculated the same way. I could keep drawing these rectangles here, but then you're like, wait, those rectangles are missing, because I wasn't for the whole second, I wasn't only going one meter per second. I kept accelerating. So I actually, I should maybe split up the rectangles. I could split up the rectangles even more. So maybe I go every half second. So on this half-second I was going at this velocity. And I go that velocity for a half-second. Velocity times the time would give me the displacement. And I do it for the next half second. Same exact idea here. Gives me the displacement. So on and so forth. But I think what you see as you're getting-- is the more accurate-- the smaller the rectangles, you try to make here, the closer you're going to get to the area under this curve. And just like the situation here. This area under the curve is going to be the distance traveled. And lucky for us, this is just going to be a triangle, and we know how to figure out the area for triangle. So the area of a triangle is equal to one half times base times height. Which hopefully makes sense to you, because if you just multiply base times height, you get the area for the entire rectangle, and the triangle is exactly half of that. So the distance traveled in this situation, or I should say the displacement, just because we want to make sure we're focused on vectors. The displacement here is going to be-- or I should say the magnitude of the displacement, maybe, which is the same thing as the distance, is going to be one half times the base, which is five seconds, times the height, which is five meters per second. Times five meters. Let me do that in another color. Five meters per second. The seconds cancel out with the seconds. And we're left with one half times five times five meters. So it's one half times 25, which is equal to 12.5 meters. And so there's an interesting thing here, well one, there's a couple of interesting things. Hopefully you'll realize that if you're plotting velocity versus time, the area under the curve, given a certain amount of time, tells you how far you have traveled. The other interesting thing is that the slope of the curve tells you your acceleration. What's the slope over here? Well, It's completely flat. And that's because the velocity isn't changing. So in this situation, we have a constant acceleration. The magnitude of that acceleration is exactly zero. Our velocity is not changing. Here we have an acceleration of one meter per second squared, and that's why the slope of this line right over here is one. The other interesting thing, is, if even if you have constant acceleration, you could still figure out the distance by just taking the area under the curve like this. We were able to figure out there we were able to get 12.5 meters. The last thing I want to introduce you to-- actually, let me just do it until next video, and I'll introduce you to the idea of average velocity. Now that we feel comfortable with the idea, that the distance you traveled is the area under the velocity versus time curve.",science_ap-physics-1_ap-one-dimensional-motion
" - We have this big moment and the moment is that for 35 years of my teaching career I walked into the classroom having no idea if the kids had done the homework or what their commitment was to the subject. And then suddenly there's this coaching platform on Khan Academy that was a total game-changer for me. I wasn't imagining that the Khan Academy calculus content would become a big part of our curriculum. I imagined frankly and wrongly that we'd use these exercises, suggest kids use it for review. And when we discovered the coaching platform and how powerful that was, a group of us said, ""Let's give it a go. ""Let's try using Khan Academy ""as a major part of our curriculum."" And my goodness, it changed the way I teach. For instance, five minutes before I walk into class, I can go to the platform and I can look through my list of students to discover that all but two of them had done the homework, had watched the videos, had cleared the hurdle, if you will, of the exercises that I had given them. So, when I walked in the room, I didn't have to go over homework anymore. That was liberating. So, if there were two students who didn't do the homework, it gave me the opportunity to pull them aside and say, ""Hey, I see you didn't get to it,"" or, ""I see you struggled with it. ""Is there a way that you and I can meet later today? ""It's because I don't want you to get behind in this."" The first 15 minutes of class now all the sudden we're breaking new ground. We're doing harder problems. The kids responded so well to it because I think they had years and years and years of math teachers going over the homework for the first 15 minutes of class. The poor kids must've been bored to death, or, ""Why bother doing the homework because he'll do it on the board anyway?"" That was just totally liberating and gave me an opportunity to really think hard about teaching. Since we started using Khan Academy, the one thing that we can't help but notice is that we're having more kids make it to the end of BC Calculus, and it's clear to me that we're having more girls and more underrepresented kids finish our BC Calculus class than we ever did before. I gotta believe it's our new way about thinking about teaching. And using Khan Academy in the classroom and for homework assignments has gotta be a big part of that.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-limits-continuity
" -  We're asked to subtract negative six X to the fourth minus three X squared Y squared plus Y to the fourth from two X to the fourth minus eight X squared Y squared mins Y to the fourth. And I encourage you to pause this video and give it a try. Alright, let's work through it together. So We're gonna subtract this green polynomial from this magenta one. So we can rewrite this as, we're to actually perform it we could write two X to the fourth minus eight X squared Y squared minus Y to the fourth minus, and I'm gonna write this in parenthesis, give us some space, minus negative six X to the fourth minus three X squared Y squared plus five Y to the fourth. So notice, I'm subtracting this green polynomial in two variables from this magenta polynomial in two variables. Which is exactly what it says to do up here. So what's this going to be? Well I can just rewrite the magenta part. We're gonna have two X to the fourth minus eight X squared Y squared minus Y to the fourth. And then I can distribute this negative sign. So if we say the negative of negative six X to the fourth, that's gonna be positive six X to the fourth. So that's gonna go positive six X to the fourth. And then the negative of negative three X squared Y squared is going to be positive three X squared Y squared. So plus three X squared Y squared. And then last but not least, we have a negative, or we're subtracting positive five Y to the fourth. So that's going to be subtracting five Y to the fourth, or negative five Y to the fourth. And now we can try to simplify. So let's first look at this term right over here. We have two X to the fourths. And what we could look for is another X to the fourth term. And we see it right over here. So we have two X to the fourths and we can add that to six X to the fourths. So what's that going to be? Well if I have two of something, and then I add another six of that something, that's going to be eight X to the fourths, two plus six. Two X to the fourth plus six X to the fourth is going to be eight X to the fourth power. And now we have this X squared Y squared term. We could say we're subtracting eight of them. And over here we're adding three of these X squared Y squared terms. So we could add these coefficients. If we're taking away eight, but we're adding three we could view this as negative eight X squared Y squareds plus three X squared Y squareds. Well what's negative eight plus three? Well that's going to be negative five. Negative five X squareds Y squareds. So that's that term. Let me write that a little bit neater. That's this term right over here, don't forget to include this sign here. This is you're subtracting eight X squared Y squareds, you could do that as negative eight X squared Y squared plus three X squared Y squared. And then last but not least, you're subtracting one Y to the fourth, and then you're subtracting five more Y to the fourths. So what's that going to be? You could view this as negative one Y to the fourth minus five Y to the fourths. Well that's going to be negative one minus five is negative six. Negative six Y to the fourths. And we're done, we have subtracted this from that.",math_engageny-alg-1_alg1-1
" -  In this video, we're going to try to figure out what 0.6 or 6/10 divided by two is. And I'll give you a little bit of a hint. We have 6/10 plotted on the number line right over here. And so one way to think about it is, if I wanted to go from zero to 6/10 in two jumps, how big would each of those jumps have to be? Pause this video and try to figure that out on your own before we work through it together. All right, so as I mentioned, one way to think about it is how can I go from zero to 6/10 in two jumps? Two equal jumps, I should say. Well, if we just eyeball it right over here, I could do one jump like that and then another jump like that. So I did one jump and then two jumps. And so one way to think about it is we've divided 6/10 into two jumps, and each of those jumps are how far? Well, each of those jumps are one, two, 3/10. So this is 3/10 or I could write it like this, 3/10. We have another one, two, 3/10. So this is going to be equal to 3/10. And we've thought about it in other ways. If you have six of something and you divide it by two, you're going to have two groups of three of that something. So if you have 6/10, and you wanna put it into two equal groups, well, each of those groups are going to be 3/10.",math_cc-fifth-grade-math_divide-decimals
" - What I want to do in this video is find the arc length of one petal, I guess we could call it, of the graph of r is equal to four sine of two theta. So I want to find the length of this portion of the curve that is in red right over here. We'll do this in two phases. First of all I want to set up the definite integral for finding that arc length, and then we'll evaluate it. I'll actually use a calculator to evaluate it because it'll be a little bit more straightforward at least for this integral. Let's just start with that. I encourage you to pause the video. Knowing what we know about the formula for arc length, when we have it in polar form, see if you can apply it to figure out this arc length right over here. I'm assuming you've had a go at it, so let's remind ourselves that the arc length is going to be the integral from our starting angle to our ending angle, we'll call it from alpha to beta, of the square root of the derivative of our function. Which respect to theta squared, plus our function squared. Plus our function squared d theta. Let's figure out what r prime of theta and what r of theta actually are. I'll color code it. R prime of theta, we know what r of theta is let me just rewrite it. We know r of theta is equal to four sine of two theta. Our prime of theta is just going to be derivative of two theta with respect to theta is two times four is eight, derivative of sine is cosine, cosine of two theta. If we wanted to write the definite integral for arc length it's going to be equal to the definite integral. What's our starting bound? For the petal that we care about, we're going to start at an angle of zero radians. When we have an angle of zero radians, r is zero, that's this point right over here. We're going to start at zero radians. And we're going to go all the way up to pi over two. When sine of two times pi over two is sine of pi, which is zero, so we'll get back to this point right over here. We're going to go from zero to pi over two, to pi over two radians. It's going to be the square root of, give myself some real estate here, r prime of theta squared is going to be this thing squared. It's going to be 60-- Let me do it in that same blue color, it's going to be 64 cosine squared of two theta, then plus this squared which is going to be 16 sine squared of two theta, then of course we have our d theta. You can attempt to solve this or evaluate this analytically, it's not too straightforward so I'm going to use a calculator. It just gives us a practice with knowing that hey, there are tools out there that can help us do these types of things. I'll go to the definite integral, I'll go to second calculus on my t 85, I picked this choice, which is for the definite integral. Let me express when I'm taking the definite integral of, it's going to be the square root of 64 times cosine of two theta squared. I'm going to use x instead of theta just because it's an easier variable to use on my calculator. Cosine of two-- Actually let me make sure my parenthesis are good. Cosine of two x, alright I'll close that. Now I want to square that. I did that first part. Plus 16 times plus 16 times 16 times sine of two x. Close that, close that. Squared. I'm not sure if the calculator knows to interpret that as multiplication, so let me insert a times right over here. 64 times cosine of two x, that thing squared. Plus 16 times sine of two x, that thing squared. Let me go to the end. Let me close my radical, so that's going to close that right over there, that closes what I'm taking the square root of. Then comma, the variable that I'm integrating with respect to is x, in this case. Everywhere I saw theta here I'm just replacing with an x there. I want to do it from, instead of theta equals zero to theta equals pi over two, we'll say x is equal to zero to x is equal to pi over two. Hopefully I have not made a mistake when I've typed this in, And I get... It's chugging on a little bit. And we get... Will it actually come up? Oh finally! If we were to round it to the nearest thousandth it'll be nine point six eight eight. Approximately nine point six eight eight. Let's just see, does that make intuitive sense? It goes as far as four away, so if you just went out to four and then back down that would be about eight. Of course we have actually gone out some, so it actually makes intuitive sense that this arc length would be nine point six eight eight. Hopefully you enjoyed that.",math_integral-calculus_ic-adv-funcs
" Find the absolute value of x when x is equal to 5, x is equal to negative 10, and x is equal to negative 12. So the absolute value, the way of writing it is almost more complicated than what it really is. The absolute value is really just the distance of x from 0. So let me just draw a fast number line over here. So let's just put 0 right over here, since we're thinking about the distance from 0. So let's just think about the absolute value. Let's think about the absolute value of x when x is equal to 5. So that's equivalent to the absolute value of 5. We just substituted 5 for x. The absolute value of 5 is the distance of 5 from the 0. So you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5 is exactly 5 to the right of 0. So the absolute value of 5 is just 5. Now I think you already get to see this is a pretty straightforward concept. Now let's do something a little more interesting, the absolute value of x when x is equal to negative 10. So let's just put negative 10 in for x. This is the distance that negative 10 is from 0. And so let's just go negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4, negative 5, negative 6, negative 7, negative 8, negative 9, negative 10. I should extend the number line more. So this right here is negative 10. So how far is it away from 0? Well, it's 10 to the left of 0. So you put a 10 here. And so in general, absolute value will always be a positive quantity. And when we're rethinking about just absolute values of just numbers, it's just going to be, really, the positive version of that number. Let's do one more. Well, they tell us to do one more, the absolute value of x when x is equal to negative 12. So we have the absolute value of negative 12. We don't even to look at the number line. It's just going to be the positive version of negative 12. It's just going to be equal to 12. And this is just saying that negative 12 is 12 away from 0. And we could draw it over here. This is negative 11. Negative 12 is right over here. It is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 away from 0.",math_arithmetic_arith-review-negative-numbers
" -  We're gonna do in this video is try to evaluate the definite integral from zero to pi of x cosine of x dx. Like always, pause this video and see if you can evaluate it yourself. Well when you immediately look at this, it's not obvious how you just straight up take the anti-derivative here and then evaluate that at pi and then subtract from that and evaluate it at zero, so we're probably going to have to use a slightly more sophisticated technique. And in general, if you see a product of functions right over here, and if one of these functions is fairly straightforward to take the anti-derivative of without making it more complicated like cosine of x, and another of the functions like x if you were to take its derivative, it gets simpler. In this case, it would just become one. It's a pretty good sign that we should be using integration by parts. So let's just remind ourselves about integration by parts. So integration by parts, I'll do it right over here, if I have the integral and I'll just write this as an indefinite integral but here we wanna take the indefinite integral and then evaluate it at pi and evaluate it at zero, so if I have f of x times g prime of x, dx, this is going to be equal to, and in other videos we prove this, it really just comes straight out of the product rule that you learned in differential calculus, this is gonna be equal to f of x times g of x minus, you then swap these around, minus f prime of x, g of x, dx. And just to reiterate what I said before, you wanna find an f of x that when I take its derivative, it simplifies it, so simplify, and you wanna find a g prime of x that when I take its anti-derivative, so when I take its anti-derivative, it doesn't get more complicated. So not more complicated. Because if the f of x gets simplified when I take its derivative, and the g prime of x does not get more complicated when I take its anti-derivative, then this expression will maybe be easier to find the anti-derivative of. So let's do that over here. Between x and cosine of x, which one gets more simple when I take its derivative? Well the derivative of x is just one, so I'm gonna make that my f of x, so I could write that over here, so my f of x, I will say is x, in which case, f prime of x, f prime of x, is going to be equal to one, and then what would my g prime of x be? Well my g prime of x, cosine of x if I take its anti-derivative, it doesn't get more complicated. The anti-derivative of cosine of x is sine of x. So let me make that my g prime of x. So g prime of x is equal to cosine of x in which case g of x, the anti-derivative of cosine of x, well it's just sine of x or another way to think about it, the derivative of sine of x is cosine of x. Now you could think about plus C's and all of that but remember, this is gonna be a definite integral so all of those arbitrary constants are going to get canceled out. So now let's think through this. Let's just apply the integration by parts here. In this particular case, all of this is going to be equal to, so I'm saying that is equal to this, I'm gonna skip down here, it's going to be equal to f of x times g of x. So that is f of x is x, g of x is sine of x, f of x times g of x, minus the integral of f prime of x, f prime of x is just one, we could write it like that, one times g of x, g of x is sine of x, so we could write it like this, but one times sine of x, well we could just rewrite that as sine of x, it'll make it a little bit simpler, sine of x, dx, and then remember, this is a definite integral, so we are going to want to evaluate this whole thing at pi and at zero, and then take the difference between the two. But what is the indefinite integral of sine of x dx? Well, or to say the anti-derivative of it, we know that the derivative of cosine is negative sine of x, and so in fact what we want, we could bring this negative sine into the integral, so we could say plus the integral of negative sine of x, now this clearly the anti-derivative here is cosine of x, so this thing is going to be cosine of x, and now we just have to evaluate it at the end points. So let's first evaluate this whole thing at pi. So this is going to be equal to pi sine of pi, pi sine of pi, plus cosine of pi, and then from that I'm going to subtract this whole thing evaluated at zero, so let me do zero in a different color, at zero, so it's going to be zero times sine of zero plus cosine of zero, so let's see, sine of pi is just zero so this is just going to cancel out. Cosine of pi, that is negative one, and then this is zero, and then cosine of zero, that is one, so you have negative one minus one, so this all gets us to negative two, and we are done. Using integration by parts, we were able to evaluate this definite integral.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-integration-new
" -  Joey used 0.432 pounds of cheese to make mac-and-cheese for dinner, and we could also call this 432/1,000 pounds of cheese to make mac-and-cheese for dinner. Round the amount of cheese to the nearest tenth. So the amount of cheese once again is 0.432 pounds and just remember the places here. This is 4/10, so that's the tenths place. This is the hundredths place, and that's an S there, so tenths, hundredths, and this right over here is thousandths, thousandths place. So we wanna round to the nearest tenth. So we're gonna round to the nearest tenth. We go one place to the right. If it's five or larger, we round up. This would become a five. If it's less than five, well, if it's less than five, which is the case here, we're gonna round down to just 4/10 even. So because three is less than five, we are going to round down, and we're going to get 0.400, or we could write that as 0.4, or we could write that as 4/10 of a pound. Let's do another one. Eliza's pet snail traveled 2.197 meters in one day. Round the distance to the nearest hundredth. So pause this video and see if you can do that. Round the distance to the nearest hundredth. So it's 2.197. This is the hundredths place right over here, and so if we're gonna round to the nearest hundredth, we're gonna go one place to the right. If this one place to the right is five or greater, we're gonna round up, and seven is five or greater, so we are going to round up . Now this is interesting 'cause if you round a nine up, you get to 10, but you can't put a whole 10 right over here. So one way to think about it is you have a 19 here, and so if you round up, you're gonna go to a 20, or another way to think about it. If you round the nine up, you're gonna go to the next tenth. So this is going to be 2 point, you could view this as 19/100 or 19/100 and 7/1,000, and so now we're gonna round up to 20/100, so 2.20. We're rounding to the nearest hundredth, which you could write as 2.2, but to make it clear that you're rounding to the nearest hundredth, you're gonna write 2.20, and later in your life, this actually might matter to actually show what you're rounding to. Let's do another example here. Cassandra spends 6.75 hours each day at school. Round the amount of time to the nearest hour. Alright, so 6.75, so you might be a little confused, and actually, I encourage you to pause the video again and try to solve it on your own. So you might be a little confused 'cause they're not saying round it to the nearest tenth or hundredth or one or 10 or 100. They're saying to the nearest hour, but in this case, the hour is the ones place. So if we're gonna round to the nearest hour, this is another way of saying round to the nearest one. So we're gonna round to the nearest one. We go one place to the right. We go to look at the tenths place. If it's five or larger, we round up. Well, seven is five or larger, so we round up to the next hour, which is going to be seven, so seven hours. If this was 6.49999, once again, if we're rounding to the nearest hour, we go one place to the right. It doesn't matter that we have all these nines here. We'd say, hey, look, four is less than five. Therefore, we should round down, round down, and you would round down to the next hour. Well, the next hour that's below 6.499999, nine, nine, nine, nine, is six hours, but in this case, we had a seven in the tenths place, which is definitely greater than or equal to five, and so we'd round up to the next hour, which is seven hours.",math_in-in-class-5th-math-cbse_imp-place-value-and-decimals
" Let's say we have the indefinite integral of the square root of 6x minus x squared minus 5. And obviously this is not some simple integral. I don't have just, you know, this expression and its derivative lying around, so u-substitution won't work. And so you can guess from just the title of this video that we're going to have to do something fancier. And we'll probably have to do some type of trig substitution. But this immediately doesn't look kind of amenable to trig substitution. I like to do trig substitution when I see kind of a 1 minus x squared under a radical sign, or maybe an x squared minus 1 under a radical sign, or maybe a x squared plus 1. These are the type of things that get my brain thinking in terms of trig substitution. but that doesn't quite look like that just yet. I have a radical sign. I have some x squared, but it doesn't look like this form. So let's if we can get it to be in this form. Let me delete these guys right there real fast. So let's see if we can maybe complete the square down here. So let's see. If this is equal to, let me rewrite this. And if this completing the square doesn't look familiar to you, I have a whole bunch of videos on that. Let me rewrite this as equal to minus 5 minus-- I need more space up here-- minus 5 minus x squared. Now there's a plus 6x, but I have a minus out here. So minus 6 x, right? A minus and a minus will becomes plus 6x. And then, I want to make this into a perfect square. So what number when I add it to itself will be minus 6? Well, it's minus 3 and minus 3 squared. So you take half of this number, you get minus 3, and you square it. Then you put a 9 there. Now, I can't just arbitrarily add nines. Or actually, I didn't add a 9 here. What did I do? I subtracted a 9. Because I threw a 9 there, but it's really a minus 9, because of this minus sign out there. So in order to make this neutral to my 9 that I just threw in there, this is a minus 9. I have to add a 9. So let me add a 9. So plus 9, right there. If this doesn't make complete sense, what I just did, and obviously you have the dx right there, multiply this out. You get minus x squared plus 6x, which are these two terms right there, minus 9, and then you'll have this plus 9, and these two will cancel out, and you'll just get exactly back to what we had before. Because I want you to realize, I didn't change the equation. This is a minus 9 because of this. So I added a 9, so I really added 0 to it. But what this does, it gets it into a form that I like. Obviously this, right here, just becomes a 4, and then this term right here becomes, what? That is x minus 3 squared. x minus 3 squared. So my indefinite integral now becomes the integral, I'm just doing a little bit of algebra, the integral of the square root of 4 minus x minus 3 squared dx. Now this is starting to look like a form that I like, but I like to have a 1 here. So let's factor a 4 out. So this is equal to, I'll switch colors, that's equal to the integral of the radical, and we'll have the 4, times 1 minus x minus 3 squared over 4. I just took a 4 out of both of these terms. If I multiply this out, I'll just get back to that, right there, dx. And now this is starting to look like a form that I like. Let me simplify it even more. So this is equal to the integral, if I take the 4 out, it becomes 2 times the square root of 1 minus, and I can rewrite this as x minus 3, let me write this way. 1 minus x minus 3 over 2 squared dx. And where did I get that 2 from? Well, if I just square both of these, I get x minus 3 squared over 2 squared. Which is x minus 3 over 4. So I have done no calculus so far. I just algebraically rewrote this indefinite integral as this indefinite integral. They are equivalent. But this, all of a sudden, looks like a form that I recognize. I showed you in the last video that cosine squared of theta is just equal to 1 minus sine squared of theta. You could actually do it the other way. You could do sine squared is equal to 1 minus cosine squared. No difference. But they both will work out. But this looks an awful lot like this. In fact, it would look exactly like this if I say that that is equal to sine squared of theta. So let me make that substitution. Let me write that x minus 3 over 2 squared is equal to sine squared of theta. Now, if we take the square root of both sides of that equation, I get x minus 3 over 2 is equal to sine of theta. Now we're eventually, you know where this is going to go. We're eventually going to have to substitute back for theta. So let's solve for theta in terms of x. So theta in terms of x, we could just say, just take the arc sine of both sides of this. You get theta is equal to, right, the arc sine of the sine is just theta. Theta is equal to the arc sine of x minus 3 over 2. Fair enough. Now, to actually do the substitution, though, we're going to have figure out what dx is, we're going to have to solve for x in terms of theta. So let me do that. So we get, if we multiply both sides of the equation by 2, we get x minus 3 is equal to 2 times the sine of theta, or that x is equal to 2 sine of theta plus 3. Now, if we take the derivative of both sides with respect to theta, we get dx d theta, is equal to 2 cosine of theta, derivative of this is just 0. Or we can multiply both sides by d theta, and we get dx is equal to 2 cosine of theta d theta. And we're ready to substitute back into our original indefinite integral. So this thing will now be rewritten as the integral of 2 times the radical, if I can get some space, of 1 minus, I'm replacing this with sine squared of theta. And all that times dx. Well, I just said that dx is equal to this, right here. So dx is equal to 2 cosine of theta d theta. What does this simplify to? This action right here, this is just cosine squared of theta. And we're going to take the square root of cosine squared of theta. So this, the square root of cosine squared of data, this whole term right here, right? That becomes the square root of cosine squared of theta, which is just the same thing as cosine of theta. So our integral becomes, so our integral is equal to, 2 times the square root of cosine squared of theta, so that's just 2 times cosine of theta, times 2 times cosine of theta. That's that one, right there. This is this, and all of this radical sine, that's this, right there. 1 minus sine squared was cosine squared, take the radical, you get cosine squared. And then everything times d theta. Now this is obviously equal to 4 times cosine squared of theta d theta. Which, by itself, is still not an easy integral to solve. I don't know, you know, I can't do U-substitution or anything like that, there. So what do we do? Well, we resort to our good old trig identities. Now, I don't know if you have this one memorized, although it tends to be in the inside cover of most calculus books, or inside cover of most trig books. But cosine squared of theta can be rewritten as 1/2 times 1 plus cosine of 2 theta. And I've proven this in multiple videos. So let's just make this substitution. Let me just replace this thing with that thing. So this integral becomes, it equals, 4 times cosine squared of theta, but cosine squared of theta is this. 4 times 1/2 times 1 plus cosine of 2 theta d theta. Now, this looks easier to deal with. So what is it? 4 times 1/2, that's 2. So my integral becomes the integral of 2 times 1, so it's 2, plus 2 times 2 cosine of 2 theta, all of that d theta. Now, this antiderivative is pretty straightforward. What is this, right here? This is the derivative with respect of theta of sine of 2 theta, right? This whole thing. What's the derivative sine of 2 theta? Take the derivative of the inside, that's 2, times the derivative of the outside, cosine of 2 theta. And this, of course, is the derivative of 2 theta. So this is equal to, the antiderivative of 2 with respect to theta, is just 2 theta, plus the antiderivative of this, which is just sine of 2 theta, and then we have a plus c. And of course, we can't forget that we defined theta, our original antiderivative was in terms of x. So we can't just leave it in terms of theta. 1We're going to have to do a back substitution. 1So let's just remember, theta was equal to arc 1sine of x minus 3 over 2. 1Let me write that on the side here. 1Now, if I immediately substitute this theta straight 1into this, I'm going to get a sine of 2 times arc sine of x 1minus 3 over 2, which would be correct. 1And I would have a 2 times arc sine of x minus 3 over 2. 1That would all be fine, and we would be done. 1But that's not satisfying. 1It's not a nice clean answer. 1So let's see if we can simplify this, so it's only in 1terms of sine of theta. 1So when you take the sine of the arc sine, then it just 1simplifies to x minus 3 over 2. 1Let me make that clear. 1So if I can write all of this in terms of sines of theta, 1because the sine of theta is equal to the sine of the arc 1sine of x minus 3 over 2. 1Which is just equal to x minus 3 over 2. 1So if I can write this in terms of sines of theta, then I can 1just make this substitution. 1Sine of theta equals that, and everything 1simplifies a good bit. 1So let's see if we can do that. 1Well, you may or may not know the other identity, and I've 1proven this as well, that sine of 2 theta, that's the same 1thing as sine of theta plus theta, which is equal to sine 1of theta cosine of theta plus, the thetas get swapped around, 1sine of theta plus cosine of theta, which is equal to, this 1is just the same thing written twice, 2 sine of theta 1cosine of theta. 1Some people have this memorized ahead of time, and if you have 1to take an exam on trig substitution, it doesn't hurt 1to have this memorized ahead of time. 1But let's rewrite this like this. 1So our indefinite integral in terms of theta, or our 1antiderivative, became 2 theta, plus, instead of sine of 2 1theta, we could write, 2 sine of theta cosine of theta, and 1of course we have a plus c. 1Now, I want to write everything in terms of sines of theta, but 1I have a cosine if theta there. 1So what can we do? 1Well, we know we know that cosine squared of theta is 1equal to 1 minus sine squared of theta, or that cosine of 1theta is equal to the square root of 1 minus sine 1squared of theta. 1Which seems like we're adding complexity to it, but the neat 1thing is, it's in terms of sine of theta. 1So let's do that. 1Let's make the substitution. 1So our antiderivative, this is the same thing as 2 data plus 2 1sine of theta times cosine of theta, which is equal to this, 1times the square root of 1 minus sine squared of theta, 1and all of that plus c. 1Now we're in the home stretch. 1This problem was probably harder than you thought 1it was going to be. 1We know that sine theta is equal to x minus 3 over 2. 1So let's make that reverse substitution. 1So we have 2 times theta. 1This first term is just 2 times theta, right there. 1So that's 2 times, we can't escape the arc sine. 1If we just have a theta, we have to say that theta is 1equal to arc sine of x minus 3 over 2. 1And then we have plus, let me switch colors, 1plus 2 sine of theta. 1Well, that's plus 2 times sine of theta is x minus 3 over 2. 1So 2 times x minus 3 over 2, and then all of that times 1the square root of 1 minus sine of theta squared. 1What's sine of theta? 1It's x minus 3 over 2 squared. 1And of course we have a plus c. 1Let's see if we can simplify this even more, now that 1we're at the home stretch. 1So this is equal to 2 arc sine of x minus 3 over 2, plus these 1two terms, this 2 and this 2 cancel out, plus x minus 3, 1times the square root of, what happens if we multiply 1everything here by, let's see, if we take a, so this is equal 1to 1 minus x minus 3 over 4. x minus 3 squared over 4. 1This simplification, I should write that in quotes, is taking 1me longer than I thought. 1But let's see if we can simplify this even more. 1If we multiply, let me just focus on this term right here, 1if we multiply the outside, or say, let's multiply 1and divide this by 2. 1So I'll write this as-- so let's just multiply 1this times 2 over 2. 1You might say, Sal, why are you doing that? 1Because I can rewrite this, let me write my whole thing here. 1So I have 2 arc sine of x minus 3 over 2, and then 1I have, I could take this denominator 2 right here. 1So I say, plus x minus 3 over 2. 1That 2 is that 2 right there. 1And then I could write this 2 right here as 1a square root of 4. 1Times the square root of 4, times the square 1root of all of this. 11 minus x minus 3 squared over 4. 1I think you see where I'm going. 1I'm kind of reversing everything that I did at the 1beginning of this problem. 1And maybe I'm getting a little fixated on making this as 1simple as possible, but I'm so close, so let me finish. 1So I get 2 times the arc sine of x minus 3 over 2, which I'm 1tired of writing, plus x minus 3 over 2, and if we bring this 14 in, right, the square root of 4 times the square root of that 1is equal to the square root of 4 times these things. 1So it's 4 minus x minus 3 squared, all of 1that that plus c. 1And we're at the home stretch. 1This is equal to 2 times the arc sine of x minus 3 over 2 1plus x minus 3 over 2 times the radical of 4 minus, let's 1expand this, x squared minus 6x plus 9. 1And then this expression right here simplifies to minus minus, 1it's 6x minus x squared, and then you have a 4 1minus 9 minus 5. 1Which is our original antiderivative. 1So finally, we're at the very end. 1We get the antiderivative is 2 arc sine of x minus 3 over 2 1plus x minus 3 over 2 times, time the radical of 6x 1minus x squared minus 5. 1That right there is the antiderivative of what this 1thing that we had at the very top of my little chalkboard, 1which is right there. 1So that is equal to the antiderivative of the 1square root of 6x minus x squared minus 5 dx. 1And I can imagine that you're probably as tired as I am. 1My hand actually hurts. 1But hopefully you find that to be vaguely satisfying. 1Sometimes I get complaints that I only do easy problems. 1Well, this was quite a hairy and not-so-easy problem.",math_old-integral-calculus_integration-techniques
" -  So let's say S is the value that this infinite series converges to. We're going to assume that this series actually converges. And the definition of the series, each term is going to be a function of N. We're going to assume that this is the same type of series that we looked at when we looked at the integral test, or namely that this function is a continuous positive decreasing function over the interval that we care about. So it is continuous, it is positive, and it is decreasing. This isn't saying continuous plus decreasing. Let me just write it that way. Continuous positive and it is decreasing. So it could be a function that looks something like this. Now, my goal of this video is to see if we can estimate a range around S. So this is going to be very useful, because we've seen some infinite series where we are able to figure out what exactly does it converge to. But you could imagine there are many, many more where we're not going to be able to figure out exactly what it converges to. And instead we're going to have to do it using a computer or by hand. And in those cases, it's good to know how good our estimate is. And we also want as good of an estimate as possible with as little computation as possible. So let's think about how we can do that. Well, the way to tackle it, you could imagine, is let's split this up, this infinite sum, let's split it up into the sum of a finite sum. So let's say the first k terms. So n equals one to k of f of n. So this is very computable. If k is low enough and if f a simple enough function, you could probably do this by hand. But you could definitely do this with a computer. And then it's going to be that plus an infinite. Plus another infinite series. But now you're going to pick up at k plus one, the k plus one term. And you're going to go to infinity of f of n. So if we could put some bounds on this, then that'll allow us to put some bounds on this right over here. Because this is just the sum of the partial sum of the partial sum of the first k terms and the remainder that we get after to get us to the actual value. So you could see kind of what's left over after we take that partial sum. And this is easier to write for me than this right over here. So they key is, can we come up with some bounds for this? And to do that I'm going to go to this graph and use some of the same arguments we used, or the same conceptual ideas we used, for the integration test. There's two ways to conceptualize what the sum represents relative to this graph. As we'll see, it can represent an over estimate of the area between sum, x value, and infinity. And it could represent the underestimate of a different region. So let's look at that. So let's first think about the underestimate. Let's think about the underestimate. So if this right over here, let's say that this right over here is k. Actually, let me do it in a color that's... Let me do it in that yellow color. So let's say that this right over here is k. This is k plus one. Let's do this is k plus two. K plus 2, k plus 3, on and on and on. So one way to conceptualize this sum right over here is it could be the sum of the following rectangles. So the first term is this area, the area of this first rectangle. Because this area's height, or this rectangle's height, is f of k plus one. And its width is one, so f of k plus one times one. Its area is just going to be f of k plus one, which is exactly this first term right over here, where n is k plus one. And then the second term, by that same argument, could represent the area of this rectangle. The third term could represent the area of the rectangle. And we could just keep going on and on and on. So what are the sums of these areas of these rectangles? What are the sums of these terms representing? Well, you could view it as an estimate. You could view it as an estimate of the area under the curve between x equals k and x equals infinity. But it's going to be an underestimate. Notice these are all completely contained in that area. So one way to think about it is that our R sub k is less than or equal to its underestimate for the area between x equals k and infinity of f of x dx. So that essentially puts an upper bound on us. And this is already interesting, because now we can already say if S -- so we know that S is equal to this. Now if this is less than this thing right over here, we can say that S is going to be less than or equal to our partial sum plus this thing. Plus the improper integral from k to infinity of f of x dx. Notice if this is equal to this and now since this is less than this, this must be less than what we have on the right hand side. So just like that, if we're able to compute these two things and we are often able to compute these two things, we're able to put an upper bound on our actual sum. Now what about placing a lower bound on it? Well, we could conceptualize the same sum, the same R sub k. Instead we can conceptualize it this way, where the first term here represents not this rectangle, but it represents this rectangle. Notice it has the same height, but it's just shifted over one to the right. The second term represents this rectangle. This third term represents this rectangle. Why does that make sense? Well, the area of this first rectangle, this is going to be its height, which is f of k plus one times its width, which is just one, so it's going to be f of k plus one. So the area here is the first term, the area here is the second term, area here is the third term, the area here is the fourth term. One way to think about it, we just shifted all of those yellow rectangles one to the right. But now this is approximating a different region. This is approximating the area under the curve not from k to infinity, but from k plus one to infinity. And instead of being an underestimate, it's an overestimate. Now the curve is contained within the rectangles. So we could say that R sub k in this context, when we conceptualize it this way, is going to be greater than or equal to the improper integral not from k, but from k plus one to infinity f of x dx. And what does that allow us to do? Well, this places a lower bound on this, which will also place a lower bound on this. If this is greater than that, then this is going to be greater than this replaced with the improper integral. So we can write that. So S is going to be greater than or equal to S sub k plus the improper integral from k plus one to infinity f of x dx. Now, you might be saying, ""Hey, Sal, this looks all ""crazy, you have all this abstract notation here, you've ""introduced an integral sign, this seems really daunting."" But as we'll see in the next few videos, these are actually sometimes fairly straightforward to compute. This can be very straightforward to compute if our k is not too large. If it's even large, a computer can do it. And then these we can actually often compute sometimes numerically, but even more frequently, and that kind of defeats the purpose, but we can also compute them using our analytic tools, using, I guess you could say, the power of calculus. And so what this allows us to do is put a pretty neat band around what our actual value that we converge to is. And as we'll see, the higher our k, the better an estimate we get and the tighter arrange of our confidence for that estimate. And another way to write these two inequalities is to write a compound inequality that S is going to be less than or equal to this business. So copy and paste. And S is going to be greater than or equal to this business. So we could say this business is going to be less than or equal to S. So let me just copy and paste that. So copy and paste. Oops, that's not what I wanted to do. So copy and paste. Then we could write it just like that. And so the next series of videos will actually apply this and we'll see that it's pretty straightforward. It looks a little daunting right now.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-series
" -  The function m is given in three equivalent forms. Which form most quickly reveals the y-intercept? So let's just remind ourselves. If I have a function, the graph y is equal to m of x. And these are all equivalent forms, they tell us that. The function m is given in three equivalent forms. I should be able to algebraically manipulate anyone of these to get any of the other ones. And so, if I wanted to graph y is equal to m of x, and let's say it looks something like this. I actually know it's a downward opening parabola, because I can look at this form right over here and say, ""Hey look, the coefficient ""on the second degree term here is a negative."" So it's going to be a downward opening parabola. That's a messy drawing of it. And so if we're talking about the y intercept, we're saying, ""Hey where does it intersect the y-axis?"" So what is the y value when x is equal to zero? So it boils down to how quickly can we evaluate m of zero? What is m of x, when x is equal to zero? So how quickly can you evaluate m of zero? Well in this top one, I can substitute zero for x and so it'll be negative two times negative three times negative nine. So it's not too hard to figure out, but there's going to be some calculation in my head. Similarly in the second choice, for x equals zero, I then get negative six-squared, which is positive 36 times negative two, which is negative 72, and then I have to add that to positive 18. I can do that, but it's a little bit of computation. But here for this last one, and this is known as standard form, if I say x equals zero that term disappears, that term disappears and I'm just left with m of zero is equal to negative 54. So standard form, this is standard form right over here, was by far the easiest. So we know the y-intercept is zero comma negative 54. Now one rule of caution. Sometimes you might look at what is called, vertex form. And as we'll see this is the easiest one where it is to identify the vertex. But when you see this little plus 18 hanging out, it looks a lot like this negative 54 that was hanging out. And you say, ""Hey, when x equals zero, ""maybe I can just cross that out ""the same way that I cross these terms out."" And be very, very careful there, because if x equals zero, this whole thing does not equal zero. When x is equal to zero, as I just said, you have negative six-squared, which is 36 times negative two. This is equal to negative 72. So m of zero is definitely not 18. So be very, very careful. But we can see that the best choice is this one, standard form, not vertex form or factored form. Factored form, as you can imagine, is very good for figuring out the zeros. Let's do another example. And actually this is the same m of x, but we're going to ask something else. So it's given in those same three forms. Which form most quickly reveals the vertex? Well I just called this vertex form before, but what's valuable about the vertex form is you can really say, ""Okay, this is going to be, ""this is going to achieve its vertex ""when this thing over here is equal to zero."" How do I know that? Well, once you get used to vertex form, it'll just become a bit of second nature. But if this is a downward-opening parabola, the vertex is when you hit that maximum point. And as you can see here, x minus six-squared is always going to be non-negative. You multiply that times the negative two, it's always going to be non-positive. It's either going to be zero or a negative value, so this is always going to take away from this 18. And so if you want to find the vertex, the maximum point here, it would be the x value that makes this thing equal to zero. Because for any other x value, this thing is going to be negative, it's going to take away from that 18. And so you can see by inspection, well what x value will make this equal to zero? Well if x is equal to six, six minus six is equal to zero, zero-squared is zero, times negative two is zero. And so m of six is equal to 18. So this lets us know very quickly that the vertex is going to happen at x is equal to six and then the y value there or the m of six is going to be equal to 18. You can do it with these other ones. The hardest one would be standard form. Standard form you could complete the square or do some other techniques or you could try to get into factored form. Factored form you can find the zeros and then you'd know that the x-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the x-coordinate of our two x-intercepts and then you could figure out the y value there. But this one is definitely the easiest. The vertex form and what is the vertex? Well it's going to happen at the point six comma 18. Let's do one last example. So this is a different function. The function f is given in three equivalent forms, which form most quickly reveals the zeros or roots of the function? So once again, when we're talking about zeros or roots, if we have, let's say that's the x axis and if you have a parabola that looks like that, the roots are, or the zeros are the x values that make that function equal to zero. Or they're the x values of the x-intercepts, you could say. And so what x values make or which one is easy to figure out when this function is equal to zero? Which of these forms, because they're all equivalent. You can expand out these first two and you should get this last one in standard form. Which one is easy to identify the zeros? Well in factored form, I could just say, ""Well, what makes either this thing zero ""or that thing zero?"" Because an x that makes this first one zero or the second one zero is going to make this whole expression zero. So you can quickly say, ""Well if x is equal to negative one, ""this is going to be zero. ""Or if x is equal to negative 11, ""this is going to be zero."" So this is a very fast way to find out the zeros. This one here, a lot harder. You would have to solve three times x plus six-squared minus 75 is equal to zero. Do some algebraic manipulation and you would eventually get to these answers. So I would rule the vertex form right over here. And this form, standard form, the first step I would do, is try to get it into factored form. And then from factored form, I would find the zeros. So once again, this is definitely more work than if you already have it in factored form. So factored form is definitely what you want when you're trying to find the zeros. And here it says write one of the zeros, I could write x equals negative one or I could have written x equals negative 11.",math_math2_quad-2
" So right over here we have the graph of the function f. And we're assuming that f is a function of t, our horizontal axis. Here's the t-axis. So that is f of t, lowercase f of t. And now let's just, let's define another function. Let's call it capital F of, and it's not going to be a function of t. It's going to be a function of x. So capital F of x is equal to. We're gonna definite it as the definite integral between t is equal to negative 5 and t is equal to x. Actually let me make those x's in the same color so they really stand out. So f of x is equal to the definite integral between t is equal to negative 5 and t is equal to x of f of t, f of t dt. And if I had my druthers I'd probably wouldn't use capital f and lower case f, I would use like a g or capital G just so that when I say F, you don't get confused. Well I'm gonna try my best to say lower-case F of t, capital F of x. So this is how we're gonna define the function capital F of x. Definite integral between t is equal to negative 5, and x of f of t, dt. Now given this definition. What I wanna think about is at what x values does capital F of x, does capital F of x equal 0? So we'll write that down. At what x values does, this is, is this, I guess you could say, this equation, at what x values is this equation true? And I encourage you to pause this video right now and try to think about it on your own. And then we can work through it together. So I'm assuming you've had a go at it, so let's just think about what this, what this function capital F of x is really talking about. Well it's the one way to think about it is it's the area below, between negative 5, between t equals negative 5 and t equals x, that is below the function f of t and above the t axis. And if the areas is the other way around, if it's below the t axis and above the function, it's gonna be negative area. So we're looking at t equals negative 5, which is this, you could say this boundary right over here. That is t is equal to negative 5. And if you put, pick an x value, let's just say x were negative 2, so if that is your x value right over here, capital F would describe, would describe this area, this area it would be a negative area because here the function is below the t axis. So, for example capital F of negative 2 would be negative. Now, what x values makes this a 0? So one might jump out at you. Well, if we just, if we made, if we put x, if we put x right at negative 5. Right at negative 5. Then there's no width, width here. There's not going to be any area. So f of, f of negative 5. F of negative 5, F of negative capital F of negative 5, I should be clear here. Capital F of negative 5, which is equal to the definite integral between t is equal to negative 5 and t is equal to negative 5, of f of t dt. F of t dt. Well you have the, you have the, you, you have the same boundaries here. So this is going to be 0, once again this area you have no width to this area. So this is going to be equal to 0. So, we can list x equals negative 5 as being one of the points. One of the x values that makes capital F of x equal 0. But let's see if we can find more of them. Let's see if we were to go, let me erase this right over here. So, this was. We're starting at t equals negative 5. Now as x gets larger and larger and larger, when x is equal to negative 3, our area. So, let's see this area right over here, this area right over here is going to be, so that is, I see that we have, it's 2, we're going from negative 5 to negative 3. So the distance right over here is two. This height, right over here, is 4. So, this area, right over here, is 2 times 4 times 1/2, which is going to be 4. And, since it's above the function and below the t-axis, we'll write this as a negative, we'll write that as a negative 4. And now, so let's see, so we're starting when x is equal to 5. Uf, capital F of x is equal to 0, that is you get further and further out, you're getting more and more negative values, that's more and more negative values. But I just picked out this point right over here because this seems like a point of transition of the function, and then we have. This region, which is just going to add more negative area to capital F of x as x gets larger and larger and larger. And this looks like a really, a quarter circle. This is, it has a quarter circle of radius 4, and now we have another quarter circle of radius 4 until we get to x equals 5. And this is actually going to be positive area. Because here our function is above the t axis. So when we've gotten this far, so all, the way I'm thinking about it, my x is, my x, when capital F of x equal negative 5 is, is 0. And now our area, as x becomes larger and larger, and larger, our area becomes negative, negative, negative, negative. Now it becomes less negative, because we're starting to add, we're starting to add. So, for example, if x is equal to 2, if x is equal to 2, we would be looking at this positive. But we still have all this huge negative area to overcome. So we're still in negative territory. But the more positive we add, we're gonna become less negative. And you go all the way to x equals positive 5 and this positive area, this quarter circle right over here of positive area, is going to exactly offset this quarter circle of negative area. You don't even have to think about what that area is, although you can obviously figure it out with pi R squared and whatever else. And so now we just have to keep adding more positive area to offset this negative 4. So how do we do that? Well the height here, the height right over here is 4, the height right over here is 4 so if we, if we can add our rectangle that is one wide and 4 high. That's positive area of 4, which this has right over here. So this is plus 4. Is going to offset this negative 4. So we go all the way to x is equal to 6. When x is equal to 6, capital F of x is going to be equal to 0. Let's write that down. So capital F. Capital f of, capital f of positive 6, of positive 6, which is going to be equal to the definite integral between negative 5 and positive 6. Positive 6 of f of t. F of t, dt, well we can break this up. We already went through it, I'm just gonna, going to make sure that we really understood what was going on. This is equal to, and I'll just to it all in one color now. This is equal to, actually I'll do it in these colors that I did here. This is equal to the integral. The integral between negative 5 and negative 3 of f of t, dt, plus the integral, plus the integral between negative 3 and 1 of f of t dt. Plus the integral between 1 and 5 of f of t, dt. That describes this right over here. And then finally, plus, plus the definite integral between 5 and 6 of f of t, dt. f of t, dt. And, this describes this negative area. This describes this positive area. These two net out to be 0. And then this area we already figured out, is. Or this definite integral I should say is negative 4. This is negative 4 and this one right over here is positive 4 and so they net out and this of course is equal to 0 which we wanted to figure out. Once again how did I do that? Well I said okay clearly when x is equal to negative 5 you have no area and then i just kept increasing, kept increasing xs to larger and larger values, I could have gone actually the other way. And, I would have had just more and more positive values there would have been nothing to offset it to get us back to 0. But, as we increased x above negative 5, the capital Fof x; the area, is more and more and more negative, but then it becomes, then we start adding positive value to it to offset the negative. And, we fully offset the negative at x is equal to 6.",math_old-integral-calculus_fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-ic
" What I want to do in this video is kind of introduce you to the idea of, one, how carbon-14 comes about, and how it gets into all living things. And then either later in this video or in future videos we'll talk about how it's actually used to date things, how we use it actually figure out that that bone is 12,000 years old, or that person died 18,000 years ago, whatever it might be. So let me draw the Earth. So let me just draw the surface of the Earth like that. It's just a little section of the surface of the Earth. And then we have the atmosphere of the Earth. I'll draw that in yellow. So then you have the Earth's atmosphere right over here. Let me write that down, atmosphere. And 78%, the most abundant element in our atmosphere is nitrogen. It is 78% nitrogen. And I'll write nitrogen. Its symbol is just N. And it has seven protons, and it also has seven neutrons. So it has an atomic mass of roughly 14. Then this is the most typical isotope of nitrogen. And we talk about the word isotope in the chemistry playlist. An isotope, the protons define what element it is. But this number up here can change depending on the number of neutrons you have. So the different versions of a given element, those are each called isotopes. I just view in my head as versions of an element. So anyway, we have our atmosphere, and then coming from our sun, we have what's commonly called cosmic rays, but they're actually not rays. They're cosmic particles. You can view them as just single protons, which is the same thing as a hydrogen nucleus. They can also be alpha particles, which is the same thing as a helium nucleus. And there's even a few electrons. And they're going to come in, and they're going to bump into things in our atmosphere, and they're actually going to form neutrons. So they're actually going to form neutrons. And we'll show a neutron with a lowercase n, and a 1 for its mass number. And we don't write anything, because it has no protons down here. Like we had for nitrogen, we had seven protons. So it's not really an element. It is a subatomic particle. But you have these neutrons form. And every now and then-- and let's just be clear-- this isn't like a typical reaction. But every now and then one of those neutrons will bump into one of the nitrogen-14's in just the right way so that it bumps off one of the protons in the nitrogen and essentially replaces that proton with itself. So let me make it clear. So it bumps off one of the protons. So instead of seven protons we now have six protons. But this number 14 doesn't go down to 13 because it replaces it with itself. So this still stays at 14. And now since it only has six protons, this is no longer nitrogen, by definition. This is now carbon. And that proton that was bumped off just kind of gets emitted. So then let me just do that in another color. So plus. And a proton that's just flying around, you could call that hydrogen 1. And it can gain an electron some ways. If it doesn't gain an electron, it's just a hydrogen ion, a positive ion, either way, or a hydrogen nucleus. But this process-- and once again, it's not a typical process, but it happens every now and then-- this is how carbon-14 forms. So this right here is carbon-14. You can essentially view it as a nitrogen-14 where one of the protons is replaced with a neutron. And what's interesting about this is this is constantly being formed in our atmosphere, not in huge quantities, but in reasonable quantities. So let me write this down. Constant formation. And let me be very clear. Let's look at the periodic table over here. So carbon by definition has six protons, but the typical isotope, the most common isotope of carbon is carbon-12. So carbon-12 is the most common. So most of the carbon in your body is carbon-12. But what's interesting is that a small fraction of carbon-14 forms, and then this carbon-14 can then also combine with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. And then that carbon dioxide gets absorbed into the rest of the atmosphere, into our oceans. It can be fixed by plants. When people talk about carbon fixation, they're really talking about using mainly light energy from the sun to take gaseous carbon and turn it into actual kind of organic tissue. And so this carbon-14, it's constantly being formed. It makes its way into oceans-- it's already in the air, but it completely mixes through the whole atmosphere-- and the air. And then it makes its way into plants. And plants are really just made out of that fixed carbon, that carbon that was taken in gaseous form and put into, I guess you could say, into kind of a solid form, put it into a living form. That's what wood pretty much is. It gets put into plants, and then it gets put into the things that eat the plants. So that could be us. Now why is this even interesting? I've just explained a mechanism where some of our body, even though carbon-12 is the most common isotope, some of our body, while we're living, gets made up of this carbon-14 thing. Well, the interesting thing is the only time you can take in this carbon-14 is while you're alive, while you're eating new things. Because as soon as you die and you get buried under the ground, there's no way for the carbon-14 to become part of your tissue anymore because you're not eating anything with new carbon-14. And what's interesting here is once you die, you're not going to get any new carbon-14. And that carbon-14 that you did have at you're death is going to decay via beta decay-- and we learned about this-- back into nitrogen-14. So kind of this process reverses. So it'll decay back into nitrogen-14, and in beta decay you emit an electron and an electron anti-neutrino. I won't go into the details of that. But essentially what you have happening here is you have one of the neutrons is turning into a proton and emitting this stuff in the process. Now why is this interesting? So I just said while you're living you have kind of straight-up carbon-14. And carbon-14 is constantly doing this decay thing. But what's interesting is as soon as you die and you're not ingesting anymore plants, or breathing from the atmosphere if you are a plant, or fixing from the atmosphere. And this even applies to plants. Once a plant dies, it's no longer taking in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turning it into new tissue. The carbon-14 in that tissue gets frozen. And this carbon-14 does this decay at a specific rate. And then you can use that rate to actually determine how long ago that thing must've died. So the rate at which this happens, so the rate of carbon-14 decay, is essentially half disappears, half gone, in roughly 5,730 years. And this is actually called a half life. And we talk about in other videos. This is called a half life. And I want to be clear here. You don't know which half of it's gone. It's a probabilistic thing. You can't just say all the carbon-14's on the left are going to decay and all the carbon-14's on the right aren't going to decay in that 5,730 years. What it's essentially saying is any given carbon-14 atom has a 50% chance of decaying into nitrogen-14 in 5,730 years. So over the course of 5,730 years, roughly half of them will have decayed. Now why is that interesting? Well, if you know that all living things have a certain proportion of carbon-14 in their tissue, as kind of part of what makes them up, and then if you were to find some bone-- let's just say find some bone right here that you dig it up on some type of archaeology dig. And you say, hey, that bone has one half the carbon-14 of all the living things that you see right now. It would be a pretty reasonable estimate to say, well, that thing must be 5,730 years old. Even better, maybe you dig a little deeper, and you find another bone. Maybe a couple of feet even deeper. And you say, wow, you know this thing right over here has 1/4 the carbon-14 that I would expect to find in something living. So how old is this? Well, if it only has 1/4 the carbon-14 it must have gone through two half lives. After one half life, it would have had 1/2 the carbon. And then after another half life, half of that also turns into a nitrogen-14. And so this would involve two half lives, which is the same thing as 2 times 5,730 years. Or you would say that this thing is what? You'd say this thing is 11,460 years old, give or take.",science_biology_history-of-life-on-earth
" What I want to do with this video is think about what happens to some type of projectile, maybe a ball or rock, if I were to throw it straight up into the air. To do that I want to plot distance relative to time. There are a few things I am going to tell you about my throwing the rock into the air. The rock will have an initial velocity (Vi) of 19.6 meters per second (19.6m/s) I picked this initial velocity because it will make the math a little bit easier. We also know the acceleration near the surface of the earth. We know the force of gravity near the surface of the earth is the mass of the object times the acceleration. (let me write this down) The force of gravity is going to be the mass of the object times little g. little g is gravity near the surface of the earth g is 9.8 meters per second squared (9.8m/s^2) Now if you want the acceleration on earth you just take the force divided by the mass Because we have the general equation Force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma) If you want acceleration divide both sides by mass so you get force over mass So, lets just divide this by mass If you divide both sides by mass, on the left hand side you will get acceleration and on the right hand side you will get the quantity little g. The whole reason why I did this is when we look at the g it really comes from the universal law of gravitation. You can really view g as measuring the gravitational field strength near the surface of the earth. Then that helps us figure out the force when you multiply mass times g. Then you use F=ma, the second law, to come up with g again which is actually the acceleration. This is accelerating you towards the center of the earth. The other thing I want to make clear: when you talk about the Force of gravity generally the force of gravity is equal to big G Big G (which is different than little g) times the product of the masses of the two things over the square of the distance between the two things. You might be saying ""Wait, clearly the force of gravity is dependent on the distance. So if I were to throw something up into the air, won't the distance change."" And you would be right! That is technically right, but the reality is that when you throw something up into the air that change in distance is so small relative to the distance between the object and the center of the earth that to make the math simple, When we are at or near the surface of the earth (including in our atmosphere) we can assume that it is constant. Remember that little g over there is all of these terms combined. If we assume that mass one (m1) is the mass of the earth, and r is the radius of the earth (the distance from the center of the earth) So you would be correct in thinking that it changes a little bit. The force of gravity changes a little bit, but for the sake of throwing things up into our atmosphere we can assume that it is constant. And if we were to calculate it it is 9.8 meters per second squared and I have rounded here to the nearest tenth. I want to be clear these are vector quantities. When we start throwing things up into the air the convention is if something is moving up it is given a positive value, and if it is moving down we give it a negative value. Well, for an object that is in free fall gravity would be accelerating it downwards, or the force of gravity is downwards. So, little g over here, if you want to give it its direction, is negative. Little g is -9.8m/s2. So, we have the acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration due to gravity (ag) is negative 9.8 meters per second squared (9.8m/s^2). Now I want to plot distance relative to time. Let's think about how we can set up a formula, derive a formula that, if we input time as a variable, we can get distance. We can assume these values right over here. Well actually I want to plot displacement over time because that will be more interesting. We know that displacement is the same thing as average velocity times change in time (displacement=Vavg*(t1-t2)). Right now we have something in terms of time, distance, and average velocity but not in terms of initial velocity and acceleration. We know that average velocity is the same thing as initial velocity (vi) plus final velocity (vf) over 2. (Vavg=(vi+vf)/2) If we assume constant acceleration. We can only calculate Vavg this way assuming constant acceleration. Once again when were are dealing with objects not too far from the center of the earth we can make that assumption. Assuming that we have a constant acceleration Once again we don't have what our final velocity is. So, we need to think about this a little more. We can express our final velocity in terms of our initial velocity and time. Just dealing with this part, the average velocity. So we can rewrite this expression as the initial velocity plus something over 2. and what is final velocity? Well the final velocity is going to be your initial velocity plus your acceleration times change in time. If you are starting at 10m/s and you are accelerated at 1m/s^2 then after 1 second you will be going 1 second faster than that. (11m/s) So this right here is your final velocity. Let me make sure that these are all vector quantities...(draws vector arrows) All of these are vector quantities. Hopefully it is ingrained in you that these are all vector quantities, direction matters. And let's see how we can simplify this Well these two terms (remember we are just dealing with the average velocity here) These two terms if you combine them become 2 times initial velocity (2vi). two times my initial velocity and then divided by this 2 plus all of this business divided by this 2. which is my acceleration times my change in time divided by 2. All of this was another way to write average velocity. the whole reason why I did this is because we don't have final velocity but we have acceleration and we are going to use change in time as our independent variable. We still have to multiply this by this green change in time here. multiply all of this times the green change in time. All of this is what displacement is going to be. This is displacement, and lets see... we can multiply the change in time times all this actually these 2s cancel out and we get (continued over here) We get: displacement is equal to initial velocity times change in time Some physics classes or textbooks put time there but it is really change in time. change in time is a little more accurate plus 1/2 (which is the same as dividing by 2) plus one half times the acceleration times the acceleration times (we have a delta t times delta t) change in time times change in time the triangle is delta and it just means ""change in"" so change in time times change in time is just change in times squared. In some classes you will see this written as d is equal to vi times t plus 1/2 a t squared this is the same exact thing they are just using d for displacement and t in place of delta t. The one thing I want you to realize with this video is that this is a very straight forward thing to derive. Maybe if you were under time pressure you would want to be able to whip this out, but the important thing, so you remember how to do this when you are 30 or 40 or 50 or when you are an engineer and you are trying to send a rocket into space and you don't have a physics book to look it up, is that it comes from the simple displacement is equal to average velocity times change in time and we assume constant acceleration, and you can just derive the rest of this. I am going to leave you there in this video. Let me erase this part right over here. We are going to leave it right over here. In the next video we are going to use this formula we just derived. We are going to use this to actually plot the displacement vs time because that is interesting and we are going to be thinking about what happens to the velocity and the acceleration as we move further and further in time.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-class11th-physics-motion-in-a-straight-line
" SALMAN KHAN: I'm here with Dr. David Agus, who is a professor of engineering and medicine at USC. DAVID AGUS: Um-huh. SALMAN KHAN: And we're looking at pictures here of things that seem very different to me. What is the commonality right here? DAVID AGUS: The commonality is inflammation. So inflammation can be manifest by a runny nose in a cold or getting the flu. It could be manifest by an infection in your toes. It could be hitting your head playing football or hitting your arm when you fall playing a sport. All of those can cause inflammation. SALMAN KHAN: Because inflammation has a certain meaning in everyday language. At least when I imagine it, it means something that's swollen and red. But here, we're talking about inflammation in more of the medical or the scientific sense. Things are swollen and red because of inflammation. DAVID AGUS: Right. SALMAN KHAN: And so what is inflammation? It isn't just swollen and redness. I mean, the football player isn't getting swollen and red, or is he? DAVID AGUS: So inflammation is when your body senses danger. So when something is wrong, whether it be an infection, whether it be trauma in the case of football players, whether it be a cold, your body senses danger and sends in its frontline soldiers, which are the immune cells, in order to fight whatever's causing it. So if it's trauma, the immune cells go in there and they help rebuild the tissue that's damaged. If it's a bacteria, they go in there and they try to take away the bacteria so you can get over that cold or that flu. And so that whole process we call inflammation. SALMAN KHAN: I see. DAVID AGUS: It's a danger process. SALMAN KHAN: So it's the immune cells going to the sign of danger to either fight the danger itself or repair the aftermath-- DAVID AGUS: Yup. SALMAN KHAN: --of the danger. So that sounds like a good thing. DAVID AGUS: It's an awesome thing. The problem is, your body, all of us, we care about what happens today, not down the road. SALMAN KHAN: Right. DAVID AGUS: And this is one of the take home points that astonished me when I start to think about it, is that nature, evolution, selects out, for who has good kids. And that's what evolution is about. It's about having children. We call progeny. SALMAN KHAN: Right DAVID AGUS: It's not about what happens when you're 80 years old or 90 years old. And so inflammation is fantastic about dealing with today's ramifications. The problem is if you get the flu today, your risk of cancer and heart disease a decade or two decades from now are up. SALMAN KHAN: If I get the flu once? DAVID AGUS: If you get the flu once. SALMAN KHAN: Really. DAVID AGUS: So those five, six days-- SALMAN KHAN: You're worrying me. DAVID AGUS: --when you feel horrible, your inflammation is through the roof. That's having ramifications down the road. SALMAN KHAN: Right. I mean this is already getting a little scary for me because I've had the flu. So I already feel a little worried about my cancer risk. DAVID AGUS: I can tell by looking at you. [LAUGHTER] SALMAN KHAN: You can tell by looking at-- [LAUGHTER] And the symptoms that we get when we have the flu or a cold, these are actually-- it's not the virus that's-- the virus is causing the inflammation, which is causing the symptoms. DAVID AGUS: Yeah. And that's what's wild. Is that when you get a virus, your immune system attacks it and you get a fever. I still don't know why we get fevers. It's one of those things where the-- we call them the cytokines, which are proteins the immune cells make to send out and get more reinforcements and tell the body what to do. It causes a fever. Is a fever good? Is a fever bad? I don't know. We take Tylenol to lower a fever, but is that a good thing? Nobody really has looked at the long-term ramifications. They look at short term. But how does it affect a decade from now what's going to happen? We just don't know. SALMAN KHAN: Wow. Wow. And what you're saying is that the reason why we have inflammation is, yeah, something has happened to my body. I have some trauma, some injury. And you were saying this to me earlier, you might have to run away from a lion tomorrow. So fix Sal or fix David up right now, so that he can run away from the lion tomorrow. But in the wild, I might only live to 40 anyway. So why even worry about whether that person might get cancer if they get to 40 or 50, once they're past the age of reproduction. DAVID AGUS: Eactly. The body has to choose priorities. And the priority clearly is today rather than tomorrow. And so an amazing study was done in that we gave patients what we call a statin. So statins were drugs-- S-T-A-T-I-N. They were drugs that were developed because they blocked the synthesis of cholesterol. SALMAN KHAN: Right. DAVID AGUS: And we thought people with higher cholesterol, particularly the bad one called LDL, those people have a higher incidence of heart disease. So if we block the synthesis, we're going to affect heart disease. And what do you know, we did. A dramatic effect, we lowered the death from heart disease with these drugs. SALMAN KHAN: Right. So it seems like they worked. DAVID AGUS: They worked. Then a company, or a very clever group, did a trial where they gave people with normal cholesterol these drugs. And they had a dramatic effect in that it delayed heart attack and stroke by almost a dozen years. SALMAN KHAN: Wow. DAVID AGUS: And it reduced the incidence of cancer by about 40%. SALMAN KHAN: So cancer, something-- I mean we don't associate cholesterol-- DAVID AGUS: Totally different. SALMAN KHAN: Wow. DAVID AGUS: So it turns out these drugs, which were the biggest drug in terms of sales we've ever had, worked by lowering inflammation. So their effect in heart disease wasn't by lowering cholesterol. It was predomitly by lowering inflammation. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. DAVID AGUS: And the effect on cancer was by lowering inflammation. In fact, do you remember when the swine flu came out a couple years ago? SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. DAVID AGUS: So if you got the swine flu, the only thing that protected you from your lungs collapsing and going on what we call a ventilator, a breathing machine, was being on one of these statins. SALMAN KHAN: Because it would stop the inflammation. Because the swine flu people were dying from is the inflammation going nuts. DAVID AGUS: Yeah. SALMAN KHAN: This is fascinating. So the people who are dying of heart disease, is it necessarily the cholesterol that's killing them? Or is the inflammation that's causing cholesterol? DAVID AGUS: Well, I think it's this chicken and the egg phenomenon. That's it. The inflammation allows cholesterol to deposit-- SALMAN KHAN: I see. DAVID AGUS: --and they together. SALMAN KHAN: I see. I see. So it's really the statin affects inflammation, which then reduces cancer by stopping the inflammation and stopping the-- DAVID AGUS: Exactly. SALMAN KHAN: --cholesterol. DAVID AGUS: One of those problems we have a biology, in medicine, it's what you can measure. And so I can measure cholesterol. SALMAN KHAN: Right. DAVID AGUS: I don't really know how to measure inflammation well. So while we can make these association in big studies when we look back, if I had a metric, if I had a blood test or something to look at for inflammation, I can optimize things. SALMAN KHAN: Can you not measure just the amount of cytokines and other inflammatory type of things that become increased in your-- does it happen? DAVID AGUS: You're right. But are different types of inflammation. So some inflammation can be good, some can be bad. Some can be really causal. Some could be a little bit causal. And so we're putting them all into one basket now, which is inflammation. The key is to start to tease them out and be able to modulate them. You can develop a drug. But then you have to optimize it for a particular purpose. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. DAVID AGUS: So these were optimized to lower cholesterol. And they do that very well. They also lower inflammation and they work beautifully in that regard. But how do we optimize that going forward? What it also means is that when you look at your lifestyle and my lifestyle, we have to limit inflammation. So what are the easy ways to do that? One is, which I think should be mandatory things, like the flu shot. SALMAN KHAN: Right. DAVID AGUS: So again, the flu shot will certainly delay you from having or prevent from having bad flu. SALMAN KHAN: That's good today and good today and tomorrow. DAVID AGUS: And tomorrow-- SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. DAVID AGUS: --because it limits heart disease and cancer down the road. That SALMAN KHAN: I had no clue that the flu-- I thought it was just a nice thing, avoid a week of sneezing, and you know. But the flu shot, you can actually reduce your cancer-- DAVID AGUS: And heart disease down the road. And we have to think long term as a society. SALMAN KHAN: What about statins? I mean it seems like-- these are drugs like Lipitor and Crestor. I mean would you-- I mean no one should take our medical advice based on a thing in video. DAVID AGUS: Right. SALMAN KHAN: I mean are people taking it just for heart disease or are people taking it more broadly now? DAVID AGUS: Listen. I mean I'm a believer that these drugs have such a profound effect on cancer, heart disease, stroke, potentially Alzheimer's, that you should consider taking it to prevent these diseases. And again, we're giving no recommendations. But what I say is you, your parents, they should talk about it with their doctor. And so why shouldn't I be on this drug? SALMAN KHAN: Right. And there are some side effects. But they're easy to test for. DAVID AGUS: Test for, and then they're reversible. SALMAN KHAN: Right. OK. So you're not going too-- DAVID AGUS: So with anything, you got to do a risk and a benefit. SALMAN KHAN: Right. DAVID AGUS: And you have to look at you and say am I high risk for X, Y, and Z? If you are, what can prevent or delay it? The name of the game is not treating disease, it's preventing disease. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. Now, this is fascinating. Well, I might talk to my wife about getting some-- well, no advice here. Everyone should talk to their doctor. DAVID AGUS: By the way, another great medicine to reduce inflammation is called aspirin. SALMAN KHAN: Aspirin, I've heard of that. DAVID AGUS: Yeah. It's a hell of a drug. Again, there are side effects to aspirin. It can affect bleeding. But at the same time, it's a dramatic effect by lowering inflammation. SALMAN KHAN: Right. And that is its main side effect. I mean it's this age-old drug. It's a blood thinner. So if you get a cut or you bleed while you're taking aspirin, you might bleed more. DAVID AGUS: Right. Blood thinner is a funny term. I'm not quite sure what it means. I keep taking paint thinner when you see it. SALMAN KHAN: Right. That's kind of how I imagine it. DAVID AGUS: It binds to the platelets and blocks them from activating. It stops them from working really well. SALMAN KHAN: So it's more anticlotting. DAVID AGUS: Right. And platelets are one of the key components of clotting. And they certainly affect it. SALMAN KHAN: Right. So your blood will have the same viscosity. It just won't clot as easily. DAVID AGUS: Exactly. And you could certainly paint a wall with either one. SALMAN KHAN: That's a little morbid. All right. Well, thanks a bunch.",science_health-and-medicine_healthcare-misc
" I was just looking on the discussion boards on the Khan Academy Facebook page, and Bud Denny put up this problem, asking for it to be solved. And it seems like a problem of general interest. If the indefinite integral of 2 to the natural log of x over, everything over x, dx. And on the message board, Abhi Khanna also put up a solution, and it is the correct solution, but I thought this was of general interest, so I'll make a quick video on it. So the first thing when you see an integral like this, is you say, hey, you know, I have this natural log of x up in the numerator, and where do I start? And the first thing that should maybe pop out at you, is that this is the same thing as the integral of one over x times 2 to the natural log of x, dx. And so you have an expression here, or it's kind of part of our larger function, and you have its derivative, right? We know that the derivative, let me write it over here, we know that the derivative with respect to x of the natural log of x is equal to 1/x. So we have some expression, and we have its derivative, which tells us that we can use substitution. Sometimes you can do in your head, but this problem, it's still not trivial to do in your head. So let's make the substitution. Let's substitute this right here with a u. So let's do that. So if you define u, and it doesn't have to be u, it's just, that's the convention, it's called u-substitution, it could have been s-substitution for all we care. Let's say u is equal to the natural log of x, and then du dx, the derivative of u with respect to x, of course is equal to 1/x. Or, just the differential du, if we just multiply both sides by dx is equal to 1 over x dx. So let's make our substitution. This is our integral. So this will be equal to the indefinite integral, or the antiderivative, of 2 to the now u, so 2 to the u, times 1 over x dx. Now what is 1 over x dx? That's just du. So this term times that term is just our du. Let me do it in a different color. 1 over x times dx is just equal to du. That's just equal to that thing, right there. Now, this still doesn't look like an easy integral, although it's gotten simplified a good bit. And to solve, you know, whenever I see the variable that I'm integrating against in the exponent, you know, we don't have any easy exponent rules here. The only thing that I'm familiar with, where I have my x or my variable that I'm integrating against in my exponent, is the case of e to the x. We know that the integral of e to the x, dx, is equal to e to the x plus c. So if I could somehow turn this into some variation of e to the x, maybe, or e to the u, maybe I can make this integral a little bit more tractable. So let's see. How can we redefine this right here? Well, 2, 2 is equal to what? 2 is the same thing as e to the natural log of 2, right? The natural log of 2 is the power you have to raise e to to get 2. So if you raise e to that power, you're, of course going to get 2. This is actually the definition of really, the natural log. You raise e to the natural log of 2, you're going to get 2. So let's rewrite this, using this-- I guess we could call this this rewrite or-- I don't want to call it quite a substitution. It's just a different way of writing the number 2. So this will be equal to, instead of writing the number 2, I could write e to the natural log of 2. And all of that to the u du. And now what is this equal to? Well, if I take something to an exponent, and then to another exponent, this is the same thing as taking my base to the product of those exponents. So this is equal to, let me switch colors, this is equal to the integral of e, to the u, e to the, let me write it this way. e to the natural log of 2 times u. I'm just multiplying these two exponents. I raise something to something, then raise it again, we know from our exponent rules, it's just a product of those two exponents. du. Now, this is just a constant factor, right here. This could be, you know, this could just be some number. We could use a calculator to figure out what this is. We could set this equal to a. But we know in general that the integral, this is pretty straightforward, we've now put it in this form. The antiderivative of e to the au, du, is just 1 over a e to the au. This comes from this definition up here, and of course plus c, and the chain rule. If we take the derivative of this, we take the derivative of the inside, which is just going to be a. We multiply that times the one over a, it cancels out, and we're just left with e to the au. So this definitely works out. So the antiderivative of this thing right here is going to be equal to 1 over our a, it's going to be 1 over our constant term, 1 over the natural log of 2 times our whole expression, e e. And I'm going to do something. This is just some number times u, so I can write it as u times some number. And I'm just doing that to put in a form that might help us simplify it a little bit. So it's e to the u times the natural log of 2, right? All I did, is I swapped this order. I could have written this as e to the natural log of 2 times u. If this an a, a times u is the same thing as u times a. Plus c. So this is our answer, but we have to kind of reverse substitute before we can feel satisfied that we've taken the antiderivative with respect to x. But before I do that, let's see if I can simplify this a little bit. What is, if I have, just from our natural log properties, or logarithms, a times the natural log of b. We know this is the same thing as the natural log of b to the a. Let me draw a line here. Right? That this becomes the exponent on whatever we're taking the natural log of. So u, let me write this here, u times the natural log of 2, is the same thing as the natural log of 2 to the u. So we can rewrite our antiderivative as being equal to 1 over the natural log of 2, that's just that part here, times e to the, this can be rewritten based on this logarithm property, as the natural log of 2 to the u, and of course we still have our plus c there. Now, what is e raised to the natural log of 2 to the u? The natural log of 2 to the u is the power that you have to raise e to to get to 2 to the u, right? By definition! So if we raise e to that power, what are we going to get? We're going to get 2 to the u. So this is going to be equal to 1 over the natural log of 2. This simplifies to just 2 to the u. I drew it up here. The natural log a I could just write in general terms, let me do it up here, and maybe I'm beating a dead horse. But I can in general write any number a as being equal to e to the natural log of a. This is the exponent you have to raise e to to get a. If you raise e to that, you're going to get a. So e to the natural log of 2 to the u, that's just 2 to the u. And then I have my plus c, of course. And now we can reverse substitute. What did we set u equal to? We defined u, up here, as equal to the natural log of x. So let's just reverse substitute right here. And so the answer to our original equation, your answer to, let me write it here, because it's satisfying when you see it, to this kind of fairly convoluted-looking antiderivative problem, 2 to the natural log of x over x dx, we now find is equal to, we just replaced u with natural log of x, because that was our substitution, and 1 over the natural log of 2 times 2 to the natural log of x plus c. And we're done. This isn't in the denominator, the way I wrote it might look a little ambiguous. And we're done! And that was a pretty neat problem, and so thanks to Bud for posting that.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-integrals
" -  So we have a bunch of numbers listed up here, and my goal, in this video, is to see if we can classify them into different types of number categories, and let me draw the categories. So this circle, over here, this represents all of the numbers that can be represented as the fraction of two integers, and, of course, the denominator can't be equal to zero, because we don't know what it means to put a zero in the denominator. So, let's call these, or the standard way of calling these things. These things can be represented as a fraction of two integers, we call these rational numbers. Rational numbers. And if something cannot be represented as a fraction of two integers, we call irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. And the size of these circles don't show how large these sets are. There's actually an infinite number of rational and an infinite number of irrational numbers. So, these are the irrational numbers. Irrational. So, these cannot be represented as a fraction of two integers. And then, within rational numbers, you have integers themselves. So, I'll do that in, let me do that in this blue color. Integers. So, integers are numbers that don't have to be represented as a fraction or a decimal. So, these are integers, right over here. Integers. And then a subset of integers are whole numbers. So, if you essentially say the non-negative integers, you're then talking about whole numbers. So let me do that subset, right over here. So, these are going to be the whole numbers. So, whole numbers. Whole numbers, right over here. And, actually, let me just label it all. These are rational... Let me do that in the same color. Rational numbers. And, of course, irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. An integer. Well, if I could say, ""Look, that is an integer. ""Let's think about the integers."" But I wouldn't say, ""Let's just think about the rational."" I'd say, ""Let's think about the rational numbers."" All right, now that we have these categories in place, let's categorize them. Like always, pause the video. See if you can figure out what category these numbers fall into. Where would you put them on this diagram? So, let's start off with three. This is positive three. It can be definitely represented as a fraction. You can represent it as three over one. But, it doesn't have to be represented as a fraction. It, literally, could be just a three, right over there, but it's also non-negative. So three is a whole number. So three, and maybe I'll do it in the color of the category. So, three is a whole number. So, it's a member of that set. But if you're a whole number, you're also an integer, and you're also a rational number. So, three is a whole number, it's an integer, and it's a rational number. Now, let's think about negative five. Now, negative five, once again, it can be represented as a fraction, but it doesn't have to be, but it is negative. So, it's not gonna be a whole number. So, negative five is going to sit right over here. It's an integer, and if you're an integer, you're definitely going to be a rational number, but it's not a whole number because it is negative. Now we have 0.25. Well, this, for sure, can be represented as a fraction. This is 25-hundredths, right over here. So, we can represent that as a fraction of two integers, I should say. It's 25-hundredths. But there's no way to represent this except using a fraction of two integers. So, 0.25 is a rational number, but it's not an integer and not a whole number. Now what about 22 over seven. Well, here it's clearly represented, already, as a fraction of two integers, but I don't think I can represent this any other, except as a fraction of two integers. I can't somehow make this without using a fraction or some type of decimal that might repeat. So, this, right over here, this would also be a rational number, but it's not an integer, not a whole number. Now this over here. 0.2713. Now the 13 repeats. This is the same thing as 0.27131313, that's what line up there represents. Now, you might not realize it yet, but any number that repeats eventually, this one does repeat eventually, you have the .1313, or you have the 0.27131313, any number like this can be represented as a fraction. For example, and I'm not going to do it here, just for the sake of time, but, for example, 0.3, repeating, that's the same thing as one-third. And later on, we're gonna see techniques of how do you convert this to a fraction of two integers. But, for our sake, we just know that this can be represented as a fraction of two integers just the way that 0.3, repeating, can be. And so, we would put this under rational numbers. 0.2713, repeating. But you have to represent it either as a decimal or a fraction of integers. If you didn't have to, then it could have been an integer, but we'll throw it up there in rational numbers. Now the square root of ten. Square root of ten. This is interesting. So, any square root of a non-perfect square is going to be irrational. So, this is gonna be irrational. I'm not proving it to you here, but you cannot represent this as the ratio of two integers, or a fraction with two integers, with an integer in the numerator and an integer in the denominator. This will be, if you were to represent it as a decimal, it will not repeat. It'll just keep being new and new digits. It will not repeat over time. So, this, right over here, is an irrational number. It's not rational. It cannot be represented as the ratio of two integers. All right, 14 over seven. This is the ratio of two integers. So, this, for sure, is rational. But if you think about it, 14 over seven, that's another way of saying, 14 over seven is the same thing as two. These two things are equivalent. So, 14 over seven is the same thing as two. So, this is actually a whole number. It doesn't look like a whole number, but, remember, a whole number is a non-negative number that doesn't need to be represented as the ratio of two integers. And this one, even though we did represent it as the ratio of two integers, it doesn't need to be represented as the ratio of two integers. You could have represent this as just two. So, that's going to be a whole number. 14 over seven, which is the same thing as two, that is a whole number. Now, two-pi. Now pi is an irrational... Pi is an irrational number. So if we just take a multiple of pi, if we just take a integer multiple of pi, like that, this is also going to be an irrational number. If you looked at its decimal representation, it will never repeat. So that's two-pi, right over there. Now what about... Let me do that same, since I've been consistent, relatively consistent, with the colors. So, this is two-pi right over there. Now, what about the negative square root of 25. Well, 25's a perfect square. Square root of that's just gonna be five. So, this thing is going to be, this thing is going to be equivalent to negative five. So, this is just another representation of this, right over here. So, it is an integer. It's not a whole number because it's negative, but it's an integer. Negative square root of 25. These two things are actually... These two things are actually the same number, just different ways of representing them. And then you have, let's see, you have the square root of nine over... The square root of nine over seven. Well, what's the principal root of nine? This thing is gonna be the same thing, this thing is the same... Let me do this in a different color. This is the same thing as, square root of nine is three, it's the principal root of nine, so it's three-sevenths. So, this is a ratio of two integers. This is a rational number. Square root of nine over seven is the same thing as three-sevenths. Now, let me just give you one more just for the road. What about pi over pi? What is that going to be? Well, pi divided by pi is going to be equal to one. So, this is actually a whole number. So I could write pi over pi, right over there. That's just a very fancy way of saying one.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-numbers-operations
"  Let's do some more nonhomogeneous equations. So let's take the same problem, but we'll change the right-hand side. Because I think you know how to solve the-- essentially, the homogeneous version. So the same problem as we did in the last video. The second derivative of y minus 3 times the first derivative y minus 4 times the function. And now in the last example, the nonhomogeneous part was 3e to the 2x. But we're tired of dealing with exponent functions, so let's make it a trigonometric function. So let's say it equals 2 sin of x. So the first step you do is what we've been doing. You essentially solve the homogeneous equation. So this left-hand side is equal to 0. You do that by getting the characteristic equation r squared minus 3r minus 4 is equal to 0. You get the solutions, r is equal equal to 4, r is equal to minus 1, and then you get that general solution. We did this in the last video. You get the general solution of the homogeneous. Maybe we'll call this the homogeneous solution. y homogeneous. We've got the C1 e to the 4x plus C2e to the minus x. And that's all and good, but in order to get the general solution of this nonhomogeneous equation, I have to take the solution of the nonhomogeneous equation, if this were equal to 0, and then add that to a particular solution that satisfies this equation. That satisfies-- when you take the second derivative minus 3 times the first minus 4 times the function, I actually get 2 sin of x. And here once again we'll use undetermined coefficients. And undetermined coefficients, just think to yourself. What function, when I take its second and first derivatives and add and subtract multiples of them to each other, will I get sine of x? Well, two functions end up with sine of x when you take the first and second derivatives. And the sine and cosine of x. So it's a good guess. And that's really what you're doing it the method of undetermined coefficients. You take a guess of a particular solution and then you solve for the undetermined coefficients. So let's say that our guess is y is equal to-- I don't know, some coefficient times sine of x. And if this was sine of 2x, I'd put A times sine of 2x here. Just because I still want-- no matter what happens here-- the sine of 2x's or maybe cosine of 2x's to still exist. If this was a sine of 2x, there's nothing I could do to a sine of x, or nothing at least trivial that I could do to the sine of x. It would end up with a sine of 2x. So whatever's here, I want here. Plus B, some undetermined coefficient times cosine of x. And once again, this was sine of 2x. I'd want a cosine of 2x here. So let's figure out its first and second derivatives. So the first derivative of this y prime is equal to A cosine of x. Cosine derivative is minus sine, so minus B sine of x. And then the second derivitive-- I'll write down here. The second derivative is equal to what? Derivative of cosine is minus sine, so minus A sine of x minus B cosine of x.  I think you're starting to see that the hardest thing in most differential equations problems is not making careless mistakes. It's a lot of algebra and a lot of fairly basic calculus. And the real trick is to not make careless mistakes. Every time I say that, I tend to make one. So I'm going to focus extra right now. So anyway, let's take these and substitute them back into this nonhomogeneous equation. Let's see if I can solve for A and B. So the second derivative is that.  Let me just rewrite it, just so that you see what I'm doing. So I'm going to take the second derivative, y prime prime, so that's minus A sine of x minus B cosine of x. I'm going to add minus 3 times the first derivative to that. And I'm going to write the sines under the sines and the cosines under the consines. So minus 3 times this. So the sine is, let's see. It's plus 3B sine of x minus 3 times this. So minus 3A cosine of x. And then minus 4 times our original function. So minus 4A sine of x. Right? Minus 4 times that. Minus 4 times this. Minus 4B cosine of x. And when I take the sum of all of those-- that's essentially the left-hand side to this equation-- when I take the sum of all of that, that is equal to 2 sine of x. I could have written them out in a line, but it would have just been more confusing. And now this makes it easy to add up the sine of x's and the cosine of x's. So if I add up all the coefficients on the sine of x, I get minus A plus 3B minus 4A. So that looks like minus 5A plus 3B sine of x plus-- and now what are the coefficients here?  I have minus B and then I have another minus 4B, so minus 5B and then minus 3A. So minus 3A minus 5B cosine of x. The cosine of x should go right here. So anyway, how do I solve for A and B? Well, I have the minus 5A 3B is equal to whatever coefficients in front of sine of x here. So minus 5A plus 3B must be equal to 2. And then minus 3A minus 5B is the coefficient on cosine of x, although I kind of squeezed in the cosine of x here, right? So this must be equal to whatever the coefficient on cosine of x is on the right-hand side. Well the coefficient of cosine of x on the right-hand side is 0. So that sets up a system of two unknowns with two equations. A linear system. So we get minus 5A plus 3B is equal to 2. And we get minus 3A minus 5B is equal to 0.  And let's see if I can simplify this a little bit. Let's see. This is a system of two unknowns, two equations. If I multiply the top equation by 5 1/3s, right? Actually, let me multiply the top equation by 5 1/3s. I get minus 25/3 A plus 5B is equal to 5 1/3s times this. 5 1/3s times 2 is 10 1/3s. And the bottom equation is minus 3A minus 5B is equal to 0. Let's add the two equations. I get 10 1/3s is equal to-- these cancel out. That's minus 25/3 minus 9/3 A is equal to 10 1/3s. This is getting a little bit messier than I like, but we'll soldier on. So minus 25 minus 9. What's minus 25 minus 9? So that is 34. So we get 34 over 3A is equal to 10/3. We can multiply both sides by 3. Divide both sides by 34. A is equal to 10/34, which is equal to 5/17. Nice ugly number. 5/17 and now we can solve for B. So let's see. Minus 3 times A minus 3 times A. 5/17 minus 5B is equal to 0. So that's what? Minus 15/17 is equal to plus 5B. I just took this and put it on the right-hand side. And then divide both sides by 5.  Oh, you know what? I realized I made a careless mistake here. Minus 25 minus 9. That's the minus 34 over 3. so minus 34A is equal to 10. A is equal to minus 10/34 or minus 5/17. So minus 3 times minus 5/17. So 5/17 is equal to plus 5B, right? And then we get B is equal to 3/17. 1That was hairy. 1And notice, the hard part was not losing 1your negative sines. 1But anyway, we now have our particular solution to this. 1 1let me try to write in a non-nauseating color, although 1I think I picked a nauseating one. 1The particular solution is A minus 5/17 sine of x-- right? 1That was a coefficient on sine of x-- plus B plus 3/17 times 1cosine of x. 1And if we look at our original problem, the general solution 1out of this nonhomogeneous equation would be this-- which 1is the general solution to the homogeneous equation, which 1we've done many videos on-- plus now our particular 1solution that we solved using the method of undetermined 1coefficient. 1So if you just take that and add it to that, you're done. 1And I am out of time. 1See you in the next video.",math_differential-equations_second-order-differential-equations
" This problem is from chapter five of the Kotz, Treichel, Townsend Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity textbook. So they tell us, suppose you want to know the enthalpy change-- so the change in total energy-- for the formation of methane, CH4, from solid carbon as a graphite-- that's right there-- and hydrogen gas. So we want to figure out the enthalpy change of this reaction. How do we get methane-- how much energy is absorbed or released when methane is formed from the reaction of-- solid carbon as graphite and hydrogen gas? So they tell us the enthalpy change for this reaction cannot to be measured in the laboratory because the reaction is very slow. So normally, if you could measure it you would have this reaction happening and you'd kind of see how much heat, or what's the temperature change, of the surrounding solution. Maybe this is happening so slow that it's very hard to measure that temperature change, or you can't do it in any meaningful way. We can, however, measure enthalpy changes for the combustion of carbon, hydrogen, and methane. So they're giving us the enthalpy changes for these combustion reactions-- combustion of carbon, combustion of hydrogen, combustion of methane. And they say, use this information to calculate the change in enthalpy for the formation of methane from its elements. So any time you see this kind of situation where they're giving you the enthalpies for a bunch of reactions and they say, hey, we don't know the enthalpy for some other reaction, and that other reaction seems to be made up of similar things, your brain should immediately say, hey, maybe this is a Hess's Law problem. Hess's Law. And all Hess's Law says is that if a reaction is the sum of two or more other reactions, then the change in enthalpy of this reaction is going to be the sum of the change in enthalpies of those reactions. Now, when we look at this, and this tends to be the confusing part, how can you construct this reaction out of these reactions over here? And what I like to do is just start with the end product. So I like to start with the end product, which is methane in a gaseous form. And when we look at all these equations over here we have the combustion of methane. So this actually involves methane, so let's start with this. But this one involves methane and as a reactant, not a product. But what we can do is just flip this arrow and write it as methane as a product. So if we just write this reaction, we flip it. So now we have carbon dioxide gas-- let me write it down here-- carbon dioxide gas plus-- I'll do this in another color-- plus two waters-- if we're thinking of these as moles, or two molecules of water, you could even say-- two molecules of water in its liquid state. That can, I guess you can say, this would not happen spontaneously because it would require energy. But if we just put this in the reverse direction, if you go in this direction you're going to get two waters-- or two oxygens, I should say-- I'll do that in this pink color. So two oxygens-- and that's in its gaseous state-- plus a gaseous methane. CH4. CH4 in a gaseous state. And all I did is I wrote this third equation, but I wrote it in reverse order. I'm going from the reactants to the products. When you go from the products to the reactants it will release 890.3 kilojoules per moles of the reaction going on. But if you go the other way it will need 890 kilojoules. So the delta H here-- I'll do this in the neutral color-- so the delta H of this reaction right here is going to be the reverse of this. So it's positive 890.3 kilojoules per mole of the reaction. All I did is I reversed the order of this reaction right there. The good thing about this is I now have something that at least ends up with what we eventually want to end up with. This is where we want to get. This is where we want to get eventually. Now, if we want to get there eventually, we need to at some point have some carbon dioxide, and we have to have at some point some water to deal with. So how can we get carbon dioxide, and how can we get water? Well, these two reactions right here-- this combustion reaction gives us carbon dioxide, this combustion reaction gives us water. So we can just rewrite those. Let me just rewrite them over here, and I will-- let me use some colors. So if I start with graphite-- carbon in graphite form-- carbon in its graphite form plus-- I already have a color for oxygen-- plus oxygen in its gaseous state, it will produce carbon dioxide in its gaseous form. It will produce carbon-- that's a different shade of green-- it will produce carbon dioxide in its gaseous form. And this reaction, so when you take the enthalpy of the carbon dioxide and from that you subtract the enthalpy of these reactants you get a negative number. Which means this had a lower enthalpy, which means energy was released. Because there's now less energy in the system right here. So this is essentially how much is released. But our change in enthalpy here, our change in enthalpy of this reaction right here, that's reaction one. I'll just rewrite it. Minus 393.5 kilojoules per mole of the reaction occurring. So the reaction occurs a mole times. This would be the amount of energy that's essentially released. This is our change in enthalpy. So if this happens, we'll get our carbon dioxide. Now we also have-- and so we would release this much energy and we'd have this product to deal with-- but we also now need our water. And this reaction right here gives us our water, the combustion of hydrogen. So we have-- and I haven't done hydrogen yet, so let me do hydrogen in a new color. That's not a new color, so let me do blue. So right here you have hydrogen gas-- I'm just rewriting that reaction-- hydrogen gas plus 1/2 O2-- pink is my color for oxygen-- 1/2 O2 gas will yield, will it give us some water. Will give us H2O, will give us some liquid water. Now, before I just write this number down, let's think about whether we have everything we need. To make this reaction occur, because this gets us to our final product, this gets us to the gaseous methane, we need a mole. Or we can even say a molecule of carbon dioxide, and this reaction gives us exactly one molecule of carbon dioxide. So that's a check. And we need two molecules of water. Now, this reaction only gives us one molecule of water. So let's multiply both sides of the equation to get two molecules of water. So this is a 2, we multiply this by 2, so this essentially just disappears. You multiply 1/2 by 2, you just get a 1 there. And then you put a 2 over here. So I just multiplied this second equation by 2. So I just multiplied-- this is becomes a 1, this becomes a 2. And if you're doing twice as much of it, because we multiplied by 2, the delta H now, the change enthalpy of the reaction, is now going to be twice this. Let's get the calculator out. It's now going to be negative 285.8 times 2. Because we just multiplied the whole reaction times 2. So negative 571.6. So it's negative 571.6 kilojoules per mole of the reaction. Now, let's see if the combination, if the sum of these reactions, actually is this reaction up here. And to do that-- actually, let me just copy and paste this top one here because that's kind of the order that we're going to go in. You don't have to, but it just makes it hopefully a little bit easier to understand. So let me just copy and paste this. Actually, I could cut and paste it. Cut and then let me paste it down here. That first one. And let's see now what's going to happen. To see whether the some of these reactions really does end up being this top reaction right here, let's see if we can cancel out reactants and products. Let's see what would happen. So this produces carbon dioxide, but then this mole, or this molecule of carbon dioxide, is then used up in this last reaction. So this produces it, this uses it. So those cancel out. Let me do it in the same color so it's in the screen. This reaction produces it, this reaction uses it. Now, this reaction right here produces the two molecules of water. And now this reaction down here-- I want to do that same color-- these two molecules of water. Now, this reaction down here uses those two molecules of water. Now, this reaction right here, it requires one molecule of molecular oxygen. This one requires another molecule of molecular oxygen. So these two combined are two molecules of molecular oxygen. So those are the reactants. And in the end, those end up as the products of this last reaction. So those, actually, they go into the system and then they leave out the system, or out of the sum of reactions unchanged. So they cancel out with each other. So we could say that and that we cancel out. And so what are we left with? What are we left with in the reaction? Well, we have some solid carbon as graphite plus two moles, or two molecules of molecular hydrogen yielding-- all we have left on the product side is some methane. 1So it is true that the sum of these reactions is exactly 1what we want. 1All we have left on the product side is the graphite, 1the solid graphite, plus the molecular hydrogen, plus the 1gaseous hydrogen-- do it in that color-- plus 1two hydrogen gas. 1And all we have left on the product side is the methane. 1All we have left is the methane in the gaseous form. 1So it is true that the sum of these reactions-- remember, we 1have to flip this reaction around and change its sign, 1and we have to multiply this reaction by 2 so that the sum 1of these becomes this reaction that we really care about. 1So this is the sum of these reactions. 1Its change in enthalpy of this reaction is going to be the 1sum of these right here. 1That is Hess's Law. 1So this is the fun part. 1So we just add up these values right here. 1So we have negative 393.-- no, that's not 1what I wanted to do. 1Let me just clear it. 1So I have negative 393.5, so that step is exothermic. 1And then we have minus 571.6. 1That is also exothermic. 1Those were both combustion reactions, which are, as we 1know, very exothermic. 1And we have the endothermic step, the reverse of that last 1combustion reaction. 1So plus 890.3 gives us negative 74.8. 1It gives us negative 74.8 kilojoules for every mole of 1the reaction occurring. 1Or if the reaction occurs, a mole time. 1So there you go. 1We figured out the change in enthalpy. 1And it is reasonably exothermic. 1Nowhere near as exothermic as these combustion reactions 1right here, but it is going to release energy. 1And we're done.",science_chemistry_thermodynamics-chemistry
" I'm now going to show you what I think are probably the two coolest derivatives in all of calculus. And I'll reserve that. None of the other ones have occurred to me right now. But these are definitely to me some of the neatest. So let's figure out what the derivative of the natural log is. And just as a review, what is the natural log? Well the natural log of something is the exact same thing as saying logarithm base e of that something. That's just a review. So let's take the derivative of this. I think I'm going to need a lot of space for this. I'm going to try to do it as neatly as possible. So the derivative of the natural log of x equals-- well let's just take the definition of a derivative, right? We just take the slope at some point and find the limit as we take the difference between the two points to 0. So let's take the limit as delta x approaches 0 of f of x plus delta x. So I'm going to take the limit of this whole thing. The natural log ln of x plus delta x-- right, that's like one point that I'm going to take evaluate the function-- minus the ln of x. All of that over delta x. And if you remember from the derivative videos, this is just the slope, and I'm just taking the limit as I find the slope between a smaller and a smaller distance. Hopefully you remember that. So let's see if we can do some logarithm properties to simplify this a little bit. Hopefully you remember-- and if you don't, review the logarithm properties-- but remember that log of a minus log of b is equal to log of a over b, and that comes out of the fact that logarithm expressions are essentially exponents, so they follow the exponent rules. And if that doesn't make sense to you, you should review those as well. But let's apply this logarithm property to this equation. So let me rewrite the whole thing, and I'm going to keep switching colors to keep it from getting monotonous. So we have the limit as delta x approaches 0 of this big thing. Let's see. So log of a minus b equals log a over b, so this top, the numerator, will equal the natural log of x plus delta x over x. Right? a b a/b, all of that over delta x. And so that equals the limit as delta x approaches 0-- I think it's time to switch colors again-- delta x approaches 0 of-- well let me just write this 1 over delta x out in front. So this is 1 over delta x, and we're going to take the limit of everything. ln x divided by x is 1 plus delta x over x. Fair enough. Now I'm going to throw out another logarithm property, and hopefully you remember that-- and let me put the properties separate so you know it's not part of the proof-- that a log b is equal to log of b to the a. And that comes from when you take something to an exponent, and then to another exponent you just have to multiply those two exponents. I don't want to confuse you, but hopefully you should remember this. So how does apply here? Well this would be a log b. So this expression is the same thing as the limit. The limit as delta x approaches 0 of the natural log of 1 plus delta x over x to the 1 over delta x power. And remember all this is the natural log of this entire thing. And then we're going to take the limit as delta x approaches 0. If you've watched the compound interest problems and you know the definition of e, I think this will start to look familiar. But let me make a substitution that might clean things up a little bit. Let me make the substitution, let me call it n-- no, no, no, let me call u-- is equal to delta x over x. And then if that's true then we can multiply both sides by x and we get xu is equal to delta x. Or we would also know that 1 over delta x is equal to 1 over xu. These are all equivalent. So let's make the substitution. So if we're taking the limit is delta x approaches 0, in this expression if delta x approaches 0, what does u approach? u approaches 0. So delta x approaching 0 is the same exact thing as taking the limit as u approaches 0. So we can write this as the limit as u approaches 0 of the natural log of 1 plus-- well we did the substitution, delta x over x is now u-- to the 1 over delta x, and that same substitution told us that's the same thing as one over xu. Remember we're taking the natural log of everything. And we know this is an exponent property, which I'll now do in a different color. We know that a to the bc is equal to a to the b to the c power. So that tells us that this me is equal to the limit as u approaches 0 of the natural log of 1 plus u to the 1/u, because this is one over xu, right? 1/u, and then all of that to the 1/x. And how did I do that? Just from this exponent property, right? If I were to simplify this, I would have 1/x times 1/u, and that's where I get this 1 over xu. Well then we can just do this logarithm property in reverse. If I have b to the a I can put that a out front. So I could take this 1/x and put it in front of the natural log. So now what do I have? We're almost there. We have the limit as u approaches 0. Take that 1/x, put it in front of the natural log sign. 1/x times the natural log of 1 plus u to the 1/u. Fair enough. When we're taking the limit as u approaches 0, x, this term doesn't involve it at all. So we could take this out in front, because the limit doesn't affect this term. And then we're essentially saying what happens to this expression as the limit as u approaches 0. So this thing is equivalent to 1/x times the natural log of the limit as u approaches 0 of 1 plus u to the 1/u. And by now hopefully you would recognize that this is the definition. This limit comes to e, if you remember anything from compound interest. You might remember it as the limit-- as n approaches infinity of 1 plus 1 over n to the n. But these things are equivalent. If you just took the substitution u is equal to 1/n, you would get this. You would just get this. So this expression right here is e That expression is e. So we're getting close. So this whole thing is equivalent to 1/x times the natural log, and this we know, this is one of the ways to get to e. So the limit as u approaches 0 of 1 plus u to the 1/u. That is e. And what is the natural log? Well it's the log base e. So you know this is equal to 1/x times the log base e of e. So that's saying e to what power is e. Well e to the first power is e, right? This is equal to 1. So 1 times 1/x is equal to 1/x. There we have it. The derivative of the natural log of x is equal to 1/x, which I find kind of neat, because all of the other exponents lead to another exponent. But all of a sudden in the mix here you have the natural log and the derivative of that is equal to x to the negative 1 or 1/x. Fascinating.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-advanced-differentiation-two
" -  The function F is defined over the real numbers. This table gives select values of F. We have our table here. For these X values, it gives the corresponding F of X. What is a reasonable estimate for the limit of F of X as X approaches one from the left? So pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. Alright, now let's work through this together. So the first thing that is really important to realize is when you see this X approaches one and you see this little negative superscript here, this does not mean approaching negative one, so this does not mean negative one. Sometimes your brain just sees a one and that little negative sign there, and you're like oh, this must be a weird way of writing negative one, or you don't even think about it, but it's not saying that. It's saying, this is saying, let me put a little arrow here, this is the limit of F of X as X approaches one from the left, from the left. So from the left, how do we know that? Well that's what that little negative tells us. It tells us we're approaching one from values less than one. If we were approaching one from the right, from values greater than one, that would be a positive sign right over there. So let's think about it. We want the limit as X approaches one from the left, and lucky for us on this table, we have some values of X approaching one from the left. 0.9, which is already pretty close to one, then we get even closer to one from the left. Notice, these are all less than one, but they're getting closer and closer to one. And so what we really wanna look at is what does F of X approach as X is getting closer and closer to one, from the left, from the left. And a key realization here is, if we're thinking about general limits, not just from one direction, then we might wanna look at from the left and from the right, but they're asking us only from the left, so we should only be looking at these values right over here. In fact, we shouldn't even let the value of F of X at X equal one confuse us. Sometimes and oftentimes, the limit is approaching a different value than the value of the function at that point. So let's look at this. At 0.9, F of X is 2.5. When we get even closer to one from the left, we go to 2.1. When we get even closer to one from the left, we're getting even closer to two. So a reasonable estimate for the limit as X approaches one from the left of F of X, it looks like F of X right over here is approaching two. We don't know for sure, that's why they're saying, what is a reasonable estimate. It might be approaching 2.01 or it might be approaching 1.999. On Khan Academy these will often be multiple choice questions, so you have to pick the most reasonable one, it would not be fair if they gave a 1.999 as a choice and 2.01, but if you were saying, hey, maybe this was approaching a whole number, then two could be a reasonable estimate right over here. Although it doesn't have to be two, it could be 2.01258, it might be what it is actually approaching. So let's try another example here. Here it does look like there's a reasonable estimate for the limit as we approach this value from the left. So now, it says the function F is defined over the real numbers. This table gives select values of F, similar to the last question. What is a reasonable estimate for the limit as X approaches negative two from the left? So this is confusing. You see these two negative signs. This first negative sign tells us we're approaching negative two. We wanna say, what happens we're approaching negative two, and we're gonna approach once again from the left. So lucky for us, they have values of X that are approaching negative two from the left, so this is X approaches negative two from the left, so that is happening right over here. So that's these values. So notice, this is negative 2.05, then we get even closer, negative 2.01, then we get even closer, negative 2.002, and these are from the left because these are values less than negative two, but they're getting closer and closer to negative two. And so let's see, when we're a little bit further, F of X is negative 20, we get a little bit closer, it's negative 100, we get even a little bit closer, it goes to negative 500. So it would be reasonable, and we don't know for sure, this is just giving us a few sample points for this function, but if we follow this trend, as we get closer and closer to negative two, without getting there, it looks like this is getting unbounded. It looks like it's becoming infinitely negative. And so technically, it looks like this is, I would write this is unbounded, and so if this was a multiple choice question, technically you would say the limit as X approaches negative two from the left does not exist, does not exist. If someone asked the other question, if they said, what is the limit as X approaches negative two from the right of F of X, well then you would say, alright, well here are values approaching negative two from the right, so this is X approaching negative two from the right, right over here. And remember, when you're looking at a limit, sometimes it might be distracting to look at the actual value of the function at that point, so we wanna think about what is the value of the function approaching, as your X is approaching that value, as X is approaching, in this case, negative two, from the right. So as we're getting closer and closer to negative two from values larger than negative two, it looks like F of X is getting closer and closer to negative four, which is F of negative two, but that actually seems like a reasonable estimate. Once again, we don't know absolutely for sure, just by sampling some points, but this would be a reasonable estimate. And in general, if you are approaching different values from the left than from the right, then you would say, a that point, the limit of your function does not exist, and we have seen that in other videos.",math_ap-calculus-ab_ab-limits-new
" Make a table and solve. A biologist is researching the impact of three different water-based sugar drinks on bees ability to make honey. He takes 2 liters of Drink A, which contains 40% sugar. So let me write this down. Let me make our table and then we can solve it. So let's take amount of drink. And then we'll say percent sugar. And then we can say sugar quantity, so the actual physical quantity of sugar. Maybe I should say sugar amount, or amount of sugar. Now this first drink, Drink A, it says he takes 2 liters of Drink A, which contains 40% sugar. The first column will be which drink we're talking about, so Drink A, he takes 2 liters of it. It's 40% sugar. So if we want the actual amount of sugar in liters, we just multiply 2 liters times 40%, or times 0.4. Let me write times with a dot so you don't think it's an x. 2 times 0.4, which is equal to 0.8 liters of sugar. So you have 0.8 liters of sugar. 1.2 liters of I guess the other stuff in there is water. But it's 0.8 of the 2 liters is sugar, which is 40%. Now,, he adds 1.2 liters of Drink B. He finds that bees prefer this new solution, Drink C. So when you add these two together, you end up with Drink C. And we end up with how much of Drink C? 2 plus 1.2 is 3.2 liters of Drink C, which has 25% sugar content. So this is 25% sugar, which also says we know the amount of sugar in it. Because if we have 3.2 liters of it and it's 25% sugar, or it's 1/4 sugar, that means that we have 0.8 liters of sugar here. So this is 0.8 liters of sugar. Well, that I already wrote in the column name. That's the amount of sugar. It's 25% sugar. We have 3.2 liters of it. Now, they want to know what is the percentage of sugar in Drink B? So let's just call that x. So that's right over here. Now, if it's x percent sugar here, or this is the decimal equivalent, that's x, how much sugar do we have? We have 1.2 liters times the decimal equivalent of sugar, so this is going to be 1.2 times x. Now let's think about it. We have 0.8 liters of sugar in Drink A, and when you add this amount to it, you still have 0.8 liters of actual sugar in Drink C. So this thing has to be equal to zero. We could set up an equation here. We could write 0.8 plus 1.2x is equal to 0.8. You subtract 0.8 from both sides. You get 1.2x is equal to 0. x has got to be equal to 0. So this thing right here has got to be zero. There's no sugar in Drink B. It's just got to be like 1.2 liters. I guess the solution is water. So it's 1.2 liters of water. There's no sugar in Drink B. It is 0% sugar.",math_algebra-home_alg-basic-eq-ineq
" - In this video, we are going to talk about baking soda. You might have seen this white power in your kitchen. We use this to make puffy bhaturas, or samosas, or to bake soft cakes. So first of all in this video, we will se how baking soda is made. Then we will look at its uses. Let's begin. Baking soda is chemically known as sodium hydrogen carbonate. It is chemical formula is NaHCO3. Now let's try to guess what chemical compounds would have reacted to give us this compound, sodium hydrogen carbonate. Can you pause the video and guess this by yourself first? If you have tried it, let's see. If I had to take a guess, I see a sodium in the formula, right? I will say that sodium chloride is reacting and sodium is coming from there. Then I see a carbon, so then I would guess that carbon dioxide is also involved in the reaction. That's where we get this carbon. Since there is hydrogen, I'll guess hydrogen is coming from water. My guess is going to be sodium chloride, water, and carbon dioxide. These three are reacting to give us NaHCO3. Let me just write it down. There is one more ingredient, one more compound that goes into this mixture. That is ammonia, NH3. Sodium chloride water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia all react and NaHCO3 is formed. With this we get one more product, NH4Cl, ammonium chloride. So to make baking soda, I need four ingredients: sodium chloride, water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia. Don't forget this one. I usually forget this one. Don't do this mistake. We need four reactants and then I'll get baking soda or sodium hydrogen carbonate, and along with this one more product is getting formed, ammonium chloride. Now let's look at the common uses of baking soda. We use baking soda to make puffed bhaturas or samosas. Puffed basically means inflated with gas. How this is done is we mix some baking soda in the flour. Flour basically means atta. When this is deep-fried, the baking soda gets heated up and it decomposes to give carbon dioxide gas. The reaction looks something like this. Baking soda on heating. It will decompose to give sodium carbonate, Na2CO3, water, and carbon dioxide gas is released. This gas gets trapped inside. That's why our bhatura looks very puffed. See over here, samosa also looks very puffed, right? The same thing can also be used to make soft cakes. You would have seen that cakes have holes in it and they are very soft and spongy, right? Something very similar is happening to make them soft and spongy. Over here also, when they are being baked, carbon dioxide gas gets produced and it gets trapped inside. It's trying to escape. Because of which the cake becomes very puffy. It becomes soft. But there's a problem. If I had mixed baking soda into the dough of the cake and when I had heated it, this would have decomposed to give me carbon dioxide definitely, yes that is helpful, but also with that I would have got Na2CO3 and this is basic in nature. Now you will think, ""Why is that a problem?"" You might recall that bases taste bitter whereas cakes are supposed to taste sweet, right? This is going to spoil the taste of our cake and that's what we don't want. So that's why we do not use baking soda to bake cakes. Instead we use baking power, which is a mixture of baking soda and a mild edible acid, tartaric acid. So we mix baking soda with tartaric acid and we get baking powder. If you're wondering what is the chemical formula for tartaric acid, don't worry about that. Just know that tartaric acid has H plus, it can give H plus ion because it's an acid and it has some negative ion. Some random negative ion. I'm denoting that with X minus, so it's chemical formula will be ""HX,"" just to keep things simple over here. Now you might be thinking, ""what is the chemical reaction that's happens here?"" Let's do that. Over here, we will get a double displacement reaction and the ions are goin to exchange position. Now sodium plus ion will get attracted to X minus ion, whatever the X was, and we will get NaX. This will be a salt. Our H plus will now get attracted to HCO3 minus. We will get H2CO3. Plus H2Co3. We have seen that this is not very stable. This will quickly decompose. This will quickly breakdown into water and carbon dioxide. Let me just remove it. H2O and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide gas will be involved here. In this case also, we are getting carbon dioxide gas, which will make the cake very soft and fluffy. In this case we are getting NaX, which is a salt and this will not spoil the taste of our cake. That's why this is a good combination to use to bake cakes or cookies. Since baking soda uses carbon dioxide, it has got a lot of use in cooking. For the same reason, it is also used in fire extinguishers. Carbon dioxide can extinguish fires, and that's why we use baking soda in soda-acid fire extinguishers. Also, baking soda is basic in nature so this can be used as an antacid. If you have an acidity, or excess buildup in your stomach, then you can take a little bit of baking soda and this can neutralize the acid buildup in your stomach and give you relief. Since baking soda is basic in nature, it can be used as an antacid. If you're wondering, ""How is baking soda basic in nature?"" Baking soda is a salt, NaHCO3 and we can try to find out its nature. Salts can also be acidic or basic, right? Let's write out its acid and base and then try to find out its nature. The base over here would be NaOH. NaOH. The acid would be H2CO3. We know that this base is a strong base and this acid is a weak acid. Whenever a strong base reacts with a weak acid, we get a basic salt. So this is going to be a basic salt. If you do not understand what I did over here, then don't worry. I have talked about this. We have studied this in detail in a separate video, so you can watch that and come back over here. This tells us that NaHCO3, or baking soda, is basic in nature. That's why we can use it as an antacid. Let's summarize the video. In this video, we spoke a lot about baking soda. We looked at its chemical formula and also how it gets prepared. I hope that you remember how many reactants were involved to make this and what were those reactants. We also saw that baking soda has two properties. One, that it gives out a lot of carbon dioxide gas and based on this property, we saw two use cases of baking soda. The other property was that it is basic in nature and based on this, we saw the third use case of baking soda. I hope you remember all of these points. If you don't, then don't worry. You can go back and watch the video again.",science_in-in-class-10-chemistry-india_in-in-acids-bases-and-salts
" -  ""Which of the ordered pairs is a ""solution of the following equation?"" 4x minus one is equal to 3y plus five. Now, when we look at an ordered pair we wanna figure out whether it's a solution, we just have to remind ourselves that in these ordered pairs the convention, the standard, is is that the first coordinate is the x coordinate, and the second coordinate is the y coordinate. So they're gonna, if this is a solution, if this ordered pair is a solution, that means that if x is equal to three and y is equal to two, that that would satisfy this equation up here. So let's try that out. So, we have four times x. Well we're saying x needs to be equal to three, minus one, is going to be equal to three times y. Well, if this ordered pair is a solution then y is going to be equal to two, so three times y, y is two, plus five. Notice all I did is wherever I saw the x, I substituted it with three, wherever I saw the y, I substituted it with two. Now let's see if this is true. Four times three is twelve, minus one. Is this really the same thing as three times two which is six, plus five? See, 12 minus one is 11, six plus five is also 11. This is true, 11 equals 11. This pair three, two does satisfy this equation. Now let's see whether this one does, two, three. So this is saying when x is equal to two, y would be equal to three for this equation. Let's see if that's true. So four times x, we're now gonna see if when x is two, y can be three. So four times x, four times two, minus one is equal to three times y, now y we're testing to see if it can be three. Three times three plus five, let's see if this is true. Four times two is eight, minus one, is this equal to three times three? So that's nine plus five. So is seven equal to 14? No, clearly seven is not equal to 14. So these things are not equal to each other. So this is not a solution, when x equals two y cannot be to three and satisfy this equation. So only three, two is a solution.",math_algebra-basics_alg-basics-graphing-lines-and-slope
" We've already learned that cellular respiration can be broken down into roughly three phases. The first is glycolysis, which literally means the breaking down of glucose. And then this can occur with or without oxygen. If we don't have oxygen, then we go over to fermentation. We'll talk about that in the future. Go over to fermentation and in humans it produces lactic acid. In other types of organisms it might produce alcohol or ethanol. But if we have oxygen-- and for the most part we're going to assume that we can proceed forward with oxygen-- if there is oxygen, then we could proceed forward to the Krebs cycle. Sometimes called the citric acid cycle because it deals with citric acid. The same thing that's in orange juice or lemons. And then from there we proceed to the electron transport chain. And we learned in the first overview video of cellular respiration that this is where the bulk of the ATP is actually produced. Although it uses raw materials that came out of these phases up here. Now what I want to do in this video is just focus on glycolysis. And this is kind of-- it's sometimes a challenging task because you can really get stuck in the weeds. And I'll show you the weeds in a little bit, and the actual mechanism. And it can be very daunting. But what I want to do is simplify it for you so you can have the big take-aways. And then we can appreciate, and then maybe when we look at the weeds of glycolysis we can make a little bit more sense of it. So glycolysis, or really cellular respiration, it starts off with glucose. And glucose, we know its formula. It's C6H12O6. And I could draw its whole structure; it would take a little time. But I'm just going to focus on the carbon backbone. So it is a ring, or can be a ring. But I'm just going to draw it as six carbons in a row. Now there's two kind of important phases of glycolysis that are good to know. One, I call the investment phase. And the investment phase actually uses two ATPs. So you know, the whole purpose of cellular respiration is to generate ATPs, but right from the get-go I actually have to use two ATPs. But I use two ATPs and then I'm essentially going to break up the glucose into two 3-carbon compounds right here that actually also have a phosphate group on them. The phosphate groups are coming from those ATPs. They also have a phosphate group on them and this is often called-- well, there's a lot of names for it. Sometimes it's called PGAL. You really don't have to know this. Or phosphoglyceraldehyde, really challenging my spelling skills right here. That's not that important to know. All you have to know is in this first phase you use two ATPs. That's why I call it the investment phase. If we use a business analogy, investment phase. And then each of these two PGAL molecules can then go into the payoff phase. So in the payoff phase, each of these PGALs turn into pyruvate. Which is another 3-carbon, but it's reconfigured. But the process of it going to pyruvate-- and let me write pyruvate in blue, because this is something that, at least it's good to know the word. And I'll show you the structure in a second. Pyruvate. Sometimes it's called pyruvic acid. Same thing. And that's essentially the end product of glycolysis. So you start off with glucose in the investment phase. You end up in this phosphoglyceraldehyde, which essentially you broke up your glucose and you put a phosphate on either end of it. And then those each independently go through the payoff phase. So you end up with two molecules of pyruvate for every molecule of glucose you started off with. Now you're saying, hey, Sal, there was a payoff phase, what was our payoff? Well our payoff, we got, for each-- let me write this down as a payoff phase. This is our payoff phase. And I apologize for the white background. I did it because, the mechanism I'm showing you, I copy-and-pasted it from Wikipedia, and they had a white background so I just ran with the white background for this video. But I, personally at least, like the black background a lot better. But this is the payoff phase right here. And so when we go from the phosphoglyceraldehyde to the pyruvate or the pyruvic acid, we produce two things. Or I guess we could say we produce three things. We produce, each of these PGALs to pyruvates produce two ATPs. So I'm going to produce two ATPs there, I'm going to produce two ATPs there. And then they each produce an NADH. And I'll do it in a darker color. NADH. And of course they're not producing the whole molecule in a vacuum. Essentially what they're doing is they're starting with the raw material of an NAD plus-- so they start off with an NAD plus-- and they essentially reduce it by adding a hydrogen. Remember, we learned a couple of videos ago that you could view reduction as a gain in hydrogen. So the NAD gets reduced to NADH. And then later on, these NADHs are used in electron transport chain to actually produce ATPs. So the big take-away here, if I were to write the reaction that we get for glycolysis, is that you start off with a glucose. And you need some NAD plus. And actually, for every mole of glucose, you're going to need two NAD plusses. You're going to need two ATPs. So I'm just writing all the ingredients that we need to start off with. And then you're going to need-- well, let me say, these guys are going to be ADPs before we turn them to ATPs. So I'll write plus four ADPs. And then, after performing glycolysis-- and let me write it here. Let me write also-- sorry that was ADPs. Let me just rewrite that part right there. Four ADPs. And then you maybe need two phosphate groups. Because we're going to need four phosphate groups. Plus four-- I'll just call them, sometimes they're written like that. But maybe I'll write it like this. Four phosphate groups. And then once you perform glycolysis, you have two pyruvates, you have two NADHs. The NAD has been reduced. It gained a hydrogen. RIG. OIL RIG. Reduction is gain an electron. But in the biological sense, we think of it gaining the hydrogen. Because hydrogen is very non-electronegative, so you're hogging its electrons. You've gained its electrons. So two NADHs and then plus these two ATPs get used in the investment phase. That's why I kind of wrote them a little separately. So these two get used. So then you're left with two ADPs. And then these guys, essentially, get turned into ATPs. So plus four ATPs. I guess we didn't need four. We only needed a net of two phosphate groups. Because two jump off of here. And then we need a total of two more to get four jumping on there. But the big picture is, you start with a glucose, you end up with two pyruvates. You use up two ATPs. You get four ATPs. So you have a net of two ATPs formed. Let me write that very big. Net, what you get out of glycolysis, is two ATPs. You get two NADHs that can each later be used in the electron transport chain to produce three ATPs. You get two NADHs and you get two pyruvates, which are going to be re-engineered into acetyl-CoAs that are going to be the raw materials for the Krebs cycle. But these are the outputs of glycolysis. So now that we have that big picture, let's actually look at the mechanism. Because this is a little bit more daunting when you see it here. But we'll see the same themes that I just talked about. We're starting with a glucose right there. It is a six chain. It's in a circle, in a ring. One, two, three, four, five, six carbons. I could write it like that, just to make a huge oversimplification. It goes through a few steps. I use an ATP here. So let me do that in a color. Let me do it in orange whenever I use an ATP. I use one ATP there. I use one ATP there. And just like I told you, they have a slightly different name for it. But this is the phosphoglyceraldehyde right here. They call it glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. It's the exact same molecule. But as you can see, just when I drew it very roughly before, 1you've got one, two three carbons there. 1And it also has a phosphate group on it. 1The phosphate group's actually attached to the oxygen. 1But for just for simplification I draw the 1phosphate group just like that. 1And I showed that right here. 1This was the 1phosphoglyceraldehyde right here. 1This is the actual structure up here. 1But I think sometimes when you look at the structure it's 1easy to miss the big picture. 1And there are two of these. 1They kind of say that you can go back and forth with this, 1with this other kind of isomer of this. 1But the important thing is that you have two of these 1compounds that are now 3-carbon compounds. 1Glucose has been split. 1And now we're ready to enter the payoff phase. 1Remember you have two of these compounds right here. 1That's why, when they drew this mechanism, they wrote 1times two right there. 1Because the glucose has been split into 1two of these molecules. 1So each of the molecules are now going to 1do this right here. 1And for each of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates, 1or PGALs, or phosphoglyceraldehyde, we can 1look at the mechanism and say, OK look here, there's going to 1be an ADP turning into an ATP there. 1So this is plus one ATP. 1And then we see it again happening here 1on our way to pyruvate. 1On our way to pyruvate right, there then we have another 1plus one ATP. 1So for each of the PGALs, or the phosphoglyceraldehydes 1that were produced, we're producing two ATPs in the 1payoff phase. 1Now there were two of these. 1So total for one glucose, we're going to produce four 1ATPs in the payoff phase. 1So in the payoff phase, four ATPs. 1In the investment phase we used one, two ATPs. 1So total net ATPs directly generated from 1glycolysis is two ATPs. 1Four, gross produced. 1But we had to invest two in the investment phase. 1And then the NADs and the NADHs, we see right here. 1For each phosphoglyceraldehyde, or 1glyceraldehyde 3-phosphates or PGALs or whatever you want to 1call them, at this stage right here you see that we are 1reducing NAD plus to NADH. 1So this happens once for each of these compounds. 1And obviously there are two of these. 1Glucose got split into two of these guys. 1So two NADHs are going to be produced. 1And later these are going to be used in the electron 1transport chain to actually each produce three ATPs. 1And then finally, when everything is said and done, 1we're left with the pyruvates. 1And it's nice, at least that they made it nice and big. 1We can take a look at what a pyruvate looks like. 1And just as promised, we can look at all the oxygen bonds 1and all that. 1But it's a 3-carbon structure. 1It has a 3-carbon backbone. 1So the end result is that the carbon, that the glucose got 1split in half. 1It got oxidized. 1Some of the hydrogens got stripped off of it. 1As you can see there's only three hydrogens here. 1We started off with 12 hydrogens in glucose. 1And now it has its carbons bonding more 1strongly with oxygen. 1So it's essentially having its electrons stolen by the 1oxygens, or hogged by the oxygens. 1So carbon has gotten oxidized in this process. 1There's going to be more oxidation left to do. 1And in the process we were able to generate two net ATPs 1and two NADHs that can later be used to produce ATPs. 1Anyway, hopefully you found that helpful.",science_biology_cellular-respiration-and-fermentation
" (light music) -  We're looking at the main types of biodiversity, genetic, ecological, and evolutionary. Here we want to really focus on the latter, talk about evolutionary lineages. Something that I live and breathe in my own scientific research. The study of evolutionary lineages is nothing less than analyzing biodiversity over time. We always want to know where did biodiversity come from, where is it going and what is the role of humans in the future of these patterns. Lineages allow us to look at the evolutionary history of different species, so the study of evolutionary lineages is also the study of the tree of life. Scientists use that tree metaphor to depict actual relationships among organismal groups in a branching diagram, but how do you make that diagram, what do you need to know that will allow us to assemble that tree of life? What we're talking about is a science known as phylogenetic systematics. Phylogenetic patterns are made up of characters, features you can observe in organisms. Sounds pretty simple but what it really means is that a unique feature of an organism represents a unique event in the evolutionary history of that organism an event that marks the first appearance of that feature. And if you look at several organisms and list the unique features of those organisms, you are actually looking at the unique events in their histories that tell you something about their relationships. This is because these events can be shared with other organisms, if they are shared, their histories are shared. In other words the species are related. Think about sea urchins for example, who wouldn't want to think about sea urchins, they're pretty neat animals, they have long spines, nice rounded bodies supporting those spines, but did you know that sand dollars are basically flat sea urchins that have adapted to life on the beach, which I think is pretty nice work if you can get it. So if sand dollars are sea urchins, can we identify some evolutionary novelty that joins all the sand dollars together to the exclusion of all other types of sea urchins? Can we put them together in a single lineage? Here's our sea urchin and here is our sand dollar, but here's another type of sand dollar, the obvious feature that links these two guys is that they are as we said, really flat but no other sea urchins are flat like this, that's a character that uniquely connects all of the sand dollars together to the exclusion of all other sea urchins. A feature that's arisen only once in the evolutionary history of the sea urchins that led to the sand dollars. The suggestion is that these two guys share common ancestry, a common history because right at this point they evolved as characteristic of being flat. With the sand dollar group, all of which we now know share a common ancestry, you can have further elaborations on this flat form. For example, some will have weird holes through their bodies that also represent unique evolutionary events within the sand dollar grouping. And this is another critical thing to recognize about the tree of life. Every group is nested or included within another group, nature is a hierarchy that can be represented by these branching diagrams, diagrams known as cladograms or phylogenetic trees. But things can be really complicated, we know that there is some 250 living species of sand dollars and over 750 extinct fossil species. We also know there's a single phylogenetic tree for sand dollars showing how they're all related one to another. But we don't know the precise shape the branching order also known as the topology of that tree. Each sub-grouping can be supported by a unique evolutionary novelty or even several if you have lots of data. The aim is to best arrange all the unique characters to resolve or support all of the relationships. Ultimately the idea is to make a branch point for every single one of the relationships so we can document the unique evolutionary events or characters among all the species being studied. One thing that emerges from all of this is the simple fact that some species have appeared on earth more recently than others, you can read this from the topology of the tree when you realize that there's a time axis along here, oldest to most recent. The important thing is the relative branching order, the topology of the tree. This branch point occurred before that one and that branch point occurred before both of those. But let's face it, with ten million species on earth, the tree of life can get pretty complicated which is why it takes a lot of data and a lot of studies to place as accurately as possible each group of organisms on that big tree. So for phylogenetic systematics, you need to use a computer, taking lots and lots of character data, coding character traits for every species in your analysis and feeding that into a computer program. There are mathematical processes to produce trees that can be tested and tested again with new characters with the aim of arriving at the most supportable hypothesis for the topology of the tree. Sometimes these new characters can lead to changes in the branching order of the tree. And there's something relatively new on the scene to help phylogeneticists test these hypotheses of relationships and that of course is DNA. Evolutionary pathways and novel features are recorded just as much in DNA as they might be in the physical traits of an organism that you can see with your eyes. Phylogeneticists rely more and more on the analysis of large amounts of molecular data to develop trees. With the grand view of these trees in hand, you get an even more powerful way of looking at how evolution happens you can actually read life's history book which I think is one of the most exciting things you can possibly do in this field of study. For example, in the case of the sand dollars, I can explore why they got flat or why they have these bizarre holes in them, using the tree to tell a story of evolution, it's what I live for in my science. One of the first ever cladograms appeared in the work of none other than Charles Darwin, who recognized the importance of evolutionary trees. I always think of old Chuck when I think of this grand picture of life, this grand picture of biodiversity and how trees show that. Darwin knew that these trees reveal lineages and big picture biodiversity against a background of enormous time. What he didn't know was just how powerful our modern techniques could become in telling a spectacular story and how useful these trees are in helping us protect earth's amazing but threatened biodiversity.

" In the next few videos I'm going to embark on something that will just result in a formula that's pretty straightforward to apply. And in most statistics classes, you'll just see that end product. But I actually want to show how to get there. But I just want to warn you right now. It's going to be a lot of hairy math, most of it hairy algebra. And then we're actually going have to do a little bit of calculus near the end. We're going to have to do a few partial derivatives. So if any of that sounds daunting, or sounds like something that will discourage you in some way, you don't have to watch it. You could skip to the end and just get the formula that we're going to derive. But I, at least, find it pretty satisfying to actually derive it. So what we're going to think about here is, let's say we have n points on a coordinate plane. And they all don't have to be in the first quadrant. But just for simplicity of visualization, I'll draw them all in the first quadarant. So let's say I have this point right over here. Let me do them in different colors. And that coordinate is x1, y1. And then let's say I have another point over here. The coordinates there are x2, y2. And then I can keep adding points. And I could keep drawing them. We'd just have a ton of points. There and there and there. And we go all the way to the nth point. Maybe it's over here. And we're just going to call that xn, yn. So we have n points here. I haven't drawn all of the actual points. But what I want to do is find a line that minimizes the squared distances to these different points. So let's think about it. Let's visualize that line for a second. So there's going to be some line. And I'm going to try to draw a line that kind of approximates what these points are doing. So let me draw this line here. So maybe the line might look something like this. I'm going to try my best to approximate it. Actually, let me draw it little bit different. Maybe it looks something like that. I don't even know what it looks like right now. And what we want to do is minimize this squared error from each of these points to the line. So let's think about what that means. So if the equation of this line right here is y is equal to mx plus b. And this just comes straight out of Algebra 1. This is the slope on the line, and this is the y-intercept. This is actually the point 0, b. What I want to do, and that's what the the topic of the next few videos are going to be, I want to find an m and a b. So I want to find these two things that define this line. So that it minimizes the squared error. So let me define what the error even is. So for each of these points, the error between it and the line is the vertical distance. So this right here we can call error one. And then this right here would be error two. It would be the vertical distance between that point and the line. Or you can think of it as the y value of this point and the y value of the line. And you just keep going all the way to the endpoint between the y value of this point and the y value of the line. So this error right here, error one, if you think about it, it is this value right here, this y value. It's equal to y1 minus this y value. Well what's this y value going to be? Well over here we have x is equal to x1. And this point is the point m x1 plus b. You take x1 into this equation of the line and you're going to get this point right over here. So that's literally going to be equal to m x1 plus b. That's that first error. And we can keep doing it with all the points. This error right over here is going to be y2 minus m x2 plus b. And then this point right here is m x2 plus b. The value when you take x2 into this line. And we keep going all the way to our nth point. This error right here is going to be yn minus m xn plus b. Now, so if we wanted to just take the straight up sum of the errors, we could just some these things up. But what we want to do is a minimize the square of the error between each of these points, each of these n points on the line. So let me define the squared error against this line as being equal to the sum of these squared errors. So this error right here, or error one we could call it, is y1 minus m x1 plus b. And we're going to square it. So this is the error one squared. And we're going to go to error two squared. Error two squared is y2 minus m x2 plus b. And then we're going to square that error. And then we keep going, we're going to go n spaces, or n points I should say. We keep going all the way to this nth error. The nth error is going to be yn minus m xn plus b. And then we're going to square it. So this is the squared error of the line. And over the next few videos, is I want to find the m and b that minimizes the squared error of this line right here. So if you viewed this as the best metric for how good a fit a line is, we're going to try to find the best fitting line for these points. And I'll continue in the next video. Because I find that with these very hairy math problems, it's good to kind of just deliver one concept at a time. And it also minimizes my probability of making a mistake.",math_statistics-probability_describing-relationships-quantitative-data
" We're all used to the traditional operators like addition and subtraction and multiplication and division. And we've seen there's multiple ways to represent this. But what we're going to do in this video is a little fun. We're actually going to define our own operators. And what's neat about this is it kind of shows how broad mathematics can be. And on a more practical sense, it's actually something that you might see on some standardized tests. And the reason why they do that is so that you can appreciate that these aren't the only operators out there-- plus exponentiation and all those-- that in mathematics, you can define a whole new set of operators. So let's just do that. So let me just define x diamond y. And I'm going to define that as 5x minus y. So you could view this as defining it a function. But we're defining it using an operator. So if I have x diamond y, by definition, we have defined this operator. That means that's going to be equal to 5x minus y. So given that definition, what would 7 diamond 11 be? Well, you just go to the definition. 7 diamond 11. Instead of an x we have a 7. So it's going to be 5 times 7. So let me do it 5 times 7 minus, and instead of a y, we have an 11. So one way to think about it is, in our definition, every place you saw an x, you could replace with a 7, every place you saw a y, you replace with an 11. So you have minus 11 over here. Let me make the number-- So this is the 7. This 7 is this 7. And this 11 is this 11 right over here. And then we just evaluate that. So 5 times 7 is 35. So this is equal to 35 minus 11, which is equal to 24. So 7 diamond 11 is equal to 24. We can define other things. We can define something crazy like, let me define a-- well, I mentioned a star, let me use a star-- a star-- let me write it this way-- a star b. Let's say that that is the same thing as-- I don't know-- a over a plus b. And so same idea. What would 5 star 6 be? Well, you go back to the definition. By definition, every place where you see the a, you would now replace with a 5. Every time you saw the b, you would now replace with a 6. So this is going to be equal to 5 over 5 plus 6. a plus b. a is 5, b is 6 over 5 plus 6. So this would be 5/11. And then you can compound them. And we haven't defined any order of operations for these particular operations that we've just defined. So we're going to be careful to use parentheses when we put some of these together, but you can do something like, something interesting, like negative 1 diamond 0 star 5. And once again, we just focus on parentheses, because that's the only thing that's telling us what to start on first. Because we haven't figured out, we haven't defined whether diamond takes precedence over star, or star takes precedence over diamond the way that we have that saying that, hey, you do multiplication before you do addition. We haven't defined it for those operations, but that's what the parentheses helps us do. So we want to evaluate these parentheses first. 0 star 5 that is 0-- because you could view this 0 as the a and the 5 as the b--so it's going to be 0 over 0 plus 5, which is just going to be 0. So this over here, 0 or 5 just goes to 0. So this whole expression simplifies to negative 1 diamond-- this diamond right over here-- diamond 0. And now we go to the definition of the diamond operator. Well, that's five times the first number in our operator, or the first term that we're giving the operator. I guess you could think of it that way. So 5 times that. So it'll be 5 times negative 1, x is negative 1 minus y. Well, y here is the 0. Minus 0. So 5 times negative 1 is negative 5. And you will see-- and the idea here is just to make you feel comfortable defining new operators like this. And not being daunted if all of a sudden you see a diamond, and they're defining the diamond for you. And you're like, wait, I never saw a diamond. They're actually defining it for you, so you shouldn't say, I never saw a diamond. You should say, well, they've defined a diamond for me. This is how I use that operator. And sometimes you'll see even wackier things. You'll see things like this. Let me draw. So they'll define. I don't know if you would even consider this an operator. But you'll see something like this, that by definition, if someone writes a symbol like this, and they put-- a, b, c-- let me write it this way-- a, b, c, d. They'll say this is the same thing as ad minus b, all of that over c. And once again, this is just a definition. They have this weird symbolic way of representing these variables in all this. But they're defining how do you evaluate this crazy expression. And so, if someone were to give you, were to say, evaluate this diamond. Let me evaluate the diamond. So evaluate the diamond where, in my little sections of the diamond, I have a negative 1, a 5, a 3, and a 2. We would just use the definition of how to evaluate this diamond. And we'd say, OK, every time we see an a, that is going to be negative 1. So we have a negative 1 times d. Well, d is whatever is in the bottom right section of this diameter or this kite. So d is going to be 2. Let me write it this way. This is a. This is b. This is c. And this is d. So it's going to be negative 1 times 2 minus b-- well b is 5-- minus 5, all of that over c, which is 3. So this is going to be equal to negative 2 minus 5. So that is negative 7 over 3. And you could go crazy like this. And it might be a fun thing, actually, if you have some spare time. Define your own operators and see how creative you can get with those operators.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-relations-functions
" -  ""Giovanna usually takes bus B to work, ""but now she thinks that bus A gets her to work faster. ""She randomized 50 workdays between a treatment group ""and a control group. ""For each day from the treatment group, she took bus A; ""and for each day from the control group, she took bus B. ""Each day she timed the length of her drive."" This is really interesting what she did, it's very important, she randomized the 50 work days. Before she did this, instead of just kinda waking up in the morning and just deciding on her own which bus to take. Because humans are infamously bad at being random. Even when we think we're being random, we're actually not that random. She might inadvertently be taking bus A earlier in the week. Or maybe the commute times are shorter. Or maybe she inadvertently takes bus A when the weather is better, when there's less traffic. Remember, there's a natural tendency for human beings to want to confirm their hypothesis. So, if she thinks that bus A is faster maybe she'll want to pick the days where she'll get data to confirm her hypothesis. It's really important that she randomize the 50 workdays. What I could imagine she did is maybe she wrote each of the work days, the dates, on a piece of paper. She would have 50 pieces of paper and then she turned them all upside down or maybe she closed her eyes and then she moved them all over her table. Then with her eyes closed she randomly moved them to either the left or the right of the table. If they moved to the left of the table then those are the days she'll take bus A, if she moves them to the right of the table those are the days she takes bus B. That's how she can make sure that this is truly random. So then they tell us, this is important, ""The results of the experiment showed that the median ""travel duration for bus A is eight minutes less than ""the median travel duration for bus B."" Or one way to think about, if we said, ""The treatment group ""median minus the control group median. ""What would we get?"" Well, the treatment group is eight minutes less than the control group? Right? This is A, this is B, so if this is eight less than this, then this is going to be equal to negative eight. This is just another way of restating what I have underlined right over here. Someone's car alarm went off, hope you're not hearing that. Anyway, I'll try to pay attention while it's going off (chuckles). ""To test whether the results could be explained ""by random chance, she created the table below, ""Which summarizes the results of 1000 re-randomizations ""of the data, with differences between medians ""rounded to the nearest five minutes."" What is going on over here? You might say well look, ""She got her result that she ""wanted to get, this data seems to confirm that ""bus A gets her to work faster. ""What's all this other business with re-randomization ""she's doing?"" The important thing to realize is, and she realizes this, is that she might have just gotten this data that I underlined, by random chance. There's some chance maybe A and B are completely similar, in terms of how long they take in reality. She just happened to pick bus A on days where bus A got to work faster. Maybe bus B is faster but she just happened to take bus A on the days that it was faster. The days it just happened to have less traffic. What she's doing here is she re-randomized the data and she wants to see that with all this re-randomized data, out of these 1000 re-randomizations, what fraction of them do I get a result like this? Do I get a result where A is eight minutes or more faster? Or you could say that the median travel duration for bus A is eight minutes less, or even less than that, than the median travel for bus B. So if it was nine minutes less, or 10 minutes less, or 15 minutes less, those are all the interesting ones. Those are the ones that confirm our hypothesis, that bus A gets to work faster. Let's look at this table, it's not below, it's actually to the right. Let's just remind ourselves what she did here, cause the first time you try to process this it can seem a little bit daunting. So, in her experiment, let me write this down, experiment... The car alarm outside which you probably, hopefully are not hearing, it's actually a surprisingly pleasant sounding car alarm, sounds like a slightly obnoxious bird, but anyway (laughs). Her experiment is, the way I described it, 25 days she would take bus A, 25 days she would take bus B. She would record all the travel times and let's say that I have 25 data points in each column. Let's say they get 12 minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, and you just keep going, there's 25 data points. Let's just say that there are 12 data points less than 20 minutes and 12 data points more than 20 minutes. In this circumstance, her median time for bus A would be 20 minutes and I just made this number up. So in order for this to be eight minutes less than the median time for bus B, the median for bus B would have to be 28 and maybe you have data points here. Maybe this is 18 and you have 12 more that are less than 28. Then you have 12 more that are greater than 28. So the median time for bus B would be 28, once again I just made this data up. If you took treatment group median. I 'll just write TGM for short. TGM minus control group median. What do you get? 20 minus 28 is negative eight. This is the actual results of.... These are theoretical, potential results, hypothetical results for her actual experiment. Now what's all of this business over here? What she did is she took these times and she said, ""You know what, let's just imagine a world where I could ""have gotten any of these times randomly on either bus."" So she just randomly re-sorted them between A and B, she did that a thousand times. The first time, the second time, the third time. She does this 1000 times. I'm assuming she used some type of computer program to do it and each time, once again, she just took the data that she had and she just rearranged it, she just reshuffled it. Maybe A on one day. Maybe it got this 18. Maybe it gets the 25. Maybe it gets a 30. Once again, I got the 18, the 25, the 30 and maybe B gets the... You know she's reshuffling all these other data points that I just have with dots and maybe B... Let's see she had the 18, 25, 30, maybe 12, 20, and 28. So in this circumstance, this random reshuffling and she keeps doing it over and over again. In this random reshuffling, the treatment group median minus the control group median is going to be what? It's going to be equal to positive five. In this random shuffling, this hypothetical scenario, Bus A's median would have been five minutes longer than bus B's. If she gets this result with this random re-sorting, this would have been... She would have had a column here for five. Then she would have put one notch right over here. It looks like she classified things or maybe she didn't even get the data but she classified them by multiples of two. If she got this again then she would have put a two here. Then she would have said, ""Okay, in how many of these ""random reshufflings am I getting a scenario where ""there's a five minute difference? ""Or where the treatment group was five minutes longer?"" What is this saying? For example, this is saying that 18 out of the 1000 reshufflings, which she just randomly re-shuffled the data, 18 out of those 1000 times, she found a scenario where her treatment group median was 10 minutes longer than her control group. Where bus A's median was in this hypothetical re-randomization where the treatment group is 10 minutes slower than the control group. There were 159 times where the treatment group... Once again, in her random reshuffling, these aren't based on observations, these are random reshufflings. There's 159 times where her treatment group is four minutes slower than her control group. The whole reason for doing this is she says, ""Okay, what's the probability of getting a result ""like this or better?"" I say, ""better"", as one that even more confirms her hypothesis, that the treatment group is faster than the control group. Well, the scenario, this scenario is this one right over here and then another one that the treatment group is even faster, is this right over here. Here, the treatment group median is 10 less than the control group median. In how many of these scenarios, out of the thousands, is this occurring? Well, this one occurs 85 times, this one occurs eight. If you add these two together, 93 out of the thousand times, out of her re-randomization or I guess you could say 9.3 percent of the time, the data... 9.3 percent of the randomized, the 1000 re-randomizations, 9.3 percent of the time she got data that was as validating of a hypothesis or more than the actual experiment. One way to think about this is, the probability of randomly getting the results from her experiment or better results from her experiment are 9.3 percent. They're low, it's a reasonably low probability that this happened purely by chance. Now, a question is, ""What's the threshold?"" If it was a 50 percent you say, ""Okay, this was very 1""likely to happen by chance."" 1If this was a 25 percent you're like, ""Okay, it's less 1""likely to happen by chance but it could happen."" 19.3 percent, it's roughly 10 percent. 1For every 10 people who do an experiment like she did, 1even if it was random, one person would get data like this? 1What typically happens amongst statisticians is they draw 1a threshold and the threshold for 1statistical significance is usually five percent. 1One way to think about it, the probability of her getting 1this result by chance, 1this result or a more extreme result? 1One that more confirms her hypothesis by chance 1is 9.3 percent. 1If you're cut-off for significance is five percent. 1If you said, ""Okay, this has to be five percent or less."" 1Then you say, ""Okay, this is not statistically significant."" 1There's more than a five percent chance that I could 1have gotten this result purely through random chance. 1Once again, that just depends on where you 1have that threshold. 1When we go back, I think we've already answered 1the final question, ""According to the simulations, 1""what is the probability of the treatment group's median 1""being lower than the control group's median 1""by eight minutes or more?"" 1Which once again, eight minutes or more, that would be 1negative eight and negative 10. 1We just figured that out, that was 93 out of the 1000 1re-randomizations, so it's a 9.3 percent chance. 1If you set five percent as your cut-off for statistical 1significance, you say, ""Okay, this doesn't quite meet my 1""cut-off so maybe this is not a statistically 1""significant result.""",math_statistics-probability_significance-tests-confidence-intervals-two-samples
"  I've been requested to do a video on the cross product, and its special circumstances, because I was at the point on the physics playlist where I had to teach magnetism anyway, so this is as good a time as any to introduce the notion of the cross product. So what's the cross product? Well, we know about vector addition, vector subtraction, but what happens when you multiply vectors? And there's actually two ways to do it: with the dot product or the cross product. And just keep in mind these are-- well, really, every operation we've learned is defined by human beings for some other purpose, and there's nothing different about the cross product. I take the time to say that here because the cross product, at least when I first learned it, seemed a little bit unnatural. Anyway, enough talk. Let me show you what it is. So the cross product of two vectors: Let's say I have vector a cross vector b, and the notation is literally like the times sign that you knew before you started taking algebra and using dots and parentheses, so it's literally just an x. So the cross product of vectors a and b is equal to-- and this is going to seem very bizarre at first, but hopefully, we can get a little bit of a visual feel of what this means. It equals the magnitude of vector a times the magnitude of vector b times the sine of the angle between them, the smallest angle between them. And now, this is the kicker, and this quantity is not going to be just a scalar quantity. It's not just going to have magnitude. It actually has direction, and that direction we specify by the vector n, the unit vector n. We could put a little cap on it to show that it's a unit vector. There are a couple of things that are special about this direction that's specified by n. One, n is perpendicular to both of these vectors. It is orthogonal to both of these vectors, so we'll think about it in a second what that implies about it just visually. And then the other thing is the direction of this vector is defined by the right hand rule, and we'll see that in a second. So let's try to think about this visually. And I have to give you an important caveat: You can only take a cross product when we are dealing in three dimensions. A cross product really has-- maybe you could define a use for it in other dimensions or a way to take a cross product in other dimensions, but it really only has a use in three dimensions, and that's useful, because we live in a three-dimensional world. So let's see. Let's take some cross products. I think when you see it visually, it will make a little bit more sense, especially once you get used to the right hand rule. So let's say that that's vector b. I don't have to draw a straight line, but it doesn't hurt to. I don't have to draw it neatly.  OK, here we go. Let's say that that is vector a, and we want to take the cross product of them. This is vector a. This is b. I'll probably just switch to one color because it's hard to keep switching between them. And then the angle between them is theta. Now, let's say the length of a is-- I don't know, let's say magnitude of a is equal to 5, and let's say that the magnitude of b is equal to 10. It looks about double that. I'm just making up the numbers on the fly. So what's the cross product? Well, the magnitude part is easy. Let's say this angle is equal to 30 degrees. 30 degrees, or if we wanted to write it in radians, I always-- just because we grow up in a world of degrees, I always find it easier to visualize degrees, but we could think about it in terms of radians as well. 30 degrees is-- let's see, there's 3, 6-- it's pi over 6, so we could also write pi over 6 radians. But anyway, this is a 30-degree angle, so what will be a cross b? a cross b is going to equal the magnitude of a for the length of this vector, so it's going to be equal to 5 times the length of this b vector, so times 10, times the sine of the angle between them. And, of course, you could've taken the larger, the obtuse angle. You could have said this was the angle between them, but I said earlier that it was the smaller, the acute, angle between them up to 90 degrees. This is going to be sine of 30 degrees times this vector n. And it's a unit vector, so I'll go over what direction it's actually pointing in a second. Let's just figure out its magnitude. So this is equal to 50, and what's sine of 30 degrees? Sine of 30 degrees is 1/2. You could type it in your calculator if you're not sure. So it's 5 times 10 times 1/2 times the unit vector, so that equals 25 times the unit vector. Now, this is where it gets, depending on your point of view, either interesting or confusing. So what direction is this unit vector pointing in? So what I said earlier is, it's perpendicular to both of these. So how can something be perpendicular to both of these? It seems like I can't draw one. Well, that's because right here, where I drew a and b, I'm operating in two dimensions. But if I have a third dimension, if I could go in or out of my writing pad or, from your point of view, your screen, then I have a vector that is perpendicular to both. So imagine of vector that's-- I wish I could draw it-- that is literally going straight in at this point or straight out at this point. Hopefully, you're seeing it. Let me show you the notation for that. So if I draw a vector like this, if I draw a circle with an x in it like that, that is a vector that's going into the page or into the screen. And if I draw this, that is a vector that's popping out of the screen. And where does that convention come from? It's from an arrowhead, because what does an arrow look like? An arrow, which is our convention for drawing vectors, looks something like this: The tip of an arrow is circular and it comes to a point, so that's the tip, if you look at it head-on, if it was popping out of the video. And what does the tail of an arrow look like? It has fins, right? There would be one fin here and there'd be another fin right there. And so if you took this arrow and you were to go into the page and just see the back of the arrow or the behind of the arrow, it would look like that. So this is a vector that's going into the page and this is a vector that's going out of the page. So we know that n is perpendicular to both a and b, and so the only way you can get a vector that's perpendicular to both of these, it essentially has to be perpendicular, or normal, or orthogonal to the plane that's your computer screen. But how do we know if it's going into the screen or how do we know if it's coming out of the screen, this vector n? And this is where the right hand rule-- I know this is a little bit overwhelming. We'll do a bunch of example problems. But the right hand rule, what you do is you take your right hand-- that's why it's called the right hand rule-- and you take your index finger and you point it in the direction of the first vector in your cross product, and order matters. So let's do that. So you have to take your finger and put it in the direction of the first arrow, which is a, and then you have to take your middle finger and point it in that direction of the second arrow, b. So in this case, your hand would look something like this. I'm going to try to draw it.  This is pushing the abilities of my art skills.  So that's my right hand. My thumb is going to be coming down, right? That is my right hand that I drew. This is my index finger, and I'm pointing it in the direction of a. Maybe it goes a little bit more in this direction, right? Then I put my middle finger, and I kind of make an L with it, or you could kind of say it almost looks like you're shooting a gun. And I point that in the direction of b, and then whichever direction that your thumb faces in, so in this case, your thumb is going into the page, right? Your thumb would be going down if you took your right hand into this configuration. So that tells us that the vector n points into the page. So the vector n has magnitude 25, and it points into the page, so we could draw it like that with an x. If I were to attempt to draw it in three dimensions, it would look something like this. Vector a. Let me see if I can give some perspective.  If this was straight down, if that's vector n, then a could look something like that. Let me draw it in the same color as a. a could look something like that, and then b would look something like that. I'm trying to draw a three-dimensional figure on two dimensions, so it might look a little different, but I think you get the point. Here I drew a and b on the plane. Here I have perspective where I was able to draw n going down. But this is the definition of a cross product. Now, I'm going to leave it there, just because for some reason, YouTube hasn't been letting me go over the limit as much, and I will do another video where I do several problems, and actually, in the process, I'm going to explain a little bit about magnetism. And we'll take the cross product of several things, and hopefully, you'll get a little bit better intuition. See you soon. 1",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-system-of-particles-and-rotational-motion
" In the last video we figured out that if we had a proton coming into the right at a velocity of 6 times 10 to the seventh meters per second. So the magnitude of the velocity is 1/5 the speed of light. And if it were to cross this magnetic field, we used this formula to figure out that the magnitude of the force on this proton would be 4.8 times 10 to the negative 12 newtons. And then the direction, we used our right hand rule because it's a cross product. And we figured out that it would be perpendicular-- well, it has to be perpendicular to both, because we're taking the cross product-- and right when it enters, the net force will be downwards. But then think about what happens. If you have a downward force right there, then the particle will be deflected downward a little bit, so its velocity vector will then look something like that. But it's still in the magnetic field, right? And not only is it still in the magnetic field, but since the particle is still moving within the plane of your video screen, it's still completely perpendicular to the magnetic field. And so the magnitude of the force on the moving particle won't change, just the direction will. Because if we do the right hand rule here, but if we just move our hand down a little bit, if we tilt it down, then our thumb's going to be pointing in this direction. And that just keeps happening. It gets deflected that way a little bit. So the magnitude of the velocity doesn't ever change. It always stays perpendicular to the magnetic field because it's always staying in this plane. But the orientation does change within the plane. And because of that, because the orientation of the velocity changes, the orientation of the force changes. So when the velocity is here, the force is perpendicular. So it acts as kind of a centripetal force, and so the particle will start moving in a circle. So let's see if we can break out our toolkit from what we've learned before in classical mechanics, and figure out what the radius of that circle is. And that might seem more daunting than it really is. Well, what do we know about centripetal forces and radiuses of circles, et cetera? So, what is the formula for centripetal force? And we proved it many, many videos ago, early in the physics playlist. Well, centripetal acceleration is the magnitude of the velocity vector squared over the radius of the circle. And since this is acceleration, if we want to know the centripetal force, it's just the mass times acceleration. So it's the mass of the particle, or the object in question, times the magnitude of its velocity squared divided by the radius of the circle. In this case, this is the radius of the circle. And that's what we're going to try to solve for. And what do we know about the centripetal force? What is causing the centripetal force? Well, it's the magnetic field and we've figured that out. This is going to be equal to this, which we figured out is going to be equal to-- at least the magnitudes-- the magnitude of this is equal to the magnitude of this. And that magnitude is 4.8 times 10 to the minus 12 newtons. And so the radius is going to be-- let's see, if we flip both sides of this equation, we get radius over mass velocity squared is equal to 1 over 4.8 times 10 to the minus 12. I could just figure out what that number is, but I won't worry about that now. Then we can multiply both sides times this mv squared. And we get that the radius of the circle is going to be equal to the mass of the proton times the magnitude of its velocity squared divided by the force from the magnetic field. The centripetal force. 4.8 times 10 to the minus 12 newtons. And the radius should be in meters, since everything is kind of in the standard SI units. And let's see if we can figure this out. Get our calculator. And this is where that constant function is useful again, because what is the mass of a proton? Well, that's something that I personally don't have memorized. But if we go into the built-in constants on the TI-85-- let's see more. Mass of a proton. This is mass of an electron. This is mass of a proton. So mass of a proton-- that's what we care about-- times the magnitude of the velocity squared. What was the velocity? It was 6 times 10 to the seventh meters per second. So times 6 times 10 to the seventh meters per second squared. And all of that divided by the magnitude of the centripetal force. Which is the force that's being generated by the magnetic field. That's 4.8 times 10 to the negative 12. Divided by 4.8 E minus 12. Let's see. Hopefully we don't get something funky. There we go. That's actually a pretty neat number. 1.25 meters. That's actually a number that we can imagine. So if you have a proton going in this direction at 1/5 the speed of light through a-- what'd I say it was? It was a 0.5 tesla magnetic field, where the vectors are pointing out of the video. We have just shown that this proton will go in a circle of radius 1.25 meters. Which is neat because it's a number that I can actually visualize. And so this whole business of magnetic fields making charged particles go into circles, this is one of the few times that I can actually say has a direct application into things that you've seen. Namely, your TV. Or at least the old-school TVs. The non-plasma or LCD TVs, your cathode ray TVs, take advantage of this. Where you essentially have a beam of not protons but electrons. And a magnet-- if you take apart a TV, which I don't think you should do, because you're more likely to hurt yourself because there's a vacuum in there that can implode, and all that-- but essentially, you have a magnet that deflects this electron beam and does it really fast so it scans your entire screen of different intensities, and that's what forms the image. I won't go into that detail. Maybe one day I'll do a whole video on how TVs work. So that's one application of a magnetic field causing a beam of charged particles to curve. And then the other application, and this is actually one where it's actually useful to make the particle go in a circle, is these cyclotrons that you read about, where they take these protons and they make them go in circles really, really fast, and then they smash them together. Well, have you ever wondered, how do they even make a proton go in a circle? It's not like you could hold it and guide it around in a circle. Well, that's what they do. They pass it through an appropriate strength magnetic field, and it curves the path of the proton so that it can keep going through the same field over and over again. And then they can actually use those electric fields. I don't claim to have any expertise in this, but then they can keep speeding it up using the same devices, because it keeps passing through the same part of the collider. And then once it collides, you've probably seen those pictures. You know, that you spend billions of dollars on supercolliders, and you end up with these pictures. And somehow these physicists are able to take these pictures and say, oh, this is some new particle because of the way it moved. Well, what they're actually talking about is these are moving at relativistic speeds. And since they're at relativistic speeds as they move at different velocities, their mass is changing, and all that. But the basic idea is what we just learned. They move in circles. They move in circles because they're going through a magnetic field. But their radiuses are different because their charges and their velocities are going to be different. And actually some will move to the left and some will move to the right. And that might be because they're positive or negative, and then the radius will be dependent on their masses. Anyway, I don't want to confuse you. But I just wanted to show you that we actually are touching on some physics that a physicist would actually care about. Now with that said, what would have happened if this wasn't a proton but if this was an electron moving at this velocity at 6 times 10 to the seventh meters per second through a 0.5 tesla magnetic field popping out of this video. What would have happened? Well, this formula would have still been safe. The magnitude of the force is the charge-- but it wouldn't have been the charge of a proton, it would have been the charge of an electron, times 6 times 10 to the seventh meters per second times 0.5 teslas. So what's the difference between the charge of a proton and the charge of an electron? Well, the charge of an electron is negative. So if this was an electron, then the net force would actually end up being a negative number. So what does that mean? Well, when we used the right hand rule with the proton example, we said that the-- at least when the proton is moving in this direction-- that the net force would be downwards. But now, all of a sudden, if we reverse the charge, if we say we have a negative charge-- the same magnitude but it's negative, because it's an electron-- what happens? The force is now in this direction, using the right hand rule, but it is a negative. So really it's going to be a positive force of the same magnitude in this direction. So if we have a proton, it'll go in a circle in this direction. It'll go like this. But if we have an electron, it'll go in a circle of the other direction. Now let me ask a question. Is that circle going to be a tighter 1circle or a wider circle? 1Well, the mass of an electron is a lot smaller than the mass 1of a proton. 1And we had the radius is equal to the mass times the velocity 1squared divided by the centripetal force. 1So this mass is smaller and the radius 1is going to be smaller. 1So the electron's path would actually move up and it would 1be a smaller radius. 1Actually proportional to the difference in their radiuses 1is the difference in their masses, actually. 1But that would be the path of the electron. 1Anyway, I thought you'd be interested in that, as well. 1I have run out of time. 1I will see you in the next video.",science_physics_magnetic-forces-and-magnetic-fields
" -  As we start to graph lines, we might notice that they're differences between lines. For example, this pink or this magenta line here, it looks steeper than this blue line. And what we'll see is this notion of steepness, how steep a line is, how quickly does it increase or how quickly does it decrease, is a really useful idea in mathematics. So ideally, we'd be able to assign a number to each of these lines or to any lines that describes how steep it is, how quickly does it increase or decrease? So what's a reasonable way to do that? What's a reasonable way to assign a number to these lines that describe their steepness? Well one way to think about it, could say well, how much does a line increase in the vertical direction for a given increase in the horizontal direction? So let's write this down. So let's say if we an increase increase, in vertical, in vertical, for a given increase in horizontal for a given increase a given increase in horizontal. So, how can this give us a value? Well let's look at that magenta line again. Now let's just start at an arbituary point in that magenta line. But I'll start at a point where it's going to be easy for me to figure out what point we're at. So if we were to start right here, and if I were to increase in the horizontal direction by one. So I move one to the right. To get back on the line, how much do I have to increase in the vertical direction? Well I have to increase in the vertical direction by two. By two. So at least for this magenta line, it looks like our increase in vertical is two, whenever we have an increase in one in the horizontal direction. Let's see, does that still work if I were to start here, instead of increasing the horizontal direction by one, if I were increase in the horizontal direction... So let's increase by three. So now, I've gone plus three in the horizontal direction, then to get back on the line, how much do I have to increase in the vertical direction? I have to increase by one, two, three, four, five, six I have to increase by six. So plus six. So when I increase by three in the horizontal direction, I increase by six in the vertical. We were just saying, hey, let's just measure how much to we increase in vertical for a given increase in the horizontal? Well two over one is just two and that's the same thing as six over three. So no matter where I start on this line, no matter where I start on this line, if I take and if I increase in the horizontal direction by a given amount, I'm going to increase twice as much twice as much in the vertical direction. Twice as much in the vertical direction. So this notion of this increase in vertical divided by increase in horizontal, this is what mathematicians use to describe the steepness of lines. And this is called the slope. So this is called the slope of a line. And you're probably familiar with the notion of the word slope being used for a ski slope, and that's because a ski slope has a certain inclination. It could have a steep slope or a shallow slope. So slope is a measure for how steep something is. And the convention is, is we measure the increase in vertical for a given in increase in horizontal. So six two over one is equal to six over three is equal to two, this is equal to the slope of this magenta line. So let me write this down. So this slope right over here, the slope of that line, is going to be equal to two. And one way to interpret that, for whatever amount you increase in the horizontal direction, you're going to increase twice as much in the vertical direction. Now what about this blue line here? What would be the slope of the blue line? Well, let me rewrite another way that you'll typically see the definition of slope. And this is just the convention that mathematicians have defined for slope but it's a valuable one. What is are is our change in vertical for a given change in horizontal? And I'll introduce a new notation for you. So, change in vertical, and in this coordinate, the vertical is our Y coordinate. divided by our change in horizontal. And X is our horizontal coordinate in this coordinate plane right over here. So wait, you said change in but then you drew this triangle. Well this is the Greek letter delta. This is the Greek letter delta. And it's a math symbol used to represent change in. So that's delta, delta. And it literally means, change in Y, change in Y, divided by change in X, change in X. So if we want to find the slope of the blue line, we just have to say, well how much does Y change for a given change in X? So, the slope of the blue line. So let's see, let me do it this way. Let's just start at some point here. And let's say my X changes by two so my delta X is equal to positive two. What's my delta Y going to be? What's going to be my change in Y? Well, if I go by the right by two, to get back on the line, I'll have to increase my Y by two. So my change in Y is also going to be plus two. So the slope of this blue line, the slope of the blue line, which is change in Y over change in X. We just saw that when our change in X is positive two, our change in Y is also positive two. So our slope is two divided by two, which is equal to one. Which tells us however much we increase in X, we're going to increase the same amount in Y. We see that, we increase one in X, we increase one in Y. Increase one in X, increase one in Y. >From any point on the line, that's going to be true. You increase three in X, you're going to increase three in Y. It's actually true the other way. If you decrease one in X, you're going to decrease one in Y. If you decrease two in X, you're going to decrease two in Y. And that makes sense from the math of it as well Because if you're change in X is negative two, that's what we did right over here, our change is X is negative two, we went two back, then your change in Y is going to be negative two as well. Your change in Y is going to be negative two, and negative two divided by negative two, is positive one, which is your slope again.",math_algebra-basics_alg-basics-graphing-lines-and-slope
" -  So what we have depicted in this diagram is the business cycle that we have looked at in other videos. This horizontal axis is time. The vertical axis is real GDP. What we see in this dark blue color, you can view that as full employment output at different points in time, and you can see that it is growing. So this economy is experiencing economic growth. Maybe it's population is increasing, they're getting more productive, maybe with better education or with better technology. But we know that real economies don't just have this nice, clean economic growth. They tend to cycle around their full employment output. There are times when they are above the trend line. Like right over here, you have a positive output gap. So this is a positive output gap at that point right over there. And you could also have negative output gaps. We also talked in other videos about fiscal policy. These are tools that governments might use in order to close these output gaps. For example, when you have a positive output gap, a government might be afraid that things are overheating. Maybe they're afraid of inflation. They might have contractionary fiscal policy. They might try to do something for that moment in time to bring to close that gap a little bit. More likely, when there's a negative output gap and people are out of work, the government will say, ""Hey, let's pass a stimulus package, ""explicitly to try to close this gap. Let's lower taxes. ""Let's increase government spending."" That type of fiscal policy, where the government is doing something special for that circumstance in order to close that output gap, that is discretionary, discretionary fiscal policy. It's at the discretion of the government to do it. What we're going to focus on in this video are automatic stabilizers. These are things that people don't have to take special action based on the circumstances in order for them to help smooth out the business cycle. So automatic stabilizers. So what are examples of automatic stabilizers? So one common one is taxes. So pause this video for a second and think about how do taxes help smooth out these fluctuations? So let's think about what's happening at a part of the business cycle where the economy's expanding, let's say right over there, or let's say right over here. What would be happening with taxes? Well, in these realities, with this positive output gap, you could imagine people's incomes are going to get higher and higher, corporate profits are going to be more and more, and so our change in taxes is going to be positive, and not only is it going to be positive, not only are taxes going to increase in absolute dollar terms, but they're probably gonna grow at a faster rate than the economy. Why is that? When the economy turns positive, when you start expanding more, more and more corporations are going to become profitable. If you think about personal income taxes, below certain incomes in a lot of countries, you don't even have to pay income taxes, and that for every incremental dollar or every incremental $10,000, the tax rate on that incremental chunk could go up. And so that's why the absolute dollar amount of taxes will likely increase at a faster rate than the actual economic growth. And let's think about the other scenario. Let's think about what taxes do when we are in a recession. So let's say we pick that place right over there. Well, in this situation, corporate profits are going to be lower. In fact, some corporations are gonna become unprofitable, in which case they wouldn't pay corporate taxes. People are gonna make less and less money. So your change in taxes here is going to be likely to be negative. And once again, your rate of decrease in taxes is likely to be greater than your rate in decrease of real GDP. The tax multiplier is negative, and so it might smooth out the curve a little bit. Now another example of an automatic stabilizer would be things like welfare payments or unemployment insurance. Why would these be automatic stabilizers? Well, when times are good, when you have this positive output gap, fewer and fewer people are going to need welfare or they're going to need unemployment payments, and so in that world, that is like a decrease in government spending. The government's not going to have to pay for these benefits. And so decrease in government spending, that's contractionary, and so that'll help smooth out the curve a little bit. And once again, when we go into our recession and then when we start having our negative output gaps, more people are going to be on welfare. More people are going to need their unemployment benefits and so that's going to increase government spending, which might, with the multiplier, smooth out this curve a little bit. And so the big takeaway is is when the government does something explicitly for the time that they are in in order to smooth out the curve, that's discretionary fiscal policy. But you might have things in the system, the existing tax policy, existing laws around welfare, or unemployment insurance, or other benefits that might have an effect of, regardless of where we are in the business cycle, they have a dampening effect. They would smooth out these oscillations a little more. They would be automatic stabilizers.",economics-finance-domain_ap-macroeconomics_national-income-and-price-determinations
" Two of the points that define a certain quadrilateral are negative 4 comma negative 2. So let's plot that. So that's negative 4 comma negative 2. And 0 comma 5. So that's 0 comma 5 right over there. The quadrilateral is left unchanged by a reflection over the line y is equal to x over 2. So what does that line look like? y is equal to x over 2. I'll do that in the blue. y is equal to x over 2. So when x is equal to 0, y is 0. The y-intercept is 0 here. And the slope is 1/2. Every time x increases by 1, y will increase by 1/2. Or when x increases by 2, y will increase by 1. So x increases by 2, y increases by 1. X increases by 2, y increases by 1. Or another way to think about it, y is always 1/2 of x. So when x is 4, y is 2. When x is 6, y is 3. When x is 8, y is 4. So we can connect these. Let me try my best attempt to draw these in a relatively straight line. And then I can keep going. When x is negative 2, y is negative 1. When x is negative 4, y is negative 2. So it actually goes through that point right there. And it just keeps going with a slope of 1/2. So this line, and I can draw it a little bit thicker now, now that I've dotted it out. This is the line y is equal to x over 2. And they also say that the quadrilateral is left unchanged by reflection over the line y is equal to negative 2x plus 5. So the y-intercept here is 5. When x is 0, y is 5. So it actually goes through that point. And the slope is negative 2. Every time we increase by 1-- or every time we increase x by 1, we decrease y by 2. So that would go there. We go there. And we keep going at a slope of negative 2. So it's going to look something like this. It actually goes through that point and just keeps going on and on. So this is my best attempt at drawing that line. So that is y is equal to negative 2x plus 5. Now let's think about it. Let's see if we can draw this quadrilateral. So let's first reflect the quadrilateral, or let's reflect the points we have over the line y is equal to x over 2. So this is the line y is equal to x over 2. This magenta point, the point negative 4, 2 is already on that line. So it's its own reflection, I guess you could say. It's on the mirror is one way to think about it. But we can easily reflect at this line over here. This line, if we were to drop a perpendicular-- And actually, this line right over here, y is equal to negative 2x plus 5 is perpendicular to y is equal to x over 2. How do we know? Well if one line has a slope of m, then the line that's perpendicular would be the negative reciprocal of this. It would be negative 1 over m. So this first line has a slope of 1/2. Well what's the negative reciprocal of 1/2? Well the reciprocal of 1/2 is 2/1. and you make that negative. So it is equal to negative 2. So this slope is a negative reciprocal of this slope. So these lines are indeed-- I'm trying to erase that-- perpendicular. So we literally could drop a perpendicular, literally go along this line right over here, in our attempt to reflect. And we see that we're going down 2, over 1 twice. So let's go down 2, over 1, down 2, over 1, twice again. Let me do that in that same color. The reflection of this point, across y is equal to x/2 is this point right over there. So now we have three points of our quadrilateral. Let's see if we can get a fourth. So let's go to the magenta point. The magenta point we've already seen. It's sitting on top of y equals x/2, so trying to reflect it doesn't help us much, but we could try to reflect it across y is equal to negative 2x plus 5. So once again these lines are perpendicular to each other. Actually let me mark that off. These lines are perpendicular. So we can drop a perpendicular and try to find its reflection. So we're going to the right 2 and up 1. We're doing that once, twice, three times on the left side. So let's do that once, twice, three times on the right side. So the reflection is right there. We essentially want to go to that line. And however far we were to the left of it, we want to go that same, that bottom left direction, which you want to go in the same direction, to the top right, the same distance to get the reflection. So there you have it. There is our other point. So now we have the four points of this quadrilateral. Four points of this quadrilateral are-- or the four sides, let me actually just draw the quadrilateral. We have our four points. So this is one side right over here. This is one side, right over here. This is another side, right over here. And you can verify that these are parallel. How would you verify that they're parallel? Well they have the same slope. To get from this point to that point, you have to go over, so your run has to be 4, and you have to rise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So the slope here is 7/4. Rise over run, or change in y over change in x, is 7/4. And over here, you go 1, 2, 3, 4. So you run 4 and then you rise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So the slope here is also 7/4. So these two lines are going to be parallel. And then we could draw these lines over here. So this one at the top. The one at the top right over there. And what's its slope? Well, let's see. We go from x equals 0 to x equals 8. So we go down, our change in y is negative 1 every time we increase x by 8. So this is the slope of-- slope is equal to negative 1/8. And that's the exact same slope that we have right over here. Negative 1/8. So these two lines are parallel as well. This line is parallel to this line as well. So at minimum, we're dealing with a parallelogram. But let's see if we can get even more specific. Because this kind of looks like a rhombus. It looks like a parallelogram, where all four sides have the same length. So there's a couple of ways that you could verify that this parallelogram is a rhombus. One way is you could actually find the distance between the points. We know the coordinates, so you could use the distance formula, which really comes straight out of the Pythagorean theorem. Or even better, you could look at the diagonals of this rhombus-- we could look at the diagonals of this parallelogram. We are trying to figure out if it's a rhombus. And if the diagonals are perpendicular, then you're dealing with a rhombus. And we've already shown that these diagonals, that this diagonal, this diagonal, and this diagonal are perpendicular. They intersect at right angles. And so this must be a rhombus.",math_ab-sixth-grade-math_shape-space
" Welcome to level two linear equations. Let's do a problem. 2x plus 3 is equal to minus 15. Throw the minus in there to make it a little bit tougher. So the first thing we want to do whenever we do any linear equation, is we want to get all of the variable terms on one hand side of the equation and all the constant terms on the other side. And it doesn't really matter, although I tend to get my variables on the left hand side of the equation. Well, my variables are already on the left hand side of the equation but I have this plus 3 that I somehow want to move to the right hand side of the equation. And the way I can-- you can put it in quotes, move the 3 is I can subtract 3 from both sides of this equation. And look at that carefully as to why you think that works. Because if I subtract 3 from the left hand side, clearly this negative 3 that I'm subtracting and the original 3 will cancel out and become 0. and as long as I do whatever I do on the left hand side, as long as I do it on the right hand side as well, because whatever you do on one side of the equal side, you have to do to the other side, then I'm making a valid operation. So this will simplify to 2x, because the 3's cancel out. They become just 0. Equals minus 15 minus 3. Well, that's minus 18. And now, we're just at a level one problem, and you can just multiply both sides of this equation times the reciprocal on the coefficient of 2x. I mean, some people would just say that we're dividing by 2, which is essentially what we're doing. I like to always go with the reciprocal, because if this 2 was a fraction, it's easier to think about it that way. But either way, you either multiply by the reciprocal, or divide by the number. It's the same thing. So 1/2 times 2x. Well, that's just 1x. So you get x equals, and then minus 18/2. And minus 18/2, well, that just equals minus 9. Let's do another problem. And actually, well, if we wanted to check it, we could say, well, the original problem was 2x plus 3 equals minus 15. So we could say 2 times minus 9 plus 3. 2 times minus 9 is minus 18 plus 3. Well, that's equal to minus 15, which is equal to what the original equation said, so we know that's right. That's the neat thing about algebra. You can always check your work. Let's do another problem. I'm going to put some fractions in this time, just to show you that it can get a little bit hairy. So let's say I had minus 1/2x plus 3/4 is equal to 5/6. So we'll do the same thing. First, we just want to get this 3/4 out of the left hand side of the equation, and actually, if you want to try working this out yourself, you might want to pause the video and then play it once you're ready to see how I do it. Anyway, let me move forward assuming you haven't paused it. If we want to get rid of this 3/4, all we do is we subtract 3/4 from both sides of this equation. Minus 3/4. Well, the left hand side, the two 3/4 will just cancel. We get minus 1/2x equals, and then on the right hand side, we just have to do this fraction addition or fraction subtraction. So the least common multiple of 6 and 4 is 12. So this becomes 5/6 6 is 10/12 minus 3/4 is 9/12, so we get minus 1/2x is equal to 1/12. Hopefully, I didn't make a mistake over here. And if that step confused you, I went a little fast, you might just want to review the adding and subtraction of fractions. So going back to where we were. So now all we have to do is, well, the coefficient on the x term is minus 1/2, and this is now a level one problem. So to solve for x, we just multiply both sides by the reciprocal of this minus 1/2x, and that's minus 2/1 times minus 1/2x on that side, and then that's times minus 2/1. The left hand side, and you're used to this by now, simplifies to x. The right hand side becomes minus 2/12, and we could simplify that further to minus 1/6. Well, let's check that just to make sure we got it right. So let's try to remember that minus 1/6. So the original problem was minus 1/2x, so here we can substitute the minus 1/6, plus 3/4. I just wrote only the left hand side of the original problem. So minus 1/2 times minus 1/6, well, that's positive 1/12 plus 3/4. Well, that's the same thing as 12, the 1 stays the same, plus 9. 1 plus 9 is 10 over 12. And that is equal to 5/6, which is what our original problem was. Our original problem was this. This stuff I wrote later. So it's 5/6, so the problem checks out. So hopefully, you're now ready to try some level two problems on your own. I might add some other example problems. But the only extra step here relative to level one problems is you'll have this constant term that you need to add or subtract from both sides of this equation, and you'll essentially turn it into a level one problem.

" In the first video on evolution, I drew something that I called an ape. And then I drew a tail on it. And what I want to do in this video is clarify that that was absolutely wrong. Apes have no tails. And it's actually one of the main distinguishing characteristics of apes. There's obviously other primates that also have no tails. But apes definitely have no tails. And just to clarify, there's kind of two families within apes. And their common names are the lesser apes and the great apes. And the lesser apes are things like gibbons. And the great apes are things like chimpanzees, and gorillas, and me, human beings. So these right here, these are the great apes. And clearly, this great ape right here, did not have a great sense of style in 1994. And really didn't feel the need to have a haircut.",science_biology_her
" Let's see if we can find the cube root of 3,430. And if you're like me, it doesn't jump out of your mind what number times that same number times that same number-- if you have three of those numbers and you were to multiply them together-- would be equal to 3,430. So what I'm going to do is to try to prime factorize this to find all the prime factors of 3,430 and see if any of those prime factors show up at least three times. And that'll help us with this. So 3,430-- it's clearly divisible by 5 and 2, or it's divisible by 10. So let's do that. So first we can divide it by 2. It's 2 times-- let's see. 3,430 divided by 2 is 1,715. Then we can divide it by 5, as well. We can factor 1,715 into 5 and-- let me do a little bit of long division on the side here. So if I have 1,715, and I'm going to divide it by 5. 5 doesn't go into 1. It goes into 17 three times. 3 times 5 is 15. Subtract, you get 2, and then you bring down a 1. 5 goes into 21 four times. 4 times 5 is 20. Subtract. Bring down the 5. 5 goes into 15 three times, so it goes exactly 343 times. So 1,715 can be factored into 5 times 343. Now, 343 might not jump out at you as a number that is easy to factor. It's clearly an odd number, so it won't be divisible by 2. Its digits add up to 10, which is not divisible by 3. So this isn't going to be divisible by 3. It's not going to be divisible by 4, because it's not divisible by 2. It's not going to be divisible by 5. If it wasn't divisible by 3 or 2, it's not going to be divisible by 6. And now we get to 7. Usually when you see a nutty number like this that doesn't seem to be divisible by a lot of things, it's always a good idea to try things like 7, 11, 13. Because those tend to construct very interesting numbers. So let's see if this is divisible by 7. So if I take 343 and if I want to divide it by 7, 7 goes into 30-- it doesn't go into 3-- 7 goes into 34 four times. 4 times 7 is 28. Subtract, 34 minus 28 is 6. Bring down a 3. 7 goes into 63 nine times. 9 times 7 is 63. Subtract. We don't have any remainder. And I forgot to do that last step up here. 3 times 15 is 15. Subtract, no remainder. It went in exactly. So here, 343 can be factored into 7 and 49. And 49 might jump out at you. It can be factored into 7 times 7. So this is interesting. I can rewrite all of this here-- the cube root of 3,430-- now as the cube root of-- I'm just going to write it in its factored form-- 2 times 5 times-- I could write 7 times 7 times 7, or I could write times 7 to the third power. That captures these three 7's right over here. I have three 7's, and then I'm multiplying them together. So that's 7 to the third power. And from our exponent properties, we know that this is the exact same thing as the cube root of 2 times 5 times the cube root-- so let me do that in that same, just so we see what colors we're dealing with. So the cube root of 2 times 5, which is the cube root of 10, times the cube root-- and I think you see where this is going-- of 7 to the third power. Keeping track of the colors is the hard part. And the cube root of 10, we just leave it as 10. We know the prime factorization of 10 is 2 times 5, so you're not going to just get a very simple integer answer here. You would get some decimal answer here, but here you get a very clear integer answer. The cube root of 7 to the third, well, that's just going to be 7. So this is just going to be 7. So our entire thing simplifies. This is equal to 7 times the cube root of 10. And this is about as simplified as we can get just using hand arithmetic. If you want to get the exact number here, you're probably best off using a calculator.",math_pre-algebra_pre-algebra-exponents-radicals
" The perimeter of a rectangular fence measures 0.72 kilometers. The length of the fenced area is 160 meters. What is it's width? Now, the first thing that jumps out at me, and it might have jumped out at you, is that they're giving us different units. They're giving us the perimeter in terms of kilometers, and they're giving us the length in terms of meters. And I'm assuming that they want the width in terms of meters, since that's what they're giving us the length in. So what I want to do right from the get go is just convert the perimeter into meters. So we have the perimeter, and I'll just represent that with a p, is equal to 0.72 kilometers. Which I'll write km for short. Kilometers, 1,000 meters. That's what the prefix kilo- means. And so we can say that for every 1 kilometer we have 1,000 meters. Or we have 1,000 meters per every 1 kilometer. And you might say Sal, how do you know to multiply by 1,000, instead of divide by 1,000? And one way to think about it, and this is probably the best way to think about it, is just look, a kilometer is a bunch of meters. It's actually 1,000 meters. So if I'm converting kilometers into meters, I should have a much larger number. Whatever my number is in kilometers, it must be a much larger number of meters. So that's what tells you to multiply. And also, if you care about dimensional analysis, the dimensions cancel out here too. We have kilometers in the numerator, kilometers in the denominator. And so when you multiply it, you have 0.72 times 1,000 meters. And to multiply anything times 1,000, or really any power of 10, you say, look, if I multiply it by 10, I'll move the decimal to the right one space. That'd be multiplying it by 10, it would be 7.2. Multiplying it by 100 would give us 72. If we're multiplying by 1,000, that would give us 720. And I'll put a trailing 0 here, just so that we have something to move to the right of. So this is going to be equal to 720 meters. So that is the perimeter. Now let's remind ourselves what the perimeter even is. And then hopefully we can figure out the width. So let me draw a little box over here. And they tell us that the length is 160 meters. So let's say that's this dimension right over here. The length is 160 meters. So that would be this dimension and this, it's a rectangle. So these sides are both the same length. And our width is what we need to solve for. So that's our width, and this is also our width. And the perimeter is the measure going around it. So the perimeter is going to be this length, plus this width, plus that same length again, plus that width over there. Or another way to think about it-- and this might be a simpler way-- so there's a couple of ways you could think about it. You could say that the perimeter is equal to the length plus the width, plus the length plus the width. And then we know what the length is. So the perimeter would be equal to 160 meters plus the width. Actually, let me write the units down. 160 meters plus the width, plus 160 meters plus the width. And then we know what know the perimeter is, that's actually 720 meters. So 720 meters is the perimeter. So you would get 720 meters is equal to 160 meters, plus the width, plus 160 meters plus the width. Now there's a bunch of different ways to solve for the width. One way, you could just say, look, if I just have the width plus the length once, that's going to add up to half of the perimeter. So if I just go halfway around the rectangle, that's going to add up to half the perimeter. So if I take my width, which is w, plus my length, which is 160 meters, this should be equal to 1/2 of the perimeter. This should be equal to 1/2 times our perimeter, which is 720 meters. Or you get width plus 160 meters is equal to 1/2 times 720, or 720 divided by 2 is 360 meters. And so now you have a situation where we have the width plus 160 meters is 360 meters. So we could now subtract 360 from both sides. Or sorry, we could subtract 160 from both sides to solve for it. Or you could even do it in your head. If I say something plus 160 is 360, you could, in your head, say well, that something must be 200. 200 plus 160 is 360. So you could just say your width is 200 meters. Or if you want to do it a little bit more formally, you could say look, subtract 160 meters from both sides of this equation. And you are left with the width is equal to 200 meters. So that's one way to do it. We've solved the problem. The other way is, you could actually go straight from this equation. So we get 720. I'm just going to assume everything is in meters. 720. 160 meters plus 160 meters is 320. And that's going to be the same thing as the width plus the width. Or 2 times the width. Anything plus itself is just 2 times that anything. Now if this plus 320 is equal to 720, you could do in your head. You could say well, what plus 320 is 720? Well, this thing must be equal to 400. Or you could do it more formally, and subtract 320 from both sides of this. And you would get-- if you subtract 320 from here-- you would get 400 is equal to, subtract 320 from this side, you get 2 times the width. So if I have 2 times something is equal to 400, that something must be 200. Or if we want to do it more formally, you could divide both sides of this equation by 2. Either way, you will get the width is equal to 200 meters.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-perimeter-and-area-icse
" -  In this video, we're going to talk about what is arguably my favorite enzyme, and that is ATP synthase. And you might be able to predict from its name what it does. It synthesizes ATP. Now you've probably seen it before. We saw it when we looked at respiration, or you will see it when you look at respiration, which is going on in most of the cells of your body. And you also see it when you study photosynthesis. The general thing that it does is, is it sits across a phospholipid membrane. And through other processes, you will have hydrogen ion concentration increase on one side of the membrane, have a higher hydrogen ion concentration on one side than on the other side. You still might have a few over here. And a hydrogen ion is essentially a proton. So on this side of the membrane, it'll be more positive, so there will be a electromotive force to go to the other side. And also, you just have a higher concentration, so there's a chemical gradient, a concentration gradient, where if there was some way for these protons to get to this side, they would want to get there. So there's an electrochemical gradient that they would want to go down. And ATP synthase provides a channel for those protons. But as those protons travel through the ATP synthase, they turn this part of it, which drives this axle, and then this axle nudges these parts of the protein so that they jam together an ADP with a phosphate group to produce ATP. So down here, you, going into this part of the complex, you'll have an ADP and a phosphate group. And then that rotation force that's provided by that electrochemical gradient, that then produces our ATP. And that's going to be the case both in respiration, which occurs in the mitochondria, and in photosynthesis, which occur in chloroplasts. Now there's a few differences. In mitochondria, the hydrogen ions, these protons, the concentration builds up in the intermembrane space right over here because of the electron transport chain. And we studied that in other videos. And then the protons travel through the ATP synthase. You could see a little mini version right over here. You could imagine that what we see really big, that is a blown-up version of this part of the mitochondria, and this is, of course, is not to scale. So in the case of a mitochondria, this would be the inner membrane. Right over here would be the intermembrane space between the inner and the outer membrane, intermembrane space. And right over here would be the matrix of the mitochondria. And so as the protons go through, they're able to produce ATP in the matrix. Now in chloroplasts, the hydrogen protons build up inside the thylakoids, which are these parts of the chloroplast. That space inside the thylakoid is often called the thylakoid space, sometimes called the lumen. That proton buildup inside the thylakoids happens because of the light reactions, the first phase of photosynthesis. But then those protons will travel through the thylakoid membrane, through to this area, which is known as the stroma in chloroplasts, and they produce the ATP in the stroma. But then the ATP is used in the second phase of photosynthesis to synthesize carbohydrates, which is, you could view as one of the end products of photosynthesis. So the big takeaway of this video is, one, ATP synthase is incredibly cool. If you look up on the internet, you can find some simulations that show ATP synthase and how it acts like a motor to jam the phosphate group to the ADP to produce ATP. And ATP synthase in mitochondria and chloroplasts are remarkably similar, although they sit in different parts of these organelles. And the ATP in mitochondria, you can view as the end product of respiration, while the ATP produced in chloroplasts is an intermediary store of energy, which is then used to synthesize carbohydrates.",science_ap-biology_cellular-energetics
"  Next time you're with a group of friends, and you have to go pee, be a little fancy. Stand up and announce to them that I must now undergo micturition. Micturition, which is a fancy phrase for ""to pee,"" or ""to urinate."" And so in this video we're gonna talk about the process of micturition. Beginning where we left off in the kidney, after we concentrate urine in our nephrons, we have this part that sort of touches the tip of the renal medulla, that's our renal calyx. Our renal calyx will be the part to first collect urine from the collecting tubules, and we said several renal calyces coalesce together into the renal pelvis, so that's the renal pelvis right there, and then the renal pelvis itself leaves the kidney through this tube called the ureter, and we've got two ureters right there. The ureter then conducts our urine inferiorly, or towards our feet, by connecting into the bladder. And note that these dotted lines imply that the ureter's attached to the back, or the posterior aspect of the bladder. So our ureters are like a one-way street, because they have valves that prevent backflow of urine upwards. That means that the urine will only flow down towards your feet, but there are certainly some exceptions to this, which I encourage you then to think about what can happen. What could happen if you allow urine to sort of flow backwards instead of in one direction towards the loo, or the toilet, and we'll talk about that in a minute, but for now, from our ureter our urine makes it into the bladder that I've drawn right here, and you can see it from the front like this, but it may be useful to take a look at it from the side. So if I say this is the top, and then the bottom is over here, and our anterior side, or the front on this side, and our posterior aspect, or the back on this side, our bladder would look like this. We'd have this top right here, and then kind of spin down, like so, and this front part right here would be kind of pointy, and so this comes down and collects here. And don't forget that our ureters conduct urine to the back right there, so we can draw two of them, these guys right there, and this is our posterior aspect, and the fancy thing about our bladder is that it's lined with something that's called transitional epithelium, which is something like what you've heard of before. You may have heard of squamous epithelium, which is just flat epithelial cells, or columnar epithelium, which are taller cells. Transitional just means they're somewhere in between. And the reason why we do this, is because it allows the bladder to expand. Remember, the bladder is going to be filling up with urine, and holding onto it, until we're at an appropriate place to go to the bathroom. So until then, our transitional epithelium allows our bladder to fill up and hold about 300 to 500 milliliters of urine, which is about the volume of a tall bottle of water. This then leads to a structure down here, and I'll draw going that-a-way, and I'll draw it here as well. That goes straight into the loo. This final part of our urinary tract is called the urethra. And we don't just have urine leak from the bladder and go straight into the urethra. There's some control here at the neck of the bladder. Right about there, we have what's called the internal, because it's deep inside us, the internal urethral, because it surrounds the urethra, sphincter. That's the internal urethral sphincter, and it's just a circle of muscle, that is not under our control, but it makes sure that the bladder keeps urine within it, and doesn't leak out urine, unless it's really full. And so we don't have control over the internal urethral sphincter. So if you were to guess what type of muscle this is, I'm sure you'd say, this certainly is going to be smooth muscle, because it's involuntarily controlled. And just for reference, that sits about right there. So that's going to be our internal urethral sphincter. So now that we've covered the bladder, I think this would be a good opportunity to take a look at a video, within this video, that shows how the ureters spray urine into the bladder. We call this a ureter jet, and sometimes you can see this on ultrasound, like here. I've oriented the ultrasound like this, so you can kind of take a look at the top, and the bottom of the bladder, but some of the rest of this image may be a little different, but just focus on the bladder for right now, and let's play this video. Oh, and I should mention that this thing right here tells you how much flow that you have, so notice whenever you see anything in yellow or orange, that just means that's urine that's being ejected into the bladder. So as I press play, notice that we have one stream that fires in, that's one ureter. And then when that stops, we're very lucky to see another ureter right there fire some urine into our bladder. I got this video from one of my mentors. Dr. John Fox was very nice to lend me this. Going back to the cartoon world that we have here, we can focus on what happens once urine leaves the bladder and goes into the urethra. The urethra will conduct urine to the outside world, and that's the organ that we use to pee away our urine, but the path from the bladder to the bathroom is very different if we're talking about men versus women. So I've got this female bladder right here, that's going to lead into a female urethra, that we're going to talk about, and I'm gonna contrast that with the male urethra. Now to be complete, the female urethra has sort of the same set-up as the male urethra. It leads out of the body, and has its own internal urethral sphincter right up there. And then there's a part of the urethra that happens afterwards right here that's called the membranous urethra, so membranous because we pass though a membrane, or a sheet that circles the urethra, and so we already talked about something that circles the urethra already, and that's kind of right above the structure I'm drawing in right now. We had the internal urethral sphincter that was circling our urethra at the neck of the bladder. Down here, this membrane, or this sheet that we have sort of circling our urethra is the external urethral sphincter. And because it's external, and it's something that WE control, this is going to be made up of skeletal muscle. And this is what we learn to control through potty training. Now to contrast that with the male situation, we don't go directly into the membranous urethra. No, instead we have a portion that's called the prostatic urethra, because we pass through an organ called the prostate. It's not directly involved in the urinary system, but it circumscribes the urethra right there. After the prostatic urethra, then we have the membranous urethra. So that's the part that's the same as what we've got in women. So we have our membranous urethra, and of course, in dudes, we've also got this sheet, or this muscle that's surrounding our urethra here, that's our external urethral sphincter that's under voluntary control because it's skeletal muscle, and then from there, we lead into what's called the spongy urethra. The spongy urethra is just the part of the urethra that's in the penis. So that's in the penis, and then afterwards, the urine leaves the body, and it's out in the external world. This entire system right here is in contact with the external environment. Now as you may have guessed, women don't have a spongy urethra. So what happens after the membranous urethra is actually kind of short-lived. This is actually going to be pretty short in comparison to the male urethra, so the connection to the outside world is a little more direct in females than it is in men. Now this kind of goes back to that comment I made earlier about backflow. We make sure that our valves here in the ureter makes urine go in one direction, to the bladder, and then we're gonna go out this way. But if we don't have valves, and we do have backflow, we can end up having what's called stasis, or urine just kind of hanging out up here, or maybe up in the kidney for a long period of time. Now that can be problematic, especially because we're in contact with the external environment, and you know that there are things like bacteria, and viruses, and fungi that can cause an infection. So if we have stasis right here, I'll just write a little telephone pole right there, stasis right there, we may have a greater risk of infection, because one of the functions of urinating is also to dispel bacteria that may have made it up the urethra from contact with the external environment. So we have a greater risk of infection if we have backflow, and we have a greater risk of infection if we have a shorter urethra, which is what happens in females. And that's the whole reason why women tend to have more urinary tract infections, so I'll write that down, that's a urinary tract infection, a UTI. They happen more so in women than they do in men because women have a shorter urethra. Either way, the urine makes it out of the body, goes into the loo, and effectively discards the waste products that we've made in our body, that we've filtered and concentrated in our kidneys.",science_high-school-biology_hs-human-body-systems
" -  We've already spent a couple of videos talking about enzymes, and what I want to do in this video is dig a little bit deeper and focus on some actors that actually help enzymes. And just as a reminder, enzymes are around to help reactions to proceed, to lower their activation energies, to make the reactions happen more frequently or to happen faster. Now, we've already seen examples of enzymes, and just to frame things in our brain properly, sometimes in a textbook you'll see an enzyme like this, you'll see a drawing like this. And people will call this the enzyme, they'll call this the enzyme, and then they'll call this right, they'll say okay, and it's acting on some kind of a substrate right over here, it's going to do something to that. And this is nice for a very abstract, textbook idea of a substrate locking into an enzyme like this, but this isn't actually what it looks like in a biological system. We have to remind ourselves, when people talk about enzymes they're talking about proteins. Now there are these kind of RNA enzymes called ribozymes but the great majority, when we're talking about enzymes, we tend to be talking about proteins. And we spent a lot of time talking about how proteins are these structures, there's polypeptides, and all the side chains of the various amino acids fold the proteins in all sorts of different ways. So a better drawing for something like this would be this protein that's all folded in different ways, maybe has some alpha helices here, maybe it has some beta sheets right over here. It's all this kinda crazy stuff right over there. And then the substrate might be some type of a molecule, that is it gets embedded in the protein. And you see some examples right over here. This is actually a hexokinase model and you see, at least you can see a little bit of the ATP right over there, and it's a little harder to see the glucose that's going to be phosphorylated. And this reaction is being facilitated by this big protein structure, the hexokinase. Now, what we're going to focus on in this video is that, when we talk about an enzyme, and we're talking about proteins, we're talking about a chain of amino acids, but there's often other parts of the enzyme that aren't officially proteins. And we even saw that when we talked about hexokinases, when we talked about the phosphorylation of glucose, we said hey, the way that it lowers the activation energy is you have these positive magnesium ions, these positive magnesium ions, that can keep the electrons in the phosphate groups a little bit busy, draw them away, so that this hydroxyl group right over here can bond with this phosphate and not be interfered with these electrons. Well these magnesium ions right over here, they aren't officially part of the protein. These are what we call cofactors. So you might have a cofactor right over there that latches onto the broader protein to become part of the enzyme, and you actually need that for the reaction to proceed, it plays a crucial role here. So another drawing in the textbook, you'll see something like this, or even, they'll draw, they'll say okay, in order for this reaction to proceed, yes, you need the substrate, but you also need the cofactor. The cofactor. And once again, it sounds like a fancy word, but all it means is a non-protein part of an enzyme. It's another molecule or ion or atom that is involved in letting the enzyme perform its function that it's not formally a part of an amino acid or part of a side chain or part of the protein, but it's another thing that needs to be there to help catalyze the reaction. We saw that with hexokinase, you had magnesium ions that the complex picks up. And this is why, when people talk about your vitamins and minerals, a lot of the vitamins and minerals that you need, they actually act as cofactors for enzymes. And so you could even see it in this drawing over here, at least based on what I read these are the magnesium ions in green right over here, and these are cofactors. These are cofactors. So cofactor, non-protein part of your actual enzyme. Now, we can subdivide cofactors even more. We can divide them into organic cofactors and inorganic cofactors. So if you have cofactors, we've seen an inorganic cofactor, a lot of these ions, you'll see magnesium ions, you'll see sodium ions, you'll see calcium ions, you'll see all sorts of things acting as cofactors, often times to distract electrons, or to keep them busy so that electrons can proceed. But you can also have organic ones, you can also have organic molecules. Remember, organic molecules, these are just, they'll involve carbon, they have chains of carbons and other things. And cofactors that are organic molecules, we call them coenzymes. Coenzymes. And there's a bunch of examples of coenzymes. This right over here is the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and it has a coenzyme, and this coenzyme you are going to see a lot in your biological careers, NAD, right over here. Notice, this isn't just an ion, it is an entire molecule. It has carbon in it, that's why we call it organic. And it is not formally protein, it's not part of the amino acids that make up the protein, so that's what makes it a cofactor, and since it's an entire organic molecule, we call this a coenzyme. Coenzyme. But like any cofactor, it plays a role in actually allowing the enzyme to do its function, to facilitate a reaction. And this particular coenzyme, NAD, which you're going to see a lot, it helps facilitate the transfer of hydride ions. Hydride ions never, or very seldom, exist by themselves, but it's a hydrogen with an extra electron, so it has a negative charge. So it allows the transfer of this group from a substrate or to a substrate, and that's because NAD can accept a hydride anion right over here and become NADH. And if you want to see its broader structure, it's actually quite fascinating. I'll probably do a whole video on NAD because in so many textbooks growing up I just saw NAD and NADH and I'm like what is this thing? And it's a fascinating molecule. So what it can do is it can actually pick up the hydride anion right over here at this carbon, you can actually form another bond with the hydrogen, and I'll do that in a future video, I'll show the mechanism for it. But it's a pretty cool molecule and I like to actually look at this molecule and remember, the whole focus of this is coenzymes, but we see these patterns throughout biology because the name, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exactly describes what it is. Nicotinamide, right down here, that is this piece of the molecule, and this is the part that can accept a hydride or let go of a hydride, so you could say this is the active part of the molecule. Adenine, our good old friend, we've seen adenine in DNA, in RNA, in ATP, so this is our good old friend adenine, right over here. And it says dinucleotide, cause we actually have two nucleotides paired together, their phosphate groups are tied together. And there's a couple cool ways to think about this. You have an adenine right over here, you have a ribose, you have a phosphate group. If you just looked at this piece, right over here, if you looked at this right over here, this is your building block, or this could be a building block, of RNA, if you have an adenine right over there. And if you include, let me undo this, if you include all of this, this right over here, this is ADP, well the reason why it's called dinucleotide is you can also divide it the other way. You can say, alright you have one nucleotide that has nicotinamide right over here, so that's one of the nucleotides, and then the other nucleotide is right over here, the one that involves adenine, that's why it's called dinucleotide. So hopefully this makes NAD less of a mysterious molecule, we'll see it in the future, but I like to look at it because it's got all these patterns, it's got all these components that you see over and over again, and you see it in ATP, you see it in RNA, over and over again. But this isn't the only cofactor or coenzyme. There are many many others, in fact when people say take your vitamins and your minerals, that tends to be because they are cofactors. Vitamin C is a very important cofactor to be involved in enzymes that, well I won't go into all of the different things that it can do. These are two different views of vitamin C, a space-filling model and this is a ball-and-stick model right over here of vitamin C. Folic acid, once again, two different views, but these are all coenzymes, they all work, you know if you have a protein right over here that you know it's all this really complex structure, maybe you have some substrates, but to help facilitate, let me do the substrates in a different color, so maybe you have some substrates, so these are the things that the enzyme is trying to catalyze the reactions for. But then you could have some ions, which would, you know, you could kind of view these as you would view these, you would view the ions as cofactors, and you could have organic cofactors, like the vitamin C, or other things that we talked about that are also involved and help facilitating the mechanism, or help facilitate the reaction. And once again, sometimes it might be to help stabilize some charge, sometimes it might be to be an electron acceptor or donor, or a whole series of different things. They can actually act as part of the reaction mechanism.",science_biology_energy-and-enzymes
" After coursing throughout the blood vessels of our bodies, a hormone eventually meets a receptor that was created specifically for it by the target cells that it was sent to stimulate. And the way that hormone interacts with the receptor happens in one of two very characteristic ways. And I want to show you today how that happens. And so the first major mechanism of hormone action at the cell that I'm going to start with is by secondary messengers. And I'm going to start with secondary messengers because, historically, they're a little bit more confusing. But essentially what's happening is a hormone is binding to a receptor on a cell. So let me draw a cell and its receptor. And I'll draw a hormone binding to it. But the process of that binding, instead of just stimulating the effect, it really sets off this chain reaction that leads to secondary messengers inside the cell being released. So let me draw those. And you've got these secondary messengers being released, and these are actually what's stimulating whatever effect is desired, whether that may be insulin being released or glucose being taken up inside the cell, or any of the other countless things taking place in our bodies that are controlled by hormones. And so in order to give you a visual for how this might take place in the cell, I've pre-drawn some pictures in the key. So let me pull those in here. And I want you to be sure that these drawings are not to scale in any way. But really, this is the best I can at least do in explaining the process, because all of this is happening at the atomic level, and atoms are really tiny. But anyway, what we have in this picture is a receptor. And I've drawn that in pink, and it's located inside the cell membrane. So this is the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane, and we've got the inside of the cell, and the outside. And then also in the cell membrane, we've got a G protein, and I've drawn that in green. It's called a G protein because it binds to molecules that include the nucleotide guanine. And that's the same G from the DNA bases that you might be a little bit more familiar with. But it's currently bound to a molecule called guanine diphosphate. And then we'll see how that changes. But we also have this adenylate cyclase enzyme that's in the cell membrane. And remember that an enzyme speeds up reaction. So we're going to see how adenlyate cyclase speeds up a reaction. But what starts this process off is the hormone is going to bind to the receptor. So it's going to look like that. And you're going to have the hormone bound to the receptor. And once that hormone binds to the receptor, it's going to change shape. And that's going to allow it to interact with the G protein here. And so that looks like this. And what you saw happen was that as the G protein interacts with the receptor in a hormone complex, it's going to exchange that GDP that it started with, that guanine diphosphate for GTP. So essentially, it's exchanging a guanine bound to two phosphates for a guanine bound to three phosphates. And what happens is that enables the G protein to move through the cell membrane and interact with adenylate cyclase. And so that activates the adenylate cyclase. And as an enzyme, that activated adenylate cyclase facilitates the conversion of ATP, which is the energy currency of the cell, into cAMP. And cAMP stands for cyclic adenosine monophosphate. So we've taken this ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, and created a cyclic adenosine monophosphate. And we also have the additional two phosphates. But it is this cAMP molecule that activates the protein inside the cell whose effect is really being targeted by the hormone in the first place. And so eventually, this system resets, but not before several adenlyate cyclase enzymes were activated, resulting in a lot of cAMP being produced. And so we call this signal amplification. And what I mean by signal amplification is that, in theory, one hormone can bind to a receptor. And that process can set off a chain reaction that leads to a lot of cAMP being produced. And so it can mean that less hormone is required to ultimately activate the protein or the effect that's being desired. And so secondary messengers are a means in which hormones act on the cell. But really, if I'm being honest, this effect happens differently for a lot of cells. And all of the mechanisms of secondary messenger hormone action aren't known right now. And honestly, there are a lot of secondary messengers other than cAMP. But really, the takeaway is that for the majority of the hormones in your body, binding to the cell surface activates a series of reactions that initiate a response inside the cell. And so it's very similar to the use of a phone service provider. And because we as people-- let me draw us-- because we're unable to communicate directly with people sometimes, because of separation or convenience or lack of efficiency, we use a phone service to project our voice to them through a phone conversation. So through a phone conversation, we'll direct our voice to people that we want to communicate with. Or maybe we use the delivery of a text message. A text message will transmit some intended message that we have for people that we can't communicate directly with, for whatever reason. And so that's very similar to how secondary messengers assist hormones that can't communicate with a receptor directly inside of the cell. And so peptide hormones and catecholamines, both of which can't cross the cell membrane, use secondary messengers to communicate. And then the other major method of hormone action on a cell is as a primary messenger. Certain hormones, like steroids and thyroid hormones, can actually cross the cell membrane. And it eliminates this entire middleman system that we set up before. So let me pull in another cell membrane. And so the hormone crosses the cell membrane and it binds to a receptor that's located either in the cytosol or in the nucleus. And so we could imagine a nucleus, and there might be DNA inside. But when the hormone binds to the receptor that's either in the cytoplasm or inside the nucleus, that binding process is going to directly affect transcription in the nucleus, or translation in the cytoplasm, of the protein that's being activated by the hormone. And this process has quite a few less moving parts than the secondary messenger system did. But again, it stems back to the fact that these are steroid and thyroid hormones that are typically lipid-based and are capable of crossing through the cell membrane on their own. And so they don't need all of that extra machinery set up for them. But anyway, these are both primary messengers and secondary messengers. And those are the two main processes by which hormones act on the cell that they're created to target.",science_health-and-medicine_advanced-endocrine-system
" -  What I wanna do in this video is compare the fractions 3/4 and 4/5, and I wanna do this visually. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have two copies of the same whole, so let me just draw that, but I'm gonna divide the first one, so this is one whole right over here, this rectangle, when we draw the whole thing. So this is a whole, and right below that, we have the same whole. We have a rectangle of exactly the same size. Now you might notice that I've divided them into a different number of equal sections. In the top one, I've divided it into four equal sections because I am concerned with fourths so I've divided this top whole into fourths and I've divided this bottom whole, or this bottom bar or this bottom rectangle, into fifths, or five equal sections. So let's think about what 3/4 represent. So that's gonna be one of the fourths, right over here, two of the fourths, and then three of the fourths. And what is 4/5 going to be? Well, 4/5 is going to be one fifth, two fifths, three fifths, and four fifths. So when you look at them visually, remember, we're taking fractions of the same whole. This is 3/4 of that rectangle, this is 4/5 of a same-sized rectangle. It wouldn't make any sense if you're doing it for different shapes or different sized rectangles. We just divided them into different sections and you see that if you have four of the fifths, that that is going to be more than three of the fourths, and so 4/5 is greater than 3/4 or you could say 3/4 is less than 4/5, or any way you wanna think about it. The symbol you wanna use always opens to the larger number. 4/5 is larger than 3/4, so the large end of our symbol is facing the 4/5, so we would say 3/4 is less than 4/5.",math_4th-engage-ny_engage-4th-module-5
" -  Someone walks up to you on the street and says, ""2943, quick is this divisible by nine? It's a matter of life and death"", and you could say, ""Well, I can do this fairly quickly"". To figure out whether it's divisible by nine, I just have to add up the digits and figure out if the sum of the digits is a multiple of nine or whether it's divisible by nine. So let's do that. Two plus nine plus four plus three, two plus nine is 11, 11 plus four is 15, 15 plus three is 18, and 18 is definitely divisible by nine, so this is going to be divisible by nine. And even if you are unsure of whether 18 is divisible by nine you could apply the same rule again. One plus eight is equal to nine, so that's definitely, definitely divisible by nine. And so the person can go save their lives or whoever's life they were trying to save with that information. But this might leave you thinking, well, that was nice and useful, but why did that work? Does this work for all numbers? Does it only work for nine? and I don't think this works for eight, or seven, or 11, or 17, why does it work for nine? And actually also works for three, and we'll think about that in the future video. And to realize that, we just have to rewrite 2943. So the two in 2943, it's in the thousands place, so we can literally rewrite it as two times, two times 1000, the nine is in the hundreds place, so we can literally write it as nine times 100, the four is in the tens place, so it's literally the same thing as four times 10, and then finally we have our three in the ones place, we could write it as three times one or just three. This is literally 2000, 900, 40, and three, 2943. But now we can rewrite each of these things, this thousand, this hundred, this ten, as a sum of one plus something that is divisible by nine, so 1000, 1000 I can rewrite as one plus 999, one plus 999, I can rewrite 100 as one plus 99, one plus 99, I can rewrite 10 as one plus 9, and so two times 1000 is the same thing as two times one plus 999, nine times 100 is the same thing as nine times one plus 99, four times 10 is the same thing as four times one plus nine, and then I have this plus three over here. But now I can distribute, I can say, well, this over here is the same thing as two times one, which is just two, plus two times 999, this thing right over here is the same thing as nine times one, just to be clear what I'm doing, I'm distributing the two over the first parenthesis, these first two terms, then the nine, I'm gonna distribute again, so it's gonna be nine, nine times one plus nine times 99, plus nine times 99, and then over here, I forgot the plus sign right over here, I'm gonna distribute the four, four times one, so plus four, and then four times nine, so plus four times nine, and then finally I have this positive three, or plus three right over here. Now I'm just gonna rearrange this addition, so I'm gonna take all the terms we're multiplying by 999, and I'm going to do that in orange. So I'm gonna take this term, this term, and this term right over here, and so I have two times 999, that's that there, plus nine times 99, plus four times nine, plus four times nine, so that's those three terms, and then I have plus two, plus two, plus nine, plus nine, plus four, plus four, and plus three, plus three. And this is interesting, this is just the sum of our digits, this is just what we did up here, and you might see where all of this is going, this orange stuff here, is this divisible by nine? What? Sure, it will definitely, 999, that's divisible by nine, so anything this is multiplying by, it's divisible by nine, so this is divisible by nine, this is definitely divisible by nine, 99, regardless of whether is being multiplied by nine, whatever is multiplying by nine, whatever is multiplying 99 is gonna be divisible by nine, because 99 is divisible by nine, so this works out, and same thing over here, you're always going to be multiplying by a multiple of nine, so all of this business all over here is definitely going to be divisible by nine. And so in order for the whole thing, and all I did is I rewrote 2943 like this right over here, in order for the whole thing to be divisible by nine, this part definitely is divisible by nine, in order for the whole thing does the rest of this sum, it has to be divisible by nine as well. So in order for this whole thing, all of this has to be divisible, divisible by nine.",math_pre-algebra_pre-algebra-factors-multiples
" In the last video, we showed that any external pressure on a liquid in a container is distributed evenly through the liquid. But that only applied to-- and that was called Pascal's principle-- external pressure. Let's think a little bit about what the internal pressure is within a liquid. We're all familiar, I think, with the notion of the deeper you go into a fluid or the deeper you dive into the ocean, the higher the pressure is on you. Let's see if we can think about that a little bit more analytically, and get a framework for what the pressure is at any depth under the water, or really in any fluid. Here I've drawn a cylinder, and in that cylinder I have some fluid-- let's not assume that it's water, but some fluid, and that's the blue stuff. I'm also assuming that I'm doing this on a planet that has the same mass as Earth, but it has no atmosphere, so there's a vacuum up here-- there's no air. We'll see later that the atmosphere actually adds pressure on top of this. Let's assume that there's no air, but it's on a planet of the same mass, so the gravity is the same. There is gravity, so the liquid will fill this container on the bottom part of it. Also, the gravitational constant would be the same as Earth, so we can imagine this is a horrible situation where Earth has lost its magnetic field and the solar winds have gotten rid of Earth's atmosphere. That's very negative, so we won't think about that, but anyway-- let's go back to the problem. Let's say within this cylinder, I have a thin piece of foil or something that takes up the entire cross-sectional area of the cylinder. I did that just because I want that to be an indicator of whether the fluid is moving up or down or not. Let's say I have that in the fluid at some depth, h, and since the fluid is completely static-- nothing's moving-- that object that's floating right at that level, at a depth of h, will also be static. In order for something to be static, where it's not moving-- what do we know about it? We know that the net forces on it must be zero-- in fact, that tells that it's not accelerating. Obviously, if something's not moving, it has a velocity of zero, and that's a constant velocity-- it's not accelerating in any direction, and so its net forces must be zero. This force down must be equal to the force up. So what is the force down acting on this cylinder? It's going to be the weight of the water above it, because we're in a gravitational environment, and so this water has some mass. Whatever that mass is, times the gravitational constant, will equal the force down. Let's figure out what that is. The force down, which is the same thing is the force up, is going to equal the mass of this water, times the gravitational constant. Actually, I shouldn't say water-- let me change this, because I said that this is going to be some random liquid, and the mass is a liquid. The force down is going to be equal to the mass of the liquid times gravity. What is that mass of the liquid? Well, now I'll introduce you to a concept called density, and I think you understand what density is-- it's how much there is of something in a given amount of volume, or how much mass per volume. That's the definition of density. The letter people use for density is rho-- let me do that in a different color down here. rho, which looks like a p to me, equals mass per volume, and that's the density. The units are kilograms per meter cubed-- that is density. I think you might have an intuition that if I have a cubic meter of lead-- lead is more dense than marshmallows. Because of that, if I have a cubic meter of lead, it will have a lot more mass, and in a gravitational field, weigh a lot more than a cubic meter of marshmallows. Of course, there's always that trick people say, what weighs more-- a pound of feathers, or a pound of lead? Those, obviously, weigh the same-- the key is the volume. A cubic meter of lead is going to weigh a lot more than a cubic meter of feathers. Making sure that we now know what the density is, let's go back to what we were doing before. We said that the downward force is equal to the mass of the liquid times the gravitational force, and so what is the mass of the liquid? We could use this formula right here-- density is equal to mass times volume, so we could also say that mass is equal to density times volume. I just multiply both sides of this equation times volume. In this situation, force down is equal to-- let's substitute this with this. The mass of the liquid is equal to the density of the liquid times the volume of the liquid-- I could get rid of these l's-- times gravity. What's the volume of the liquid? The volume of the liquid is going to be the cross-sectional area of the cylinder times the height. So let's call this cross-sectional area A. A for area-- that's the area of the cylinder or the foil that's floating within the water. We could write down that the downward force is equal to the density of the fluid-- I'll stop writing the l or f, or whatever I was doing there-- times the volume of the liquid. The volume of the liquid is just the height times the area of the liquid. So that is just times the height times the area and then times gravity. We've now figured out if we knew the density, this height, the cross-sectional area, and the gravitational constant, we would know the force coming down. That's kind of vaguely interesting, but let's try to figure out what the pressure is, because that's what started this whole discussion. What is the pressure when you go to deep parts of the ocean? This is the force-- what is the pressure on this foil that I have floating? It's the force divided by the area of pressure on this foil. So I would take the force and divide it by the area, which is the same thing as A, so let's do that. Let's divide both sides of this equation by area, so the pressure coming down-- so that's P sub d. The downward pressure at that point is going to be equal to-- keep in mind, that's going to be the same thing as the upward pressure, because the upward force is the same. The area of whether you're going upwards or downwards is going to be the same thing. The downward pressure is going to be equal to the downward force divided by area, which is going to be equal to this expression divided by area. Essentially, we can just get rid of the area here, so it equals PhAg divided by A-- we get rid of the A's in both situations-- so the downward pressure is equal to the density of the fluid, times the depth of the fluid, or the height of the fluid above it, times the gravitational constant Phg. As I said, the downward pressure is equal to the upward pressure-- how do we know that? Because we knew that the upward force is the same as the downward force. If the upward force were less, this little piece of foil would actually accelerate downwards. The fact that it's static-- it's in one place-- lets us know that the upward force is equal to the downward force, so the upward pressure is equal to the downward pressure. Let's use that in an example. If I were on the same planet, and this is water, and so the density of water-- and this is something good to memorize-- is 1,000 kilograms per meter cubed. Let's say that we have no atmosphere, but I were to go 10 meters under the water-- roughly 30 feet under the water. What would be the pressure on me? My pressure would be the density of water, which is 1,000 kilograms per meter cubed-- make sure your units are right, and I'm running out of space, so I don't have the units-- times the height, 10 meters, times the gravitational acceleration, 9.8 meters per second squared. It's a good exercise for you to make sure the units work out. It's 10,000 times 9.8, so the pressure is going to be equal to 98,000 pascals. This actually isn't that much-- it just sounds like a lot. We'll actually see that this is almost one atmosphere, which is the pressure at sea level in France, I think. Anyway, I'll see you in the next video.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-class11th-physics-fluids
" -  Represent the following data using a box-and-whiskers plot. Exclude the median when computing the quartiles. Alright, let's see if we can do this. So, we have a bunch of data, here, and they say if it helps, you might drag the numbers to put them in a different order. So, we can drag these numbers around, which is useful, because we will want to order them. The order isn't checked with your answer, and I'm doing this off of the Khan Academy exercises, so I don't have my drawing tablet here. I just have my mouse, and I'm interacting with the exercise, which I encourage you to do too, because the best way to learn any of this stuff is to actually practice it, and at Khan Academy, we have 150,000 exercises for you to practice with. Anyway, so, let's do this. Let's order this thing, so we can figure out the range of numbers. What's the lowest and what's the highest? Let's see, there's a seven here. Then, let's see, we have some eights. We've got some eights goin' on. Then we have some nines, actually we have a bunch of nines, we have four nines here. We have some nines, and then, let's see, 13 is the largest number. There we go, we've ordered the numbers. So, our smallest number is seven, and this is what the whiskers are useful for. For helping us figure out the entire range of numbers. Our smallest number is seven. Our largest number is 13, so we know the range. Now, let's plot the median, and this'll help us once getting this center line of our box, but then also we need to do that, to figure out what these other lines are, that kind of define the box. To define the middle two fourths of our number. Of our data, or the middle two quartiles. Roughly the middle two quartiles, it depends how some of the numbers work out. But this middle line is going to be the median of our entire data set. Now, the median is just the middle number. If we sort them in order, median is just the middle number. We have 11 numbers here. So, the middle one is gonna have five on either side. It's just gonna be this nine. If we had 10 numbers here, if we had an even number of numbers, you actually would of had two middle numbers, and then to find the median, you'd found the mean of those two. If that last sentence was confusing, watch the videos on Khan Academy, on median, and I go into much more detail on that. But here, I have 11 numbers, so my median is going to be the middle one. It has five larger, five less, it's this nine, right over here. If I had my pen tablet, I would circle it. So, it's this nine. That is the median. Now, we need to figure out what number is half way, what number is the median of the numbers in this bottom half? They told us to exclude the median when we compute the quartiles. So, this was the median. Let's ignore that. So, let's look at all of the numbers below that. So, this nine, eight, eight, eight, and seven. So, we have five numbers. What's the median of these five numbers? Well the median's the middle number. That is eight. So, the beginning of our second quartile is gonna be an eight, right over there. We do the same thing for our third quartile. Remember, this was our median of our entire data set. Let's exclude it. Let's look at the top half of the numbers, so to speak. There's five numbers here, in order. So, the middle one, the median of this is 10. So, that's gonna be the top of our second quartile. Just like that, we're done. We have constructed our box-and-whisker plot.",math_statistics-probability_summarizing-quantitative-data
" Let's do a survey about how we would measure the volume of fluids under US customary units. So the smallest volume of fluid that you'll hear people talk about-- and this will often be in cooking recipes or something like this-- you'll talk about a teaspoon. And most of us have teaspoons that are roughly the size of a teaspoon in our cupboards someplace. So this recipe might call for a teaspoon of sugar, or a teaspoon of salt, or a teaspoon of oil. And you've seen what it looks like. But those are the smaller spoons that you might have in your cabinets in your kitchen at home. So this might be a teaspoon right over here. Now, if you were to take 3 teaspoons together, you have something else that you would probably have in your cabinets. So if we multiply this volume, so let's say this right over here is a teaspoon. This right over here is a teaspoon of some substance. If you multiply that by 3, then you get to the tablespoon. So 3 teaspoons equal 1 tablespoon. So a tablespoon's going to be a little bit bigger. So a tablespoon might look like this. These tend to be about the size of the larger spoons that you have in your cupboard, so a tablespoon, just like that. So if you have 3 times the fluid, you get to a tablespoon. Now, if you take 2 tablespoons, put them together, then you get to the ounce. And I have to be careful here. You get to the fluid ounce. And the US customary units, they aren't designed to be super, super clear. Because you also have the ounce as a measure of weight. You have the ounce that is a measure of weight, which is equal to 1/16 of a pound. And now you have a fluid ounce, which you could either view as 2 tablespoons or, as we'll see, 1/8 of a cup. Now, you might say, well, why are they both called ounces? What's the relationship between the two? Well, there is somewhat of a relationship between the two. If you took a little bit over an ounce of water, so a weight of ounce of water, slightly over an ounce of water, that volume is going to be about a fluid ounce. An ounce of water in weight and a fluid ounce of water in volume are very, very, very close, although they aren't exactly the same thing. Now, if you think about, what would you measure here? We already talked about recipes, and teaspoon, tablespoon, fluid ounce. You might be thinking about how much medicine maybe someone might take. Maybe they need to take 2 tablespoons, which would be equivalent to a fluid ounce. Now, if you take 8 fluid ounces and put them together-- so let me draw a fluid ounce here just so we still have drawings. So you could imagine some medicines have a little cap on the top that you could put the medicine in. So if you do 2 tablespoons in it, maybe that will be a fluid ounce. Now, if you take 8 fluid ounces then you get to a cup. And many of us have this in our kitchens. We have a measuring cup that will measure exactly a cup. And you might have a recipe for pancakes that say, hey, put a cup of flour in there. And also a lot of the cups that you have in your house might be around might be around the size of a cup. If you look at, say, a can of soda that you're probably familiar with, a can of soda, the typical can of soda, is 12 ounces, not 8 ounces. So a typical can of soda is a cup and a half. We see that a cup is 8 fluid ounces. A typical can of soda is 12 fluid ounces. So it is equivalent to a cup and a half. Let me make sure this looks like a can of some kind. So if this was 12 ounces, this is 1 and 1/2 cups. But it gets you a sense of how much fluid volume a cup actually is. Now, if we were to take 2 cups, now you're dealing with a pint. And so you might have seen pints. Sometimes they're in these small cartons. So a pint might look something like this in a carton. That looks more like a house. But I think, hopefully, you get the picture that this is intended to be a carton of some kind. So you have something like that. And so the pint, it's 2 cups. And so let's say this is the fluid inside of it. Let's say this was transparent, and you might see it there. Or if you have a very large mug, that might be the size of a pint, so if you have a very large mug like this. So my best attempt at drawing a large mug, this might be roughly equal to a pint. So let me put some fluid in here. So there you go. There's my large mug. It's got a pint. Now, if you take 2 pints, now you are dealing with a quart. And you might have found yourself going to your local convenience store and buying a quart of milk. A quart of milk, those are kind of those longer but still kind of skinny looking-- so it might look something like this. I'm trying to draw a carton of a quart of milk. And then finally, if you were to take 4 quarts together, you get to a gallon. So you take 4 quarts together-- so times 4-- you get to a gallon. So we're most familiar with a gallon of milk. So let me see if I can draw a gallon of milk here, my best attempt. Well, I'm sure someone could draw a better gallon of milk here. But at least in the US, it tends to be one of the most typical ways that they sell milk. And it has, oftentimes, a little red or orange thing right on top there, so a gallon of milk. So just to review things, right here, I just multiplied from the smaller unit to the larger one. But if you want to think about everything in terms of ounces, that's one way to think about it. A cup right over here is equal to 8 ounces. 8 ounces is equal to a cup. If you multiply that by 2, then you get to 16 ounces is equal to a pint. If you multiply that by 2, you get 32 ounces. 32 ounces is equal to a quart. And if you multiply that times 4, you get 30 times 4 is 120, plus 8. You get 128 ounces per gallon. And so next time you go buy something in the supermarket, I encourage you to look at how it's being measured. And you'll see that oftentimes you might buy a quart of milk, but they'll also say that this is a 32-ounce container. And in this context, they're talking about fluid ounces.",math_4th-engage-ny_engage-4th-module-7
" Based on the examples in the last video, let's see if we can come up with some rules of thumb for figuring out how many significant figures or how many significant digits there are in a number or a measurement. So the first thing that is pretty obvious is that any non-zero digit and any of the zero digits in between are significant. Clearly, the 7 and the 5 here are significant. And the 0 in between them, it's also going to be significant. So let's write this over here. So any non-zero digits and zeros in between are going to be significant. That's pretty straightforward. Now, the zeros that are not in between nonzero digits, these become a little bit more confusing. So let's just make sure we can rule out some of them. So you can always rule out when you're thinking about significant figures, the leading 0's. And when I'm talking about leading zeros, I'm talking about the zeros that come before your non-zero digit. So these are leading zeroes here. These are leading zeroes. There is no leading zeroes here. No leading zeroes in this one, this one, and this one. But in any situation, the leading zeros are not significant. So leading zeros not significant, I'll write it over here. Leading zeros not significant. And so the last question, all you have left, I mean you only have non-zero digits and zeros in between. You could have some leading zeros, which you've already said are not significant. And so the only thing left that you have to figure out is what do you do with the trailing zeroes, the zeroes behind the last non-zero, or to the right of the last non-zero digit. So these trailing zeroes here. There's actually two trailing zeroes over here. And then there's three trailing zeroes over here. So let me make a little-- so trailing zeroes. Trailing zeroes, what do we do with them? So the easy way to think about is if you have a decimal, if there's a decimal anywhere in your number, count them. If you have a decimal, count them. Count them as significant. They are significant, count them as significant. If there's no decimal anywhere in the number, then it's kind of ambiguous. You're kind of not sure and this is a situation. So clearly over here, there's a decimal in the number, so you count the trailing zeroes. These are adding to the precision. Over here there's a decimal, so you count the trailing zero. There's a decimal here, so you count the trailing zeroes. There are no trailing zeroes here. And over here-- well, the way I later put a decimal here. Here you would count it. So if you have the decimal there, you would count all five. If you didn't have the decimal, if you just had 37,000 like that, it's ambiguous. And if someone doesn't give you more information, your best assumption is probably that they just measured to the nearest thousand. That they didn't measure exactly the one and just happened to get exactly on 37,000. So if there's no decimal, let me write it this way-- it's ambiguous, which means that you're not sure what it means, it's not clear what it means. And you're probably safer assuming to not count it. If someone really does measure, if you were to really measure something to the exact one, then you should put a decimal at the end like that. And there is a notation for specifying. Let's say you do measure-- and let me do a different number. Let's say you do measure 56,000. And there is a notation for specifying that 6 definitely is the last significant digit. And sometimes you'll see a bar put over the 6, sometimes you'll see a bar put under the 6. And that could be useful because maybe your last significant digit is this zero over here. Maybe you were able to measure to the hundreds with a reasonable level of precision. And so then you would write something like 56,000, but then you would put the bar above that zero, or the bar below that zero to say that that was the last significant digit. So if you saw something like this, you would say three significant digits. This isn't used so frequently. A better way to show that you've measured to three significant digits would be to write it in scientific notation. There's a whole video on that. But to write this in scientific notation, you could write this as 5.60 times 10 to the fourth power. Because if you multiply this times to the fourth, you would move this decimal over four spaces and get us to 56,000. So 5.60 times 10 to the fourth. And if this confuses you, watch the video on scientific notation. It will hopefully clarify things a little bit. But when you write a number in scientific notation, it makes it very clear about your precision and how many significant digits you're dealing with. So instead of doing this notation that's a little bit outdated-- I haven't seen it used much with these bars below or above the high significant digit, instead you could represent it with a decimal in scientific notation. And there it's very clear that you have three significant digits. So hopefully that helps you out. In the next couple of videos, we'll explore a little bit more why significant digits are important, especially when you do calculations with multiple measurements.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-11th-physics-units-and-measurement
" What is the nth number in the following sequence? Let's see. The first term here is a 6. So over here I'll put the term. So this is the number. I'll just write num there. That's the number. And this is the term. So the first term here is a 6. It looks like we add 3 to that to get to a 9. Or maybe there's some other pattern here. So that's the second term, is 9. Then they go from 9 to 12. Looks like we add 3 again. So we keep adding 3. So the third term is 12, the fourth term is 15. And we need to think of a general expression that will give us the value of the nth term. The nth number in the following sequence. So let's think a little bit about it. We know that we're incrementing by 3 every time and we're starting at 6. So let's write these in terms of multiples of 3, since we know that that's the increment level. This first term right here is 3 times 2. The second term right here is 3 times 3. This third term is 3 times 4. And so it looks like it's 3 times one more than the actual term you are dealing with. Right? Here, if you take your term, you add 1 and then multiply that by 3, you get 6. Take your term, add 1, then multiply it by 3. Take your term, add 1, you get 4. Then multiply by 3. Take your term, add 1-- which would be 5-- and then multiply by 3, you get 15. So it looks like any time-- so if you have your nth term. So if you go all the way out here to your nth term, the value here would be you'd add 1 to it. So you'd have n plus 1, and then you'd multiply that by 3. So the nth term is 3 times n plus 1. Or if you wanted to distribute out the 3, it'd be 3n plus 3. And just make sure that works for all of them. The first term, 3 times 1 is 3 plus 3, that works. That's 6. The second term, 3 times 2 plus 3 is 9. So it works for all of these terms. So that is the nth term. We have to assume that this pattern continues.",math_algebra-home_alg-series-and-induction
" SALMAN KHAN: This is Sal again. I'm here at Stanford Medical School with Doctor Abraham Verghese and what are we going to talk about? ABRAHAM VERGHESE: We're going to talk about the ritual of the physical exam, the bedside exam. SALMAN KHAN: The physical exam, the ritual-- why do you call it a ritual? That's interesting that you call it a ritual. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: Yeah, I think the lesson I've learned from hanging around with my anthropology colleagues here at Stanford is that rituals are all about transformation. A ritual signals the crossing of a threshold. You baptize to signal the crossing of a threshold, we marry to signal our departure from a life of solitude, loneliness, and misery to one of eternal bliss. SALMAN KHAN: Yes. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: So our lives are full of-- You shouldn't be laughing Sal. SALMAN KHAN: No. It resonates so strongly with me. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: So crossing a threshold is why we have a ritual. And I would say that the act of one individual coming to another, and telling them things they wouldn't tell their rabbi or their preacher, and then incredibly disrobing and allowing touch, I would say that that signals a ritual of incredible importance. And the fact that we, in the postmodern sort of medical world, have stopped seeing it that way and just see it as another data gathering tool may work for us, but I don't think it works for the patient. And I think that a major disconnect between us and our patients is our failure to see what they see, which is a profound ritual in which they're highly invested. And we then come and just stick our stethoscope on top of the shirt, or don't examine them thoroughly, we are sort of short changing ourselves of an important ritual. SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, and I'll feel short changed. I'm kidding. Sorry. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: But I'd love to list for you, if I may, those aspects of what makes this a ritual. So if you look at it, first of all there's always a specialized space. You don't examine a patient out in the corridor. It's always a special room, a ceremonial room if you will. Mysterious looking objects on the walls, a very specialized bed that you sit on. These are all signals that this is a virtual. Then when the physician walks in the physician often is wearing a ceremonial garb, which happens to be a white coat. SALMAN KHAN: Fascinating. This is interesting just from an anthropological point of view. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: The physician is wearing ceremonial garment. The patient is also instructed to disrobe and gets a patient garment. SALMAN KHAN: Which seems specially designed to put patients in a position of weakness. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: I know. It's quite unfortunate. We should be rethinking the [INAUDIBLE] garments [? major. ?] And then the physician then begins a systematic exam, which at some level is mysterious to the patient. It's not always clear to the patient why the physician is thumping on their chest or why the physician is saying take a deep breath, or cross your arms, or stand on tiptoe, or take your hand and touch your nose rapidly. So there's mysterious and ritualistic aspects to it. And very often the physician is using terms that are somewhat Latinate and arcane, and utterly mysterious to the patient such as fremitus, and percussion. SALMAN KHAN: What does fremitus mean? ABRAHAM VERGHESE: Fremitus means you ask the patient to say 99, and you listen, you put your hand on their chest. You pick up the vibration, and if they have consolidation or collapse the fremitus is not what it should be compared to the other side. SALMAN KHAN: The fremitus, so was it the sound or the-- ABRAHAM VERGHESE: It's more like the vibration. Sound being transmitted through and being picked up by your hand. SALMAN KHAN: Interesting. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: So the thing that's most interesting to me about the ritual is that the person coming in might be a policeman, a teacher, an entrepreneur, but in the process of putting on that gown, and sitting on that ceremonial chair, they have sort of been stripped of all that identity, and they are taking on the identity of being the patient. But conversely, I think there's something very important that happens, which is that just before this the patient has been vocalizing all their symptoms and their complaints, and at that point the physician could order ten tests, and go and look at images, but there's something about the physician then laying hands on the patient, that sort of gives weight to what the patient just talked about. You talk about your belly hurting, and then this individual carefully examines your belly. It's sort of validating your soma. Your body is being validated in this ritual. And then when you finally have the tests all sent off they become sort of-- what follows intuitively on the ritual of first having it validated on your body. One of the things that I bemoan sometimes is that at times the patient in the bed, I feel, in hospitals around America, has almost become an icon for the real patient who's in the computer. SALMAN KHAN: Right. It's just something to interface with to get to that data structure in the computer. It's interesting. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: I've coined a term for that entity in the computer. It's the iPatient. When the iPatient is getting fabulous care the real patient I think has a need to feel their complaints validated. To feel it validated on their soma, and to engage in a ritual for which there's a transformation. And you might well ask me, what is the transformation that takes place in this ritual? And, I think the transformation is the sense of the patient has delivered the story, the physician in the process of the ritual has validated that they've heard the story and tried to locate it on the soma, and the transformation is really the ceiling of the patient physician relationship. And so I think what has happened Sal, unfortunately, is that because we have so much technology we've become very sloppy in the way we examine patients. I think that we should be a hundredfold better at examining people given that we have real-time feedback with echocardiograms, angiograms, and all that. Instead of which, I think people have never been less certain of their bed side skills. SALMAN KHAN: What about this phenomenon, just talking to physicians I know in my own family, that there's so much time pressure. They have to see so many patients, one every 15 minutes, and all of this, and they wish they could do this, but they'll say that I have so many other things to worry about, and the paperwork, and all that. Is it realistic? ABRAHAM VERGHESE: No, I think that's a very real concern. But I think if you can do this well. And our goal at Stanford is to teach our students to do it very well. You actually save time. Because if you do a quick exam and you find that they're tender in a certain spot you can order the test that sources just that out, rather than, which I think is much more common, which is I don't really know what's going on, I'll tick off every box, and maybe something will fall out of the sky. So I think a directed exam, not only fulfills the ritual, but if you're any good at it, it actually allows you to ask better questions of a test you order and minimize the patient's exposure to radiation. And I think the trouble is we get all these tests, and we get back results we don't know what to do with, we stumble onto what we call incidentalomas. Have you heard that term? SALMAN KHAN: Incidentaloma. Well, I have heard that VIP's often get worse medical care because they do everything for them. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: Yeah, exactly and they wind up with finding things they don't know what to do. SALMAN KHAN: Exactly yeah over diagnosing things. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: But to come back to a ritual, I think we at Stanford are very proud to feel that, as much as we represent this great bastion of technology and advancement, we also celebrate the fundamental ritual aspects of the patient physician relationship, which is best symbolized in the physical exam. SALMAN KHAN: I think this is why a lot of physicians originally want to enter the field. It sometimes gets lost, but this is why they wanted to do it. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: And you're right. I think they often get disappointed when they learn to do this and arrive on the wards and find that no one's carrying a stethoscope, and no one's carrying-- I mean they carry the stethoscope. I think it's like a mating symbol. SALMAN KHAN: No you gotta carry one to look legitimate. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: But they don't carry the knee hammer, and they don't carry all the other tools. SALMAN KHAN: I once visited my wife at the doctor and I wore her coat, and I felt very good. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: Did you drape your stethoscope around the neck too? SALMAN KHAN: Oh I did. Yeah, I looked very authoritative. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: That's a great signal that you arrived. So I think that we have so much to learn from our anthropology colleagues about the importance of ritual. I think sometimes we operate as though medicine is all about reason, but it's really reason, ritual, emotion. They all tie in together. This is art and science. SALMAN KHAN: No. This is fascinating. I'm going to reflect on some of the rituals I do now to see if they are. Very cool. Well, thank you for this. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: Thank you so much.",science_health-and-medicine_healthcare-misc
" -  Let's say that we have a function, f of x, and it is equal to negative four times the cube root times the cube root of x. And what we want to do is we want to evaluate the derivative of our function when x is equal to eight. So see if you can figure this out. All right, now this might look foreign to you. You might say, well, I've never taken a derivative of a cube root before, but as we'll see, we can actually just apply the power rule here. Because this function can be rewritten as, so f of x can be rewritten as negative four. The cube root of x is the same thing as x to the one-third power. And now it might be a little bit clearer that we can apply the power rule. We could take this one-third, multiply it by this co-efficient, negative four. So we have negative four times one-third, and you have times x to the one-third. We just decrement that exponent to, that's a different shade of blue, to the one-third minus one power. This is the derivative. So f prime of x is equal to that, and so now we just have to simplify. This is equal negative four-thirds times x. One-third minus one is negative two-thirds power. And so if we want to evaluate f prime of eight, f prime of eight is equal to negative four-thirds times eight to the negative two-thirds power. Well that's the same thing as negative four-thirds times eight, eight to the one-third, and then raise that to negative two power. I'm just using exponent properties here. If this looks completely unfamiliar how I got from that to that, I encourage you to review exponent properties on Khan Academy. Well eight to the one-third, that is just two. So this is just two, and then two to the negative two power. Remember, let me just take some steps here. It's a good review. This is equal to negative four-thirds times two to the negative two is the same thing as one over two to the two. These two things are equivalent. That and that. One over two to the two is the same thing as two to the negative two. So this is one over four, and so this is going to simplify to negative one over three. Is equal to negative one over three, and we are done.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-derivative-rules
" -  What I want to do in this video is talk about the processes that make all life as we know it, life as we know it, and at it's essence, we can call this metabolism. Metabolism. And this is the taking energy in different forms, breaking it down into its more fundamental components, and then building it up in ways that we would find useful, useful for energy, useful for structure, so that we can actually live our lives, we can grow, we can reproduce, we can respond to our surroundings. So as I just said, metabolism, and we're gonna go into a bunch of examples of this. Metabolism at it's heart is really two different processes. There's the breaking down of the substances for energy or for structure to getting back to the building blocks, and we call that catabolism. Catabolism. So this is the breaking down of things and then once we've broken down things, we're ready to rebuild them in ways that we would find useful, and we call this anabolism. Anabolism or anabolism. Anabolism, just like that. And one way to think about it is imagine that someone had built something with Legos and you want to build something with Legos. Well you could go to those Legos and you'd want to break it down, but not break it down too much. You wouldn't melt the plastic. You would break it down into the individual Lego pieces and then you would build it back up into whatever shape that you actually cared about. And you might not actually have to even break it down all the way to the basic Lego pieces. There might be structures in that first Lego castle that was constructed that you might find useful. So let's just think about how all of this gets started. And what's exciting is that all of this got started, or gets started, from stars, from fusion reactions in stars. And this right over here is a picture of a star, and a star that we are very familiar with. This is the sun. But you may or may not realize that the sun is only one of probably several stars that have been involved in life as we know it. The sun is our most direct source of energy for most of life as we know it. There are some bacteria and things that are able to live off of vents at the bottom of the ocean because of the heat created, but the sun is our primary source of energy. But when I say that other stars might have been involved, including dead stars that existed billions of years ago, it's because the heavier elements that we're composed of, or that are around us in the environment, the carbon, the oxygen, we could just keep going, pretty much everything other than hydrogen, it was constructed in fusion reactions from hydrogen inside of stars. So we really are made up of the remts of stars. And so here we are, we're on Earth. Earth is all this condensed matter from four and a half billion years ago. Probably some nearby supernova got all of this dust that was constructed in a previous star to coalesce in that way, and you have radiation. You have energy from the sun. And once again, that energy's coming from fusion reactions, and it's what fusing lighter elements into heavier elements, so the sun is also constructing more heavy elements, but that energy, that energy makes its way to the Earth. And you have organisms, like plants, that are able to use that energy to construct the material, the food, we could say, that is eventually going to get around to us. And so this process you may or may not be familiar with it, this is photosynthesis. And we're going to go into a lot more detail. Synthesis. And as the word implies, photo, it's photosynthesis, it's making things out of light, and one thing I like to ask people when they are first exposed to photosynthesis, is like okay, we can see this grass growing or we can see this wheat growing, or we can see a tree growing, but where is that material coming from? And the most common answer is like, ""Oh, somehow it's coming from the ground,"" and there are some nutrients that are coming from the ground but it's really all about fixing carbon, and you're going to hear about this a lot especially as we talk about the carbon cycle. But you have carbon dioxide primarily in the air, so you have carbon, you have, I'll just write it this way. So you have carbon dioxide in the air and what photosynthesis allows these plants to do is take the carbon in that carbon dioxide and form bonds with it, turn it from its gas form into solid forms, into glucose molecules, and then use that glucose to build up cellulose and to build out other forms of starch and whatever else it might be. So it's taking these molecules in the air... I'll just draw them as these little... It's taking these molecules that are in the air, and it's using the energy of the sun to fix them, to actually form bonds between the carbons and with other things. As we said, we're mostly carbon and hydrogen and we have some oxygen in there, but we're able to form these structures. Now from there other living organisms, and this is a huge oversimplification, it could involve bacteria, it could involve all sorts of things. And just a reminder, you know, that photosynthesis, it isn't just light and it isn't just the carbon dioxide. It also involves the water and we talk about that. So you also have water involved. You also have the water involved. So you have the carbon dioxide, so CO2, light from the sun, and water. These things are able to grow and nutrients from the Earth. And then from that, you're able to construct things like, well, you can directly go to these plants that are taking energy from the sun and construct things like bread or you have other animals that will eat things like the grass, and then break them down in their own way and they will be assisted by bacteria and then rebuild themselves up into a cow, into milk. And so what this cow is doing, it's metabolizing this grass. It's able to break it down, it's able to catabolize the various molecules in the grass and break them down into building blocks that can then used to build up the cow, to build up milk, and whatever else. And you might be saying, ""What are these types of molecules ""that we keep breaking down ""and then building back up?"" Well, you have carbohydrates. Carbohydrates, and you're going to see most of the molecules that I'm about to talk about. Frankly, all of them on the back of nutritional package because it tells you what's inside of it. What is your body going to metabolize when it eats that whatever's inside of the package? So carbohydrates, these are either simple sugars like glucose or fructose, or it could be polymers of these sugars, polysaccharides. It could be starches made up of many, many elements of the... Or many, many multiples of these simple sugars. We could be talking about lipids. Lipids. So fatty acids, we could be talking about cholesterols. These are essential structures, and they're also essential for, well, various metabolic pathways inside of, well, all of life, or it could be proteins. It could be proteins made up of amino acids. Sometimes people say the reason why you want the proteins is because it's made up of these amino acids. So you could break down these proteins and get the amino acids and then build it up into new proteins. Proteins and amino acids. And all of these things, they are found in things like in the foods, in the foods we eat, which we will then consume, we will then metabolize. We will first catabolize them and break them down and then we will use those building blocks to build it back up. And at the end of the day, these provide the structures that make our bodies what they are. They allows us to interact with our environment and they provide energy, and that energy, at the end of the day, the true molecular currency for that energy is a molecule called ATP. That's a molecule of ATP right over there. Adenosine triphosphate. And the key for ATP, why it is the molecular currency for energy, are the three phosphate groups. So it has these three phosphate groups and we have a whole video on it, or a whole series of videos on it really, but the main key is that there's a lot of energy, especially beween I guess on the last phosphate group. And this energy and that bond as the phosphate group breaks off it can release it to provide all sorts of life mechanisms including being able to metabolize things. So ATP right over here, this is the currency of energy in life as we know it. And it's actually an interesting molecule because it's essentially, it's a piece of... If you were to just take this section of it right over here, it really is, it looks like a piece of RNA. It looks like you're taking a... You have ribose, you have the adenine, you have a phosphate group, and it can actually be used to construct things like RNA and even DNA beyond just being the molecular currency of energy. So it's fun to see how these pieces all fit together, how they can be broken up, and you see these patterns over and over again in biological systems, and these biological systems are really just made up of breaking down and building back up carbohydrates, lipids, fatty acids, cholesterols, other things, and proteins/amino acids. So this whole thing, you know, look around you, look at your day, look at the things you're consuming and you'll see this pattern over and over and over again and it's all a little mind-blowing, because at the end of the day, the energy is coming from the fusion reaction in stars and all of the heavy elements around you or even the not so heavy elements, all of the carbon, the oxygen, all of the really non-hydrogen elements, they've been made inside of fusion reactions in stars that might have existed billions and billions and billions of years ago, 1so hopefully that makes you feel a little bit more connected 1to the universe.",science_biology_energy-and-enzymes
" -  What we're going to do in this video is discuss the difference between normative statements and positive statements, and you'll see these words used usually in an economic context, sometimes a philosophical one. A normative statement is one that really is a matter of opinion, maybe a matter of ethics, something that someone thinks is how the world should be. While a positive statement is something that, it doesn't necessarily have to be true but it's something that can be tested. So what we're going to do in this video is look at a bunch of statements around economics and think about whether they would be classified as normative statements, things that are opinions, that are a matter of ethics or morals, or whether they are positive statements, things that can be tested. So let's look at our first statement. This says, ""Paying people who aren't working, ""even though they could work, is wrong and unfair."" So regardless of whether or not you agree with this statement, is it a normative statement or a positive statement? Well the fact that someone's saying it's wrong and it's unfair, this is pretty clearly a matter of opinion so this would be a normative statement. You can't test whether this is wrong or unfair, you would just have to believe that it is wrong and unfair. Now let's look at another statement. Programs like welfare reduce the incentive for people to work. Is this a normative statement or a positive statement? Well it might feel a little normative, it might feel like this is an opinion, but it actually can be tested. You could institute some welfare program on some small scale and compare it to a comparable place where there isn't a welfare program and see what it does for incentives to work, you survey people, you see how many people work in one situation or another. It might be a false statement, it might be a true statement, but either way, it actually can be tested, so this would be a positive statement so I'll put it in this category right over here, this is a positive, positive statement. Alright, let's look at another one. This say, ""Raising taxes on the wealthy to pay ""for government programs grows the economy."" Is that a normative statement or a positive statement? Well once again, this can be tested. It might be true, it might be false, maybe your test is even inconclusive, but it can be tested, you could try to run a simulation, you could look at case studies of countries that did do this and see what happens to their economy versus ones that didn't do it. And so this is, even though it looks like something that someone who favors raising taxes on the wealthy maybe out of fairness arguments, something that they would say, this statement itself is not normative, the statement can be tested, so this is a positive statement. A good giveaway for normative statement, if it said something like it is fair to raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for government programs, that would have been a normative statement or we should do this, that would have been a normative statement but here, this is something that's testable. Now the next statement, ""Raising taxes on the wealthy ""slows economic growth."" Is that a normative statement or a positive statement? Well, once again, this might feel like someone who is against raising taxes, who think it's unfair to raise taxes on the wealthy, something that they would say but the statement itself can actually be tested. So this is also a positive statement, even though in some ways it's the opposite statement as the one that we just did. Because once again, we could look at countries that did this and countries that didn't do this, we could run a computer simulation to try to understand whether this statement is true. Let's do one last statement. This says, ""The government should raise taxes ""on the wealthy to pay for helping the poor."" Is this normative or positive? Well in this situation, the word should is a pretty big giveaway, should, or it's fair or unfair, this is someone's opinion, it's not something that's testable, you can't test whether this statement is right or wrong, it's based on, do you believe ethically, morally, that this is true? And so this is a normative statement, so I'll put it in the normative column. So big picture, these words normative and positive, these are fancy words but all they mean is normative is a matter of morals or opinion and can't really be tested while a positive statement, whether they're right or wrong or whether you agree or disagree with them, these are things that in theory could be tested.",economics-finance-domain_macroeconomics_macro-basic-economics-concepts
"  Imagine that we've got your arm here, and you got these nice big strong muscles, and you're holding in your hand a weight. Let's say that you're holding a two-pound weight. Here is a two-pound weight. Let's say that you are holding it in your hand and you want to lift it up. As you lift this two-pound weight, you notice that there is some resistance, and you definitely are able to notice that there is a weight in your hand. Let's say that we took this weight and you didn't know, let's say I grabbed the weight out of your hand and I replaced it with another weight that was 2.05 pounds. I've got this 2.05-pound weight, and it's the same exact shape and everything, and it's just .05 pounds heavier. Let's say that we replaced this guy with the 2.05-pound weight. Let's say that I asked you to lift this new 2.05-pound weight, and you might lift it, and you may notice that it's different, but most people in general would not notice any difference. They would just think it's the same exact two-pound weight. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that this .05-pound increase in the weight, for most people probably, would not be noticeable. Let's say that instead of giving you a 2.05-pound weight let's say that I gave you a weight that was 2.2 pounds, and let's say you close your eyes and I took this two-pound weight out of your hand, and I replaced it with this new 2.2-pound weight, and then I ask you to lift the new weight. Most people would probably notice this new increase, this new weight. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that a addition of .05 pounds probably wouldn't get noticed, whereas an addition of 0.2 pounds would get noticed. The threshold at which you're able to notice an increase or a change in weight or really any sensation so that threshold, where you go from not noticing a tiny little change to actually noticing a tiny little change is known as the just noticeable difference, noticeable difference. We can abbreviate this as JNT. In this case, the just noticeable difference, let's say for just sake of argument, is .2 pounds, .2 pounds. OK. Let's imagine that instead of starting with a two-pound weight, instead, we started with a five-pound weight, so five-pound weight. The five-pound weight is much heavier than the two-pound weight. In this case, if I replace the five-pound weight with a 5.2-pound weight, because it's a lot heavier and you're using a lot more muscle fibers in order to lift the five-pound weight, you may not notice the .2-pound increase. Whereas if I replaced the five-pound weight with a 5-1/2-pound weight, so 5.5-pound weight, and I asked you to lift it, you might notice the half a pound increase, but you might not notice the .2-pound increase. Basically, what's going on here is that since you're using more muscle fibers, you're using more sensory neurons, they're not as sensitive to small increases. They're not as sensitive to the 0.2-pound increase. You need a bigger just noticeable difference in order to actually be mentally aware of the change in weight. Basically, when you're holding five pounds, let's say for sake of argument, the just noticeable difference is a little bit higher than when you're holding two pounds. Now, these numbers we're just throwing around, and if you actually did this experimentally, the actual numbers might be different, but the concept generally would remain the same. In the five-pound weight category, the just noticeable difference is .5 pounds. From this, we can come up with an equation. Let's just define some variables. I, or the intensity of the stimulus, is equal to two pounds in this case and five pounds in this case. And delta I, so delta I, would be the just noticeable difference. It would be 5.5 pounds minus five pounds equals half a pound. For the five-pound example, I would be five, and delta I would be .5, and then in the two-pound example, I would be two, and delta I would be .2. Basically, there is actually a guy back in the day named Weber. Weber noticed in 1834 that the ratio of the increment threshold, the ratio of the increment threshold, which is this over here, to the background intensity, which is this over here, so this is the background intensity, is constant. If we were to take .2 divided by two, and if we were to take .5 divided by five, this ratio is actually equal, and it equals .1, and this ratio would be more or less fairly constant for a bunch of different weights. That's what Weber's law is. Weber, in 1834, realized that there is this relationship. We can write this as an equation. Delta I over I equals K. K is a constant for each individual person. There is this particular threshold, and the ratio, the background intensity to the incremental threshold is relatively constant, and that constant is this K value. This part of the equation over here is known as the Weber fraction. This works for sensory tactile stimuli like lifting a weight but it also works for auditory stimuli. Imagine you're in a quiet room. If you're in a quiet room with someone else, you can whisper. You can talk really, really softly and the person can hear you. But if you're at a rock concert, you have to be yelling at the top of your lungs in order for someone next to you to hear you. That's because the background intensity in a quiet room versus a concert is different, and so the delta I, which is whether you're just whispering or whether you're yelling, is different in accordance with the background intensity. That's what the Weber's law is basically saying. If we take this equation over here, let me just give myself a little bit of space. If we take this equation, Weber's law, and rearrange it, so we have delta I equals the background intensity times this constant, if we arrange it, we can see that this Weber's law predicts a linear relationship between the incremental threshold, which is this value over here, and the background intensity. In other words, as the background intensity gets bigger, the incremental threshold gets bigger. If we were to draw a little graph, if we were to draw a graph where the x-axis is the background intensity and the y-axis was the incremental, the difference threshold, what we would see would be this linear relationship. Using the concert example over here, a really, really big background intensity would result in a delta I, so this would be ... Let's say delta I in this case was how loud you were talking. The delta I would have to be a lot bigger than if you were in a quiet room, so quiet room. This law would generally hold true for almost any type of stimulus. It's a good rule of thumb. It's not exactly set in stone, but it is kind of how most of your different sensations operate, where if there is a bigger background intensity, you need a bigger difference threshold in order to actually perceive the sensation. In the real world, sometimes people add a different value. You got delta I over I equals K. This is the normal Weber's law. Some people will even add in another constant over here in order to take into account the baseline level of activity that needs to be surpassed in real-world situations. So this equation can be modified in order to more accurately represent what goes on in the real world.",science_health-and-medicine_nervous-system-and-sensory-infor
" You're having a movie marathon. Each movie lasts about 1 and 3/4 hours. If you want to watch 3 movies, how long will your movie marathon last? You can use the number line below to help you find your answer. So each movie lasts 1 and 3/4 hours long. So let's say the first movie happens to be Star Wars, which I probably would include in any movie marathon. So it's going to be 1 and 3/4 hours long. So this is 1,. 1, and then we're going to have 3/4 more. So each of these are a fourth because we have 4 sections between 1 and 2-- 1, 2, 3, 4. So we're going to watch 3/4. 1, 2, 3. So that's how long my first movie is. And then, my second movie is going to be another 1 and 3/4. So 1 is 4/4. So 1, 2, 3, 4. And then we're going to have another 3/4. 1, 2, 3. And just as the way I said that, 4/4 and 3/4 is 7/4. So 1 and 3/4, that's the same thing as 7/4. And you see that over here. When I did the 1 and 3/4 in blue, I actually marked off 7/4. Same thing here, here in magenta. And now, let's do it in green. So Gandhi is actually a good bit longer than 1 and 3/4, but it's a good movie, so I put it here just because it's one of my favorites. And so let's do another 1 and 3/4 hours. Or we could do that as 4/4 plus 3/4 hours, or 7/4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So that gets us to 5. So this point right over here is 5 and 1/4 hours. Now, let's see if we get that same result when we do it mathematically. I guess this is mathematical as well. But every movie lasts 1 and 3/4 hours. We already said that 1 and 3/4 is the same thing as 1 plus 3/4. 1 is the same thing as 4/4. So it's 4/4 plus 3/4, which is the same thing as 7/4. And another way to convert this mixed number into an improper fraction, you say, hey, look. 4 times 1 is 4-- and that's really where you're getting the 4/4 from-- plus 3 is 7. 7/4. Now, we're going to do 7/4 of an hour three times. So we're going to multiply 7/4 times 3. Now, there are several ways that you could think about this. You could literally view this as having three 7/4 and adding them together. So 7/4 plus 7/4 plus 7/4, which would be equal to 21/4. And if you wanted to convert this into a mixed number, 21/4 is the same thing as-- well, 4 goes into 20 evenly. So you could call this 20/4 plus 1/4. And 20/4 is the same thing as 5. So it's 5 and 1/4, which is exactly what we saw here. Another way of thinking about it, you could say 7/4. And then we can multiply it by 3/1, times 3/1, just to make it clear that we're multiplying the numerators and multiplying the denominators. So in the numerator, I'm to have 7 plus 7 plus 7. That's 7 times 3. And in the denominator, I'm going to have 4 times 1, which is just 4. Well, this is just 7 times 3 over 4, or 21/4, which we've already seen is 5 and 1/4.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_4th-multiply-fractions
"  We've done a lot of aldol condensations, and in particular, we've looked at the mechanism in great detail. In this video, we're going to think about doing things in reverse. So we're going to start with a retro aldol reaction and see how that way of thinking can apply to retro synthesis. And so let's start with cinnamaldehyde right here. And if we do a retro aldol reaction, the mechanism is pretty much the exact reverse of an aldol condensation. And so if we had a base like sodium carbonate, we're gonna form benzaldehyde and acid aldehyde. A cinnamaldehyde is the molecule that gives cinnamon its smell, and benzaldehyde smells like almonds, and so this is a pretty cool experiment to do. You can stat with the molecule that smells like cinnamon and end with a molecule that smells like almonds. Let's analyze our cinnamaldehyde starting compound here to see how we would have formed those products. We know the carbon next to our carbonyl is our alpha carbon. And we know the carbon next to that is the beta carbon. And so looking at the structure, all right, we know that there's a hydrogen attached to our alpha carbon like that. So we think about breaking this double bonds, right? We can see this this two carbon setup over here on the right for acid aldehyde, right, so those are the two carbons, and this is the hydrogen that's bonded to that alpha carbon there. Looking at the structure again on the right, we know that there are two more hydrogens bonded to that alpha carbon, and so therefore, if we're doing things in reverse, we can think about adding two hydrogens to this alpha carbon, and then go ahead and draw two hydrogens right here, so I'm just going to write H2. And then we can think about adding an oxygen to the beta carbons, and we can think about adding H2O. I know there's already a hydrogen on that beta carbon, so I could think about this being the hydrogen on that carbon. All right and then if I add an oxygen to that carbon, that would be this oxygen right here. So just a, a way of thinking in reverse, right? Adding water, right, breaking your double bond and adding an oxygen and two hydrogens will, is one way of thinking about forming your product here. So or you can think about the reverse. You can think about losing water from this portion and sticking these two fragments together to give you your aldol condensation product. So once again, this way of thinking can be can be very useful if you're trying to retro synthesize something, so if you're thinking in reverse. So for example, let's say a question on a test was show how you could synthesize this enone here, so once again we're gonna do the same kind of analysis. We're gonna find our alpha carbon right here; this is our alpha carbon, and this is beta carbon. All right, so attached to our alpha carbon, all right, we know that there's a hydrogen right here, so we're gonna think about breaking this double bond, right? So let's go ahead and draw a retro synthesis arrow here. So we're gonna break that double bond, so on the left, all right, we're gonna have our benzine ring. We're gonna have our carbonyl here. And then we're gonna have a hydrogen attached to this carbon, attached to our alpha carbon. And remember, we're gonna add two hydrogens to our alpha carbon. So we're gonna add two hydrogens to our alpha carbon, and that would give us the ketone that we would need. Right, for our beta carbon, we know there's already a hydrogen attached right here, and so we're going to add an oxygen to this beta carbon on the left, so this is our way of thinking about it. So over here on the right we're gonna have we're gonna have our carbonyl. All right, and then we're adding an oxygen, right, we're adding a oxygen right here. And then we had that hydrogen, so I'm gonna go ahead and draw that hydrogen in blue. And then we can go ahead and draw our ring. So we have our ring right here. And then we have our nitro group coming off over here. So just to check ourselves and make sure that this is the right way of thinking about it in reverse, if we take water from this portion, right? And stick those two fragments together. Then that would give us our conjugated enone product over here on the left. And so that's, again, one way of thinking about how to do these sorts of problems. And so if they if they wanted you to give some some reaction conditions here, you can go ahead and, and draw what you would need, right? So you would say, I need to start with this ketone, right? Like this and then I would also need an aldehyde, so I'm redrawing the 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde product, right? So we have 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde like this. All right, so this compound, this ketone, of course, is this compound right here. And then 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde here is the same one that we drew right here. So if you take those two, right, and you, and you put them together, you should form your conjugated enone. Because remember, thinking about your alpha protons, right, there are no alpha protons on our 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde. Right, so this,this carbon right here doesn't have any alpha protons, so the only source for alpha protons would be this carbon right here. This is your only alpha carbon with alpha protons on it. So in terms of in terms of what else we would need, we would need a base, all right, to do our alpha condensation, so we could add a something like sodium hydroxide as our base. And we could we could create a solution of sodium hydroxide and water, and then also ethanol so if you took these ketone right in this aldehyde and use these reaction conditions, you should form the conjugate enone as your major product. And so that how to how to synthesize it, so once again thinking in reverse. Let's do another one. This one's a little bit different because we don't have an enone for an enol as our target compound. We have an aldol as our target compound. Well, we can use the same kind of thinking. We can find our carbonyl and identify the carbon next to that as being our alpha carbon and then thinking about this as being our beta carbon, right? And we know that this is the bond that forms. So we can think about breaking this bond. And and we know right, we know that we have a hydrogen on this carbon right here, as I'm just gonna see if I can stick it into there. So when I think about retrosynthesis, all right I go ahead and draw my retrosynthesis arrow in here, so on the left, I mean I can see on the left that I'm going to have this carbon two, three, four and five, right? So I have these five carbons right here so, we go ahead and draw those in. So we have our carbonyl, and then we have our five carbons, and then I already have this hydrogen in magenta, and we're only going to add on hydrogen this time. So let me go ahead and draw in one hydrogen in green because this isn't the congregated product. We stopped at the aldol if you're thinking about it in reverse. So we're not going to add two hydrogens, we're only going to add one here, and so what else would we need; so over here on the right, let's think about the fact that there is hydrogen attached to this carbon right here. And then how many carbons will we have for our other compound, one two three and four, so we need a 4-carbon carbonyl. Right, and there's a hydrogen attached to it, so a 4-carbon, carbonyl. Let me go ahead and draw that in, one, two, three four, and then we have this hydrogen ion glued to it. So now, we've identified and thinking about it in reverse, what compounds we would need to form this aldol product. We would need this ketone and this aldehyde. But, in terms of in terms of actually synthesizing the aldol compound on the left, we have to be a little bit careful about how to do it. We need to do a directed aldol addition here, so let's think about starting with this ketone, all right? So think about starting with this ketone here, so let me go ahead and redraw it. I'm going to draw it in a slightly different way. All right, so that's this ketone right here. And to that ketone, we're going to add LDA. So we're going to form a lithium enolate here, and once we've formed our lithium enolate, then we can add our aldehyde. So in our second step, we can add our aldehyde in here, so we talked about this in earlier video. So we have our aldehyde as a 4-carbon aldehyde, all right, so we're going to add butanal. And then that's going to give us a, a lithium alkoxide, right? So we need to we need to protonate the alkoxide, so in the workup, we can add some water here. And that would give us our aldol product, so that would give us this, so that is the way to synthesize our aldol products. Let me go ahead and draw it in here, right, so we would form this. Okay, so a directed aldol addition. Let's do, let's do one more of this retrosynthesis approach. And let's think about how to make this molecule. So this is a little bit different than before. Okay, but we can do our same stuff. So we can identify our alpha carbon, right, the one next to our carbonyl. And then our beta carbon is the one next to that, right? So we can think about breaking this double bond, all right, and adding two hydrogens to our alpha carbon, right? So let’s go ahead and do that, so we’re going to break that double bond and add two hydrogens to the alpha carbons, so thinking about this in terms of retrosynthesis, we have a ring here. All right and then let me, let me go ahead and draw this over here. We would have two hydrogens over here. Let me go ahead and get some more room. All right, so probably easier to think about adding your oxygen to your beta carbon first, so let's do that. All right, we know we're gonna add an oxygen to our beta carbon. So let's go ahead and put in our oxygen on our beta carbon; I'll do that in green. Right, and then we're gonna think about two hydrogens to our alpha carbons, so we're gonna draw in our alpha carbon like that, and we're gonna add two hydrogens; I'm gonna put those in green like this. And this is a little bit more room, and then we would have our carbonyl like that, and then we would have to make sure count your carbons when we're doing these. All right? So let's go ahead and show those carbons. So this carbon right here is this carbon. All right. And then, this carbon is this one right here. And then this carbon, our carbonyl one is right here. 1And so you can see this is actually an intramolecular aldol condensation. 1So if you think about losing water right here, right, and sticking those 1two fragments together, you would form this compound on the left, and so this 1is a pretty cool reaction. 1Right, we could we could redraw this, right, so 1on an exam, right, you might, I mean, you 1could draw it like that, but most of the 1time, you would see it in a different conformation. 1All right, so you would see the compound looking like this. 1So let me go ahead and draw that. 1So identify your carbons. 1Carbon in magenta is the one right here. 1Carbon in blue is the one right here. 1And the carbon in red is the one right here, which has your carbonyl. 1And then we are going to go ahead and make our alpha carbon 1right here green, so this carbon right here, so this must have been, this 1must have been your starting compound, right, and so if you add a 1base, right, you can convert, you can 1convert this molecule into your target compound. 1So once again an intramolecular aldol condensation. 1And we'll talk in more detail about those in the next video.",science_organic-chemistry_ochem-alpha-carbon-chemistry
" To get a better intuition for the price elasticity of demand, I thought I would take a look at some of the more extreme cases and think about what types of elasticities of demand we would see. So this right over here is a vial of insulin. Many diabetics, not all diabetics, but many diabetics need to take insulin daily. They need to inject it in order to maintain their blood sugar level. If they don't do it, bad things will happen to their body. And they might even prematurely die if they don't take their insulin on time. So let's think about what the elasticity of demand might look like for something like insulin. So in one column, I'll put price. And in the other column, I will put quantity. So let's say that insulation right now is going for $5 a vial. And we have a group of diabetics who need insulin. And they're all going to buy the insulin they need. And let's say, in this group, that turns out to be 100 vials per week. So this is in vials per week. Fair enough, that's exactly what they need to do to maintain their insulin. Now, what happens if the price changes? What happens if the price were to go down? Let's say the price were to go down to $1. Well, what would the quantity be? Well, they're not going to buy any more insulin. They're going to buy just what they need in order to maintain their diabetes. And remember, we're holding all else equal. We're not assuming any change in expectations of price. They expect price go up or down or anything like that So in this case, they'll still just by 100 vials. Now, what happens if the price went up a ton? And what happens if the price went to-- what happens if we went to $100 a vial. Well, it would be hard for them. But they need it to survive. So it's going to squeeze out any other expenses that they need to spend money on. And so they still will buy 100 vials a week. And so you could keep raising price, within reason. And they would still buy the same quantity. Obviously, if you raise it to $1 billion, then they would just wouldn't be able to afford it. But within reason, they're going to buy 100 vials per week, no matter what the price is. So this is an example of perfect inelasticity. Another way, so if you think of the physical analogy that we talked about with elasticity. It's like a brick. It doesn't matter how much, within reason once again, any amount of force pulling or pushing that a human could put on a brick, it's not going to change. It's not going to deform the brick in any way. And likewise, any change in price within reason, within reason here, isn't going to change the demand in any way. It's perfectly inelastic. And if you want to do the computation, you could look at inelas-- you could figure out the demand elasticity for, let's say, when you're going from a price of $5 to $1. So the price went down by 4. And the quantity changed by 0. So your percent change in quantity, so delta percent-- I'll write it-- percent change in quantity is equal to 0. And then, your percent is going to be over your percent change in price if you use the averaging method. It was-- it would be going down by 4 over an average of 250. It'll be a fairly large number. But at 0 over anything is still going to be 0. So it doesn't matter what that thing is over here. Your elasticity of demand in this situation is 0. And if you wanted to see what this demand curve would look like, let's plot it. So this right over here is my price axis. And that is my quantity axis. And so no matter what, let's say this is a quantity of 100 of vials per week. That's true when the price is $5. So that's true in the prices $5. They're going to demand 100 vials a week. That's true when the price is $1. They're going to demand 100 vials a week. And that's true, if the price is $20 or $100 or whatever. They're going to demand 100 vials a week. And so a perfectly inelastic demand curve would look like this. It is a vertical line. It doesn't matter what price you pick. The quantity demanded is always going to be the exact same thing. Now, let's go to another extreme. So this is perfectly inelastic. You can imagine. Well, what is perfectly elastic. Something that changes a lot if you have a small percentage change in price. And to think about that, let's look at these two vending machines. And you see that they both do sell cans of Coke. That's a can of Coke there. That is can of Coke there. And let's say, starting off, the can of Coke, let's say that they cost $1 in each vending machine. And we're going to assume that this one, remember all else equal. So we're going to assume that this vending machine right over here doesn't change. Does not change. So it's just going to be consistently charging $1 for a can of Coke. And they're sitting next to each other. And it looks like they have a little coffee machine in between right over here. So let's think about the demand curve for this, for Coca Cola in this vending machine right over here. So let's think about the price and the quantity. So I'll do-- let me do price column and quantity demanded. So let's say if the price is $1. So if the price is $1, then just odds are, it's going to get about half of the sales per week. And let's say that ends up being, I don't know, let's say that ends up being 100 cans. This is in cans per week. Now what happens? And let me put some decimals here. So this is $1.00. The price is $1.00. It sells 100 cans per week. And probably this one also would also sell about 100 cans per week. Now, what happens if we have a very, very small change in price. So if we change, if we go from $1.00, instead of $1.00, we are at $0.99. What's going to happen? So this, remember, this machine right over here is not changing. This is-- we're talking-- our demand curve is for the quantity of Cokes sold from this machine. And the price was for this machine. So if this machine is even a penny cheaper. And assuming that people, there aren't lines forming and things like that, people are just always going to go to this machine. If it's easy enough, if there's no difference, they're always going to go to this machine. So this machine will be able to get, will sell all the Cokes. So it's going to sell 200 Cokes. Now, what happens if, instead of lowering the price by a penny, you raise the price by a penny. So instead of $1.00, your at $1.01. Well, now everyone's going to go to the other vending machine. They're going to say, oh, we don't-- even a penny, might as well walk to this one. Assuming everything else is equal. So then, they're going to sell 0. And so what would the demand curve look like here. Let's plot it out. So this is the price. This right over, this axis right over here is quantity. And this is in cans per week. And so this is 0. This is 100. And then, this is 200. And then this is a price of $1. That's $1. So at $1, the quantity demanded is 100 cans. Fair enough. Now, at $0.99, the quantity demanded is 200 cans. So at $0.99, the quantity demanded is 200. So $0.99 is right below that, it's 200. So it's right over there. It's like right, right, there's a little bit lower. And $1.01 a little bit over here, the quantity demanded is 0. So the demand curve here is looks something like that. So it's going to be almost horizontal. So it's going to be approaching perfect elasticity, very small changes in price end up with these huge changes, huge changes in percent quantity demanded. And I courage to work out the math to see here, that you will get a very large number for elasticity. And so something that is, this is approaching perfect elasticity. A truly perfect elasticity would be something that is a horizontal line. So in this case, so over here, our elasticity of demand-- and I'll talk about the absolute value of it, is 0. And over here, the absolute value of our elasticity of demand is infinity. '50 Because, remember, it's percent change in quantity over percent change in price. When you go from either, from one scenario to another over here, you're percent change in price is very small. It's roughly about 1% in this scenario right over here. Changing the price up or down about 1%. But then, you see your quantity is changing, depending on which one you're looking. Your quantity is changing on the order of 50% to 100%, from that 1% change in price. So you have a huge elasticity of demand here. It would be a real-- it would actually be a number. But as you can imagine, as it becomes more and more sensitive, as quantity demanded becomes more and more sensitive to a percent change in price, this curve is going to flatten out completely. And you will have an infinite, absolute value of your elasticity of demand.",economics-finance-domain_ap-microeconomics_unit-2-supply-and-demnd
" We're told this table shows equivalent ratios to 24 to 40. Fill in the missing values. And they write the ratio 24 to 40 right over here. 24-- when the numerator is 24, the denominator is 40. So in that way, you could think of 24/40. But then they want us to write equivalent ratios where we have to fill in different blanks over here-- here in the denominator and here in the numerator. And there's a bunch of ways that we could actually tackle this. But maybe the easiest is to start with the ratio that they gave us, where they gave us both the numerator and the denominator, and then move from there. So for example, if we look at this one right over here, the numerator is 12. It is half of the 24. So the denominator is also going to be half of the denominator here. It's going to be half of 40. So we could stick a 20 right over there. And then we could go up here. If you compare the 3 to the 12, to go from 12 to 3, you have to divide by 4. So in the numerator, you're dividing by 4. So in the denominator, you also want to divide by 4. So 20 divided by 4 is 5. And then we have one more to fill in, this numerator right over here. And we see from the denominator, we doubled the denominator. We went from 40 to 80. So we would double the numerator as well, and so you would get 48. And what we just did here is we wrote four equivalent ratios. The ratio 3 to 5 or 3/5 is the same thing as 12 to 20, is the same thing as 24 to 40, is the same thing as 48 to 80. Let's make sure we got the right answer. Let's do a couple more of these. The following table shows equivalent fractions to 27/75. So then they wrote all of the different equivalent fractions. This table shows ratios equivalent to 18/55. Fair enough. All right, so these are all equivalent to 27/75. These are all equivalent to 18/55, so all of these. Which fraction is greater, 27/75 or 18/55? So this is an interesting thing. What we want to do-- because you look at these two things. And you're like, well, I don't know. Their denominators are different. How do I compare them? And the best way that I can think of comparing them is look at a point where you're getting an equivalent fraction. And either the numerators are going to be the same, or the denominators are going to be the same. So let's see if there's any situation here. So you have this situation where we see 27/75 is 54/150. And over here, we see that 18/55 is 54-- and this 54 jumped out at me because it's the same numerator-- over 165. And that makes the comparison much easier. What is smaller? 54/150 or 54/165? Well, if you have the same numerator, having a larger denominator will make the number smaller. So 54/165 is smaller than 54/150, which tells us that 18/55 is smaller than 27/75. So let's see, which of these? So this is saying that 27/75 is greater than 18/55, and that is absolutely right. And let's do one more of these. Lunara's friends are running a race. Each of them runs at a constant speed starting at time 0. Which of these tables might show the distances one of Lunara's friends traveled over time? So they're running a race. Each of them runs at a constant speed starting at time 0. So table 1-- so distance run in meters. So they're running at a constant speed. So really, the ratio between distance and time should be constant throughout all of these possible tables. So here you have a ratio of 3 to 2. If you triple the distance, we're tripling the time. If you multiply the distance by 5, we're multiplying the time by 5. So table 1 seems completely reasonable. Let's keep going. Table 2-- 11 to 4 and then 12 to 5. Here, it's just incrementing by 1, but the ratios are not the same. 11 to 4 is not the same thing as 12 to 5. So we're not going to be able to-- this right over here is not a legitimate table. Table 3-- so 1 to 1. Then when you double the distance, we double the time. When you triple the distance from 1, you didn't triple the time. So table 3 doesn't seem to make sense, either. Table 4-- so 14 to 10. So that's the same thing as-- let's see, that's the same ratio as, if we were to divide by 2, as 7 to 5 ratio. If we divide both of these by 3, this is also a 7 to 5 ratio. And if you divide both of these by 7, this is also a 7 to 5 ratio. So table 4 seems like a completely reasonable scenario. And we can check our answer, and it is.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-ratio-proportion-and-unitary-method-icse
" -  What we have here is a molecular equation describing the reaction of some sodium chloride dissolved in water plus some silver nitrate, also dissolved in the water. They're going to react to form sodium nitrate, still dissolved in water, plus solid silver chloride and if you were to look at each of these compounds in their crystalline or solid form before they're dissolved in water, they each look like this. But once you get dissolved in water, and that's what this aqueous form tells us, it tells us that each of these compounds are going to get dissolved in water, they're no longer going to be in that crystalline form, crystalline form. Instead, you're going to have the individual ions disassociating. So for example, in the case of sodium chloride, the sodium is going to disassociate in the water. Sodium is a positive ion, or cation, and so it's going to be attracted to the partially negative oxygen end. Remember, water is a polar molecule. That's what makes it such a good solvent. Now, the chloride anions, similarly, are going to dissolve in water 'cause they're going to be attracted to the partially positive hydrogen ends of the water molecules and the same thing is gonna be true of the silver nitrate. Silver ... The silver ion, once it's disassociated, is going to be positive and the nitrate is a negative. It is an anion. Now, in order to appreciate this and write an equation that better conveys the disassociation of the ions, we could instead write the equation like this. This makes it a little bit clearer that look, the sodium and the chloride aren't going to be necessarily together anymore. The sodium is going to dissolve in the water, like we have here. The chloride is gonna dissolve in the water. The silver ions are going to dissolve in the water and so are the nitrate ions. So this makes it a little bit clearer and similarly on this end with the sodium nitrate stays dissolved so we can write it like this with the individual ions disassociated. But the silver chloride is in solid form. You can think of it as precipitating out of the solution. This is not ... This does not have a high solubility, so it's not going to get dissolved in the water and so we still have it in solid form. Now you might say, well which of these is better? Well it just depends what you are trying to go for. This form up here, which we see more typically, this is just a standard molecular equation. Molecular ... Molecular equation. It's in balanced form. We always wanna have our equations balanced. This right over here is known as a complete ionic equation. The complete's there because we've put in all of the ions and we're going to compare it to a net ionic equation in a second. Complete ionic equation, sometimes just known as an ionic equation. Now why is it called that? Well, 'cause we're showing the individual ions as they're disassociated in water. Now, what would a net ionic equation be? Well let's think about that a little bit. Let me free up some space. So one thing that you notice, on both sides of this complete ionic equation, you have the same ions that are disassociated in water. So for example, on the left-hand side you have the sodium that is dissolved in water and you also have on the right-hand side sodium dissolved in the water. It's not, if you think about the silver chloride being the thing that's being produced, this thing is in ionic form and dissolved form on both sides of this reaction and so you can view it as a spectator, and that's actually what it's called. It's called a spectator ion. Spectator ion. If you wanna think of it in human terms, it's kind of out there and watching the reaction happen. Its value in this reaction is, well it was part of the sodium chloride and its providing ... So the sodium chloride is providing the chloride that eventually forms the silver chloride, but the sodium is just kind of watching. Similarly, you have the nitrate. The nitrate is dissolved on the left and the nitrate is dissolved on the right. So the nitrate is also a spectator ion. So if you wanna go from a complete ionic equation to a net ionic equation, which really deals with the things that aren't spectators, well you just get rid of the spectator ions. You get rid of that. You get rid of that. You get rid of that. You get rid of that, and then you see what is left over. Well what we have leftover is we have some dissolved chloride, and we write aqueous to show that it is dissolved, plus some dissolved silver, plus some dissolved silver. Once again, to show that it's dissolved we write aqueous and if you put those two together, you are going to get some solid silver ... Solid silver chloride. And what's useful about this form, one it's more compact and it's very clear what is actually reacting, what is being used to build, and you can say hey, however you get your chloride into the solution, however you get your silver into the solution, these are the things that are going to react to form the solid. Instead of using sodium chloride, maybe you use potassium chloride and the potassium in that case would be a spectator ion. But either way your net ionic equation would be what we have here.",science_chemistry_chemical-reactions-stoichiome
" In this video, I want to talk about how we can convert repeating decimals into fractions. So let's give ourselves a repeating decimal. So let's say I had the repeating decimal 0.7. And sometimes it'll be written like that, which just means that the 7 keeps on repeating. So this is the same thing as 0.7777 and I could just keep going on and on and on forever with those 7s. So the trick to converting these things into fractions is to essentially set this equal to a variable. And we'll just show it, do it step-by-step. So let me set this equal to a variable. Let me call this x. So x is equal to 0.7, and then the 7 repeats on and on forever. Now what would 10x be? Well, let's think about this. 10x. 10x would just be 10 times this. And we could even think of it right over here. It would be, if we multiplied this times 10, you'd be moving the decimal 1 over to the right, it would be 7.777, on and on and on and on forever. Or you could say it is 7.7 repeating. Now this is the trick here. So let me make these equal to each other. So we know what x is. x is this, just 0.777 repeating forever. 10x is this. And this is another repeating thing. Now the way that we can get rid of the repeating decimals is if we subtract x from 10x. Right? Because x has all these 0.7777. If you subtract that from 7.77777, then you're just going to be left with 7. So let's do that. So let me rewrite it here just so it's a little bit neater. 10x is equal to 7.7 repeating, which is equal to 7.777 on and on forever. And we established earlier that x is equal to 0.7 repeating, which is equal to 0.777 on and on and on forever. Now what happens if you subtract x from 10x? So we're going to subtract the yellow from the green. Well, 10 of something minus 1 of something is just going to be 9 of that something. And then that's going to be equal to, what's 7.7777 repeating minus 0.77777 going on and on forever repeating? Well it's just going to be 7. These parts are going to cancel out. You're just left with 7. Or you could say these two parts cancel out. You're just left with 7. And so you get 9x is equal to 7. To solve for x, you just divide both sides by 9. Let's divide both sides by nine. I could do all three sides, although these are really saying the same thing. And you get x is equal to 7/9. Let's do another one. I'll leave this one here so you can refer to it. So let's say I have the number 1.2 repeating. So this is the same thing as 1.2222 on and on and on. Whatever the bar is on top of, that's the part that repeats on and on forever. So just like we did over here, let's set this equal to x. And then let's say 10x. Let's multiply this by 10. So 10x is equal to, it would be 12.2 repeating, which is the same thing as 12.222 on and on and on and on. And then we can subtract x from 10x. And you don't have to rewrite it, but I'll rewrite it here just so we don't get confused. So we have x is equal to 1.2 repeating. And so if we subtract x from 10x, what do we get? On the left-hand side, we get 10x minus x is 9x. And this is going to be equal to, well, the 2 repeating parts cancel out. This cancels with that. If 2 repeating minus 2 repeating, that's just a bunch of 0. So it's 12 minus 1 is 11. And you have 9x is equal to 11. Divide both sides by 9. You get x is equal to 11/9.",math_8th-engage-ny_engage-8th-module-7
" - When we observe what we call fire we have this combustion reaction going on and then we see these flames what we're really observing are the three forms of thermal energy transfer. We're observing conduction, conduction, convection, convection, convection, and thermal radiation all at the same time. So I'll do this, thermal, thermal radiation, thermal radiation. And I could say thermal conduction, thermal convection, and thermal radiation, and the word thermal is just relating to things dealing with temperature. So what is the conduction going on? Well what we have going on in the fuel for our fire, so down here the fuel for our fire we have our classic combustion reaction and I encourage you to watch the video on that in our chemistry playlist, or chemistry section if you're interested in it. But you're taking carbon molecules and their bonds and then in the presence of oxygen and some heat you have a combustion reaction producing carbon dioxide and producing water and even more energy than you put into it, so it's producing a lot of energy. And that energy is going to excite the molecules that are around it, so you have these molecules, you have these molecules that end up getting a lot of kinetic energy. And remember, temperature is proportional to average kinetic energy. And so the ones that just combusted, or the molecules right near the reaction, or maybe the ones that were part of the reaction, they're gonna have this really high, they're gonna have this really high average kinetic energy 'cause all of this energy was released from that combustion reaction. And then they're going to bump into other molecules that might not have quite as high kinetic energy, but then they're going to transfer that kinetic energy through these collisions. And we have a whole video on thermal conduction, but that's what's happening. Things with higher kinetic energy are bumping into things with lower kinetic energy and transferring some of that kinetic energy and they're transferring some of that momentum. So that is definitely happening when we look at a fire like this, that neighboring molecules are bumping into other molecules and transferring energy. Now convection, this is around the idea that hot air is less dense. So if we have a bunch of air particles here, so let's say this is the cool air up here, and it makes sense why cool air is going to be more dense than hot air. 'Cause hot air, these particles have a much higher kinetic energy and so they're gonna bump into each other and they're gonna push each other much further away and get more seperation from each other because of that high average kinetic energy. But because the hot area is less dense, this area right over here is less dense, less dense, than the white area, these might be all the same molecule, I just made them in different colors to show the less dense area and the more dense area, it is going to rise, it is going to rise. Or you can even think of it as a more dense area. The more dense area is gonna fall around it, it's gonna fall around it, or try to go under it, because it is more dense, and then the less dense area is going to rise. And by doing that, you have the hotter molecules are moving upwards and then the cold molecules can go down to maybe the source of heat, the source of heat, the source of energy right over here to get heated up more. So this right over here is, so hot air rises, let me write this, the hot, hot air rises. And when we think about it it makes room for the cool air to come down and then get heated up again. And that's what's going on in the fire here. You see the combustion reaction, combustion reaction occurs right over there, let me just hit a different color, combustion reaction is occurring in the fuel, that super hot air, it's going to rise. And that's why it looks like these flames are kind of, they're moving upwards, they're kind of flickering upwards. And you'll also see, and actually we're gonna talk about this in thermal radiation, is that they also change color as they move upwards. But this whole idea of fire moving upwards and the hot air, if you put your hand up here it's gonna be much hotter than if you were to put your hand, say, right here, even though in theory this is closer to the flame than up here and that's because the hot air, the hot air is rising and it's making room for cold air, or cooler air, I guess I could say, to come down here and be part and get heated up again, and then it would rise up again. And so this convection, this idea of the hot air rising or the cold air falling, this is another form of heat transfer. Now the last form that we're observing when we're looking at fire is thermal radiation. And this is all around the idea that if you have charged particles being accelerated they're going to release electromagnetic radiation. And so you might say, Wait, wait, charged particles, where are those being accelerated here? Well, we have these molecules that are constantly being accelerated as they bump into each other, the one that's gonna transfer kinetic energy from, let's say this one bumps into that, it's going to accelerate that in different direction and even this one might go in another direction and acceleration is a change in velocity so it could be the magnitudinal velocity or your directional velocity. So as they're colliding you have all of these accelerational charged particles, so let me write this down, you have acceleration, acceleration of charged particles, charged particles, particles, and then that releases, that releases, electromagnetic radiation, that releases electromagnetic radiation. I know what you're thinking, Wait wait, hold on a second, Sal. Okay, I can buy that we have molecules that are being accelerated, but where is this charged, where are you getting this charged particles business? Well we have to remember these molecules are made up of atoms and atoms are made up of charged particles, are made up of protons and electrons. And so as you accelerate these and the more that you accelerate these the more radiation you are going to release. And you might say, Okay, you said I'm observing that in fire, where am I observing radiation? Well just the very fact that you can see the fire, the light emitted from the fire, that is electromagnetic radiation, that is electromagnetic radiation. It's just the electromagnetic radiation in the wavelengths that your eye considers to be visible light, or that your eye considers to be light. Even the particles up here, so even the particles up here that are still quite hot, they are also emitting electromagnetic radiation because they're all bumping into each other and their electrons and their protons are all getting accelerated in different ways, they're also releasing electromagnetic radiation, but it is at a slower wavelength than your eye is capable of perceiving as light. If you had an infrared camera you would see the flames being much larger. You would see them go all the way, all the way up here. And if you were to look at the flame closely you would see down here right where the combustion reaction is happening, the flame looks blue. And that's because the blue light is higher energy light, and that's because the particles are being accelerated more down here, and then it goes from blue to kind of a white to a yellow, to a red or to an orange, to a red, and then it, to your regular eyes, it disappears. But everything, everything that has some temperature is releasing electromagnetic radiation. And you're like, Okay, well that's all fine, I can see it but how is that a form of energy transfer? Well, if you're ever sat next to a flame you will feel the heat. In fact, even if the air between you and the flame is cold you would still feel like you're getting warm. So if this is a flame right over here, so that is fire, and let's say you have cold air, cold air, let's say you're at a campfire right over here, maybe it's 30, this air right over here is 30 degrees, if you are standing right over here you would still feel heat, you would still feel like you're getting warmed up. And that's because that electromagnetic radiation is being emitted from the air particles that we perceive as fire and then that can actually excite particles on your skin and it will transfer energy to your skin and so you feel like you are actually getting warmed up. I remember once, this is kind of a strange story, but I was on the highway and there was a car on fire and I was literally, we drove to the far lane because it was on fire, we're three lanes away from it and it kind of exploded. I don't think anyone was in it, hopefully no one was in it, but I remember right when it exploded it was an intense, immediate heat that we felt through the window of the car, and that was electromagnetic radiation. That was thermal radiation being released by these accelerated particles in the air around that explosion, which we perceived as a an explosion, or fire, but then it was warming up particles on my skin.",science_ap-physics-2_ap-thermodynamics
" There are other, higher levels of regulation that occur here and I started to talk about them when I mentioned our RB protein. So, control of the cell cycle occurs on a higher level with a couple of key proteins in addition to RB. One of the main proteins we talk about that regulate on a very high level is p53. It's even got a nickname: it's the ""guardian of the genome."" It's so important, actually, that Science Magazine called it, ""the molecule of the year"" in 1993. Theobromine, the main molecule that's in chocolate, hasn't even gotten this honor yet. So it shows you how important p53 is. It's more important than chocolate. P53 will bind DNA directly to produce proteins that block the progression of the cell cycle. One of those proteins include p21. P21 will function to inhibit CDK. So the CDK will not be able to activate DNA replication or activate mitosis. RB is another protein that is associated with the function of P53, and these proteins are considered tumor suppressor genes, so RB is a protein that is produced from a tumor suppressor gene, just like p53, so I'll write that down here. These proteins are considered tumor suppressor genes... They're made from tumor suppressor genes I should rather say. These proteins are made from tumor suppressor genes, which are important to have because if they are defected, or if they have a mutation in them that makes them have loss of function, so that's an important term, (repeats) defected or if they have a loss of function, what ends up happening is that you tend to get cancer. Cancer, which I think you and I can both agree is not a good thing to have. So, it is very important to have tumor suppressor genes. To illustrate how important that is, if you look at p53, greater than 50% of tumors have a defect in p53. RB got its name because a defect in RB would lead to a tumor of the eye, known as retino-that's where you got the R- retinoblastoma, which is why these two proteins are considered tumor suppressor genes. P21 is very unusual in that it doesn't actually lead to cancer when it's defected. Instead, scientists have found that mice that are without p21 have the ability to regenerate their limbs. How weird is that?! P21 lack causes the ability to regenerate their limbs, their arms and legs. So we're all still trying to figure out exactly how some of these key proteins work. But it's important to understand that these tumor suppressor genes are essential for making sure that we regulate the cell cycle so we don't just go to the divide, divide, divide phase. We want to make sure that we only divide when it's appropriate, when a cell is ready to, or if it's even a cell that is supposed to divide in the first place. Because, as we'll see in our next couple of videos, mitosis, or cell division, requires a lot of energy and protein machinery to happen. So we need to make sure it's the right time to divide.",science_ap-biology_cell-communication-and-cell-cycle
" A lot of what you'll learn in differential equations is really just different bags of tricks. And in this video I'll show you one of those tricks. And it's useful beyond this. Because it's always good when, if maybe one day, you become a mathematician or a physicist, and you have an unsolved problem. Some of these tricks that solved simpler problems back in your education might be a useful trick that solves some unsolved problems. So it's good to see it. And if you're taking differential equations, it might be on an exam. So it's good to learn. So we'll learn about integrating factors. So let's say, we have an equation that has this form. Let's say this is my differential equation. 3xy-- I'm trying to write it neatly as possible-- plus y squared plus x squared plus xy times y prime is equal to 0. So, especially since we've covered this in recent videos, whenever you see an equation of this form where you have some function of xy, then you have another function of x and y times y prime equals 0, you said, oh, this looks like this could be an exact differential equation. And how do we test that? Well, we can take the partial derivative of this with respect to y, and we could call this function of x and y, M. So the partial of that, with respect to y, so M partial with respect to y, would be 3x plus 2y. And if this function right here, that expression right there, that's our function N, which is a function of x and y. We take the partial with respect to x, and we get that is equal to 2x plus y. And in order for this to have been an exact differential equation, the partial of this with respect to y would have to equal the partial of this with respect to x. But we see here, just by looking at these two, they don't equal each other. They're not equal. So, at least superficially, the way we looked at it just now, this is not an exact differential equation. But what if there were some factor, or I guess some function that we could multiply both sides of this equation by, that would make it an exact differential equation? So let's call that mu. So what I want to do is I want to multiply both sides of this equation by some function mu, and then see if I can solve for that function mu that would make it exact. So let's try to do that. So let's multiply both sides by mu. And just as a simplification, mu could be a function of x and y. It could be a function of x. It could be a function of just x. It could be function of just y. I'll assume it's just a function of x. You could assume it's just a function of y and try to solve it. Or you could just assume it's a function of x and y. If you assume it's a function of x and y, it becomes a lot harder to solve for. But that doesn't mean that there isn't one. So let's say that mu is a function of x. And I want to multiply it by both of these equations. So I get mu of x times 3xy plus y squared plus mu of x times x squared plus xy times y prime. And then, what's 0 times any function? Well, it's just going to be 0, right? 0 times mu of x is just going to be 0. But I did multiply the right hand side times mu of x. And remember what we're doing. This mu of x is-- when we multiply it, the goal is, after multiplying both sides of the equation by it, we should have an exact equation. So now, if we consider this whole thing our new M, the partial derivative of this with respect to y should be equal to the partial derivative of this with respect to x. So what's the partial derivative of this with respect to y? Well, if we're taking the partial with respect to y here, mu of x, which is only a function of x, it's not a function of y, it's just a constant term, right? We take a partial with respect to y. x is just a constant, or a function of x can be viewed just as a constant. So the partial of this with respect to y is going to be equal to mu of x, you could just say, times 3x plus 2y. That's the partial of this with respect to y. And what's the partial of this with respect to x? Well, here, we'll use the product rule. So we'll take the derivative of the first expression with respect to x. mu of x is no longer a constant anymore, since we're taking the partial with respect to x. So the derivative of mu of x with respect to x. Well, that's just mu prime of x, mu prime, not U. mu prime of x. mu is the Greek letter. It's for the muh sound, but it looks a lot like a U. So mu prime of x times a second expression, x squared plus xy, plus just the first expression. This is just the product rule, mu of x. Times the derivative of the second expression with respect to x. So times-- ran out of space on that line-- 2x plus y. And now for this new equation, where I multiplied both sides by mu. In order for this to be exact, these two things have to be equal to each other. So let's just remember the big picture. We're kind of saying, this is going to be exact. And now, we're going to try to solve for mu. So let's see if we can do that. So let's see, on this side, we have mu of x times 3x plus 2y. And let's subtract this expression from both sides. So it's minus mu of x times 2x plus y. You'll see a lot of these differential equation problems that get kind of hairy. They're really just a lot of algebra. And that equals-- what do we have left? I'll write it in yellow. That equals-- I'm going to run out of space. I'm going to do it a little bit lower. That equals, just this term right here. That equals mu prime of x times x squared plus xy. And let's see, if we factor out a mu of x here, we get mu of x times 3x plus 2y minus 2x minus y is equal to mu prime of x, the derivative of mu with respect to x, times x squared plus xy. Now, we can simplify this. So we get mu of x times-- what is this-- 3x minus 2x is x. 2y minus y, so x plus y, is equal to-- and I'm just going to simplify this side a little bit-- is equal to mu prime of x. Let's factor out an x here. And the reason why I'm doing that is because it seems like if I factor out an x here, I'll get an x plus y. So this is mu prime of x times x times x plus y. x times x plus y is x squared plus xy. So that's why I did it, and I have this x plus y on both sides equation, which I will now divide both sides by. So if you divide both sides by x plus y, we could maybe assume that it's not 0. That simplifies things pretty dramatically. We get mu of x is equal to mu prime of x times x. And now, just the way my brain works, I like to rewrite this expression just in our operator form, where instead of writing it mu prime of x, we could write that as d mu dx. So let's do that. So we could write mu of x is equal to d, the derivative of mu with respect to x, times x. And this is actually a separable differential equation in and of itself. It's kind of a sub-differential equation to solve our broader one. We're just trying to figure out the integrating factor right here. So let's divide both sides by x. So we get mu over x, this is just a separable equation now, is equal to d mu dx. And then, let's divide both sides by mu of x, and we get 1 over x is equal to 1 over mu. That's mu of x, I'll just write 1 over mu right now, for simplicity, times d mu dx. I'm actually going to go horizontal right here. Multiply both sides by dx, you get 1 over x dx is equal to 1 over mu of x d mu. Now, you could integrate both sides of this, and you'll get the natural log of the absolute value of x is equal to the natural log of the absolute value of mu, et cetera, et cetera. But it should be pretty clear from this that x is equal to mu, or mu is equal to x, right? They're identical. If you look at both sides of this equation there, you can just change x for mu, and it becomes the other side. So, this is obviously telling us that mu of x is equal to x. Or mu is equal to x. So we have our integrating factor. And if you want, you can take the antiderivative of both sides with the natural logs, and all of that. And you'll get the same answer. But this is just, by looking at it, by inspection, you know that mu is equal to x. Because both sides of this equation are completely the same. 1Anyway, we now have our integrating factor. 1But I am running out of time. 1So in the next video, we're now going to use this 1integrating factor. 1Multiply it times our original differential equation. 1Make it exact. 1And then solve it as an exact equation. 1I'll see you in the next video.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-differential-equations
" Shira's math test included a survey question asking how many hours students had spent studying for the test. The graph below shows the relationship between how many hours students spent studying and their score on the test. Shira drew the line below to show the trend in the data. Assuming the line is correct, what does the line slope of 15 mean? So let's see. The horizontal axis is time studying in hours. The vertical axis is scores on the test. And each of these blue dots represent the time and the score for a given student. So this student right over here spent-- I don't know, it looks like they spend about 0.6 hours studying. And they didn't do too well on the exam. They look like they got below a 45, looks like a 43 or a 44 on the exam. This student over here spent almost 4 and 1/2 hours studying and got, looks like, a 94, close to a 95 on the exam. And what Shira did is try to draw a line that tries to fit this data. And it seems like it does a pretty good job of at least showing the trend in the data. Now, slope of 15 means that if I'm on the line-- so let's say I'm here-- and if I increase in the horizontal direction by 1-- so there, I increase the horizontal direction by 1-- I should be increasing in the vertical direction by 15. And you see that. If we increase by one hour here, we increase by 15% on the test. Now, what that means is that the trend it shows is that, in general, along this trend, if someone studies an extra hour, then if we're going with that trend, then, hey, it seems reasonable that they might expect to see a 15% gain on their test. Now, let's see which of these are consistent. In general, students who didn't study at all got scores of about 15 on the test. Well, let's see. This is neither true-- these are the people who didn't study at all, and they didn't get a 15 on the test. And that's definitely not what this 15 implies. This doesn't say what the people who didn't study at all get. So this one is not true. That one is not true. Let's try this one. If one student studied for one hour more than another student, the student who studied more got exactly 15 more points on the test. Well, this is getting closer to the spirit of what the slope means. But this word ""exactly"" is what, at least in my mind, messes this choice up. Because this isn't saying that it's a guarantee that if you study an hour extra that you'll get 15% more on the test. This is just saying that this is the general trend that this line is seeing. So it's not guaranteed. For example, we could find this student here who studied exactly two hours. And if we look at the students who studied for three hours, well, there's no one exactly at three hours. But some of them-- so this was, let's see, the student who was at two hours. You go to three hours, there's no one exactly there. But there's going to be students who got better than what would be expected and students who might get a little bit worse. Notice, there's points above the trend line, and there's points below the trend line. So this ""exactly,"" you can't say it's guaranteed an hour more turns into 15%. Let's try this choice. In general, studying for one extra hour was associated with a 15-point improvement in test score. That feels about right. In general, studying for 15 extra hours was associated with a 1-point improvement in test score. Well, no, that would get the slope the other way around. So that's definitely not the case. So let's check our answer. And we got it right.",math_statistics-probability_describing-relationships-quantitative-data
" -  We've seen in previous videos that photosynthesis can be broken down into the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. And the light-dependent reactions is where we take light as an input along with water, and we'll see the water is actually a source of electrons, and we can use that to store energy in the form of ATP and NADPH, and as a by-product we produce molecular oxygen, which is very important for us to breathe. And then that ATP and that NADPH can be used in the Calvin cycle, along with carbon dioxide, to actually synthesize sugar. What we're gonna focus on in this video are the light-dependent reactions. How does this process right here work? And to help us think about this, we're going to zoom in onto a thylakoid membrane. So this is a thylakoid right over here, sitting inside of the chloroplast. And if we zoom in on its membrane, we see it's a phospholipid bilayer, like many membranes that we see in biology. And at first glance, this might seem like a very complex diagram, and that's because it is a complex diagram, and you will often see things like this in your biology textbooks. They can be very intimidating, these proteins and molecules and complexes have very complicated-sounding names, but the general idea of what's going on is, you'll hopefully find, pretty straightforward. You have the energy from light, photons from light are going to, either directly or indirectly, excite electrons. Those excited electrons, they're in a high-energy state. They're gonna be transferred from one molecule to another, and they're going to go to lower energy states. That's what allows those transfers to be as spontaneous, for them to actually occur. They're going from a high-energy state to a lower-energy state. The electrons are getting more and more and more comfortable, and some of that energy that's released as the electron goes from a high-energy state to a lower-energy state is used to pump hydrogen ions across the membrane. From the outside of the membrane, in the stroma, to the inside of the membrane, to within the thylakoid lumen. So you are building a hydrogen ion concentration gradient. Concentration gradient. Where you have a higher concentration inside than you have outside. And this by itself, this concentration gradient as we'll see, can be used to fuel the production of ATP by ATP synthase, that those hydrogen ions want to get back out. They wanna go down their concentration gradient, and as they go back out through the ATP synthase it essentially turns that motor that can jam the phosphate group onto ADP to produce ATP. So one way to think about it, this is producing a hydrogen ion gradient. So we could do it this way, we could say H plus gradient, which is then being used to produce the actual ATP. Now the electrons going from a high-energy state to a lower-energy state in this part of the light-dependent reactions, that by itself isn't the only thing that is contributing to the hydrogen ion concentration gradient. Once that electron gets donated, you might say, well how does it get replaced? Well the thing that's doing the donating, the thing that eventually gets excited and donates that electron, it's a chlorophyll a variation called P680. P680 is referring to the P stands for pigment, 680 stands for 680 o-meters, the wavelength of light that it absorbs best. And so when it gets excited, it becomes you'll see the notation off of P680*, that's when it has an excited electron. And then after it gives away its electron, it becomes P680+ with a positive charge. And this P680, we could call it P680 plus right over here, maybe a P680 ion, this is actually a very strong oxidizing agent. One of the strongest, if not the strongest, that we know in biological systems. And so it really likes to grab electrons from other things. And the thing that is around that it can grab electrons from is actually water. And so this is such a strong oxidizing agent that it can essentially oxidize the oxygen in water, and oxygen as itself. I mean, oxidizing is named after oxygen because oxygen is such a strong, it's so electronegative, it's such a strong, it's the thing that's normally doing the oxidizing. So anyway, it grabs its electrons, once it gets this P680+, grabs an electron from water, and then the water essentially falls apart so you're left just with the oxygen and then the hydrogen ions. And so those hydrogen ions also contribute to the increased hydrogen ion concentration on the inside. And this is where we get the oxygen by-product right over here. Here we have one half of an O2, so if you do this twice you're going to have a molecular oxygen. So, so far we've talked about how the oxygen gets produced, we've talked about how the ATP gets produced. What about the NADPH? Well we've started our process in photosystem II. You might say, why's it called photosystem II if that's where we start? Well it's actually that's because that's the second photosystem to be discovered. You might say, what is a photosystem? Well these photosystems and complexes, they're combinations of proteins and molecules, and photosystem in particular has chlorophyll and variations of chlorophyll and pigment molecules that are responsive to light that are very easy, that have electrons that can get excited by light, and they can transfer that energy back down to the P680 chlorophyll a pair, which then can have its electron excited and then it can give that to an acceptor molecule and then it can go to lower, lower energy states and pump those hydrogen ions out. But that's not the entire light-dependent reactions. That electron can eventually make its way over to photosystem I, and why's it called photosystem I? Well it's because the first one that was discovered. In photosystem I, there's another chlorophyll a pair called P700, and that's because it optimally absorbs light of a wavelength of 700 o-meters. And you have something similar that happens, that light can either directly or indirectly excite its electron. And then that electron, as it goes to a lower-energy level, it goes from one molecule to another, it can be used to reduce NADP+ into NADPH. And so that's where the NADPH comes from. And then once again, once the P700 has given its electron, it wants an electron, and well it can get that from the electron that's been going from lower to lower, lower energy states, that's essentially been making its way from, you can conceptualize it as the electron that's been making its way from photosystem II. And so that's why you'll often see these diagrams. Lights come in, electron gets energized, it gets excited, it goes to lower and lower energy states. As it's doing that it's being transferred from one molecule to another, being facilitated by enzymes. That energy, part of that energy is being used to transfer hydrogen ions into the thylakoid lumen, into the interior. Then in photosystem I, you have another excitation event. That thing that got excited can grab that electron that went to lower, lower energy states, and its excited electron can once again be transferred from one molecule to another in order to fuel or provide energy for NADP+ being converted into NADPH. And once again the whole idea of the hydrogen ion concentration increasing here can fuel ATP synthase, which allows us to jam a phosphate onto ADP to produce ATP. So that is where we actually get all of these things and the by-product of course is our oxygen. And if you wanted to see that same idea but kind of just thinking from an energetic point of view without all of the complexity of seeing the physical components involved, you see it right over here. Where you have light energy comes, excites the electrons. Once the P680 has given that electron away, it wants an electron really badly. It gets it from the water. And then as that electron goes to lower and lower and lower energy states, it can eventually be grabbed by P700 that has given away its own electron. And then that electron that was excited at P700 by, once again, more light energy, that can be transferred from one molecule to another to fuel the creation of NADPH. And this part right over here, this phase right over here, as the energy goes from a high-energy state to a- as the electron goes from a high-energy state to a lower energy state, fuels the pumping of hydrogen protons into the actual thylakoid.",science_biology_photosynthesis-in-plants
" -  We've done many videos on Khan Academy on evolution and natural selection explaining them, but I thought I would do a video going a little bit more in depth in evidence for evolution and natural selection. And I started with this quote ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution."" This is by Theodus Dobzhansky, who's a famous biologist, he's passed away now, and what he's saying is absolutely true and this is why it's so important to appreciate the evidence for evolution and natural selection and to understand them, because before the theory of evolution, biology was just about observation and classification without having a cohesive narrative for how all of this came about. And since Darwin had come up with this theory in the mid-19th century, we've had far more tools to back it up beyond just the observations we had up until that point. We have our tools around dating and the fossil record, which gives us much more evidence. We have our tools of microbiology and genetics, which gives us even stronger evidence, so a lot of times people say ""Oh, it's a theory, evolution ""is it just a theory?"" Well, it's about as strong as theories get and without it, as Theodus Dobzhansky said, biology as we know it and all of the progress we've made in biology frankly wouldn't make any sense and probably would not have happened. Now I'm going to broadly go into three types of evidence in this video for evolution and natural selection. The first is structural. And these are the types of things that folks like Darwin would have observed, that people have been observing in biology for a long time but evolution and natural selection starts to make a lot more sense of it, and here we're talking about the macro structure, things that we can for the most part observe with our eyes or with a very simple microscope. The next level is what we've learned, really over the last 100 or so years, at the micro level, in microbiology. Microbiology and especially in genetics. So this has really firmed up the theory of evolution. And then the last dimension we'll look at is direct observation, direct observation, and this is really where it goes beyond a theory. We are seeing it happen. A lot of times people say ""Oh, it's a theory, ""you know, the theory says it happened over tens ""of millions of years but no one was around to really ""observe, even if we see a lot of evidence, no one ""knows if it for sure happened."" But if you're directly observing things, well you know it's for sure happening and as we'll see, evolution does not only occur over time scales of millions or tens of millions of years, it actually can occur and we see it occurring all the time on scales well within a human observational capacity, within just a matter of months or years. So let's go through each of these. So first let's talk about structural and this is a very high-level overview. I encourage you to do more research on it. You will find loads and loads and loads of any type of this evidence. So the first thing I want to talk about is homologous structures, homologous structures, that you see throughout the biological world. Hom-ol-o-gous, homologous structures. And the word homologous means things that have similar structure, similar position, similar ancestry but not necessarily the exact same function. And here you see examples of a, well as a human, we would consider a forearm. You see the human forearm and wrist and then you see the homologous structures in dogs and birds and whales. And even though this part of those animals have very different functions, a human does not walk on its hands for the most part; a dog does walk on its front legs; a bird isn't walking at all, it's using them to flap its wings; and a whale, this is making up its actual fins, it's using them to propel or to control their movement inside of the water. And even though they have these very, very different functions and at first when you look at a human and a bird and a whale on the outside, they might look reasonably different, when you look at these bone structures, they are eerily similar, especially color-coded the way it is. So these are, this is a very strong hint that maybe humans, dogs, birds, and whales share a common ancestor, more recently in the past than say other animals or organisms, I should say, that don't have, whose structures aren't as homologous as these are right over here. And if you were independently trying to create structures for what each of these different species are doing, it's not obvious that you would have such homologous structures actually be involved. Now these are all species that exist today, these are all species that exist on the planet at the same time, but we also see structural evidence by going into the fossil record. In the last few hundred years, or early in the last hundred years is where we've gotten really good at it, we've gotten good at looking at different layers of rock strata and being able to date them and say ""Okay, that layer was laid down x-million ""years ago, that layer was laid down a little bit ""more recent, this one was even more recent,"" and then looking at fossils within that to say ""Okay, 20 million years ago there were species ""around that looked something like that, ""and then 10 million years ago there were species ""that looked like that."" And one example is if you look at a horse-like animal. So this is right over here, we're talking about horses, zebras, donkeys, mules, things like that, the modern ones, well this is their bone structure but if you look at the fossil record from 12 to 5 million years ago, you see fossils that look like this and they're very close so you see, it's very believable that you could have evolution from this to that, but then you go further back and once again, it draws, it seems like a very gradual process. And once again, this happening over, these are from 12 to 5 million years ago, these are from 16 to 12 million years ago, these are from over 34 million years ago. And so you can see how this is happening at a very, very gradual pace and the mechanism, and we go into some depth in other videos in Khan Academy, you have variation in species, you have the environment selecting for it. The environment might change or different things happen so you have different forms of selection, different types of combinations sprout up, they're more suitable for the environment, they start to reproduce better, they become the domit species or they take over certain parts of a niche or an ecosystem, and so you have this change, this heritable change of traits over time. And so when you look at the fossil record, it makes a lot of sense that, okay, this is strong evidence for evolution, that the animals that we see today weren't just put on, just created all of a sudden and haven't changed since then, but there's a constant change and we can see it directly through the fossil record. Now the next point of evidence, I will put a bit of a caveat because the gentleman who first created this, his name was Haeckel, he was a controversial figure, he had some spurious theories, and even this diagram that he created, it seems like he fudged a little bit of the drawings in order to make a stronger argument, but even with modern observations, these drawings are pretty close to being correct. And it's very, very compelling. It shows the embryonic development of a whole series of species, from a fish on the left to a reptile to birds to mammals and another mammal, to non-human mammals and, of course, to humans. And you can see at the early stages, they look eerily similar. In fact, you see proto gill slits in all of these animals, which later differentiate into things that are more suitable for what that animal actually becomes. And Haeckel, he's the guy who claimed ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, which is a very fancy way of saying that your embryonic development is telling the story of the evolutionary path, which isn't true, but you'll even hear people quote that today. But his drawings and his observations, this is compelling evidence for life sharing a common ancestry, coming from similar origins that got more and more different over time through the process of natural selection. So everything I've talked about so far has been kind of macro structure, things we can observe. The next thing I'm gonna talk about is, you can think about as micro structures or processes, and this is microbiology. Microbiology... Biolo, biology... Microbiology. And the more we understand about microbiology the more compelling case of evolution because when we look at even one, all life forms that we know, they involve DNA. How the DNA gets replicated and translated and transcribed is very similar from one life form to another. The idea of DNA going to, DNA coding for proteins, proteins, that are made up of amino acids is something that we see throughout biology. Amino acids, which once again hints at a common ancestry. And not only are those molecular and many of the very proteins are very, very similar, more similar than if you look at the macro level or even at the structural level between different species, and not just do they share these common microstructures and processes, but the actual information stored in things like DNA also are very, very strong evidence for evolution. So this is a picture, I got this from, I got this from the site, I should give proper credit, 23andme.com. But this and you'll see other data like this 1that's very similar to this, which is how much 1genetic similarity do we have between different 1species, and these numbers tell us how much genetic 1similarity at a high level do we have with 1chimpanzees, mice, fruit flies, yeast, and plants. 1And the fact that we have 26% of our genes 1in common with yeast is mind-blowing because 1at a macro level it doesn't seem like there's 1a lot in common with yeast, but when you get 1at a microbiological level, there's a good bit 1that's in common with yeast. 1And chimpanzees, we do relate to them, their facial 1expressions often feel eerily human, their behaviors 1often feel eerily human, but their genes, so just 1how close to human beings they actually are. 1And this actually shows that even mice are way 1closer, if you look at the entire tree of life 1based on genetic evidence, things like mice 1and even fruit flies are awfully close to human 1beings, especially if you were to compare it 1to bacteria or a plant. 1But once again, you share all of these common 1processes and the fact that we can now measure 1how far things are away allows us to create 1a very accurate tree of life, and especially 1thinking about how far in the past we had 1evolutionary common ancestors. 1Now the last thing that I promised I would talk 1about is direct evidence, direct evidence 1of evolution, and I talk about this in the first 1evolution video, but the direct evidence we see 1all the time with things like bacteria where 1you have bacteria, let's say growing around, 1and we have antibiotics that we use in our body 1to kill bacteria, but the reason why many 1physicians and scientists will tell you ""Don't 1""overuse antibiotics"" is because the more you use 1it, it causes a very strong natural selection 1process for bacteria that are going to be resistant 1to that antibiotic. 1So if you keep using an antibiotic and the bacterias 1keep changing, there's more and more variation, 1well you're gonna kill a lot of the bacteria 1but if even one of them is resistant to that 1antibiotic that you use, well then all of its 1competition is gonna get killed and so that 1drug-resistant superbug, it's often called, is going 1to be able to go nuts and that antibiotic isn't 1going to be able to do anything. 1And if you look at science today or you look 1at medicine today, this is kind of an arms race. 1You have this constant need to create new 1antibiotics because more and more bacteria are 1becoming drug-resistant, they're becoming what's 1often called superbugs, where they are resistant 1to the existing antibiotics. 1And this is evolution, natural selection, 1happening on a human scale. 1You could also think about the flu virus where every 1year that vaccine for the flu virus, you gotta get 1a new one every year because the virus is changing. 1Your immune system's ability to recognize it can't 1recognize the next year's because it's changed so much.",science_biology_her
" -  Let's say we're going to trace out a curve where our X coordinate and our Y coordinate that they are each defined by or they're functions of a third parameter T. So, we could say that X is a function of T and we could also say that Y is a function T. If this notion is completely unfamiliar to you, I encourage you to review the videos on parametric equations on Khan Academy. But what we're going to think about and I'm gonna talk about in generalities in this video. In future videos we're going to be dealing with more concrete examples but we're gonna think about what is the path that is traced out from when T is equal to A, so this is where we are when T is equal to A, so in this case this point would be X of A, comma Y of A, that's this point and then as we increase from T equals A to T is equal to B, so our curve might do something like this, so this is when T is equal to B, T is equal to B, so this point right over here is X of B, comma Y of B. Let's think about how do we figure out the length of this actual curve, this actual arc length from T equals A to T equals B? Well, to think about that we're gonna zoom in and think about what happens when we have a very small change in T? So, a very small change in T. Let's say we're starting at this point right over here and we have a very small change in T, so we go from this point to let's say this point over that very small change in T. It actually would be much smaller than this but if I drew it any smaller, you would have trouble seeing it. So, let's say that that is our very small change in our path in our arc that we are traveling and so, we wanna find this length. Well, we could break it down into how far we've moved in the X direction and how far we've moved in the Y direction. So, in the X direction, the X direction right over here, we would have moved a very small change in X and what would that be equal to? Well, that would be the rate of change with which we are changing with respect to T with which X is changing with respect to T times our very small change in T and this is a little hand wavy, I'm using differential notion and I'm conceptually using the idea of a differential as an infinitesimally small change in that variable. And so, this isn't a formal proof but it's to give us the intuition for how we derive arc length when we're dealing with parametric equations. So, this will hopefully make conceptual sense that this is our DX. In fact, we could even write it this way, DX/DT, that's the same thing as X prime of T times DT and then our change in Y is going to be the same idea. Our change in Y, our infinitesimally small change in Y when we have an infinitesimally small change in T, well, you could view that as your rate of change of Y with respect to T times your change in T, your very small change in T which is going to be equal to, we could write that as Y prime of T DT. Now, based on this, what would be the length of our infinitesimally small arc length right over here? Well, that we could just use the Pythagorean theorem. That is going to be the square root of, that's the hypotenuse of this right triangle right over here. So, it's gonna be the square root of this squared plus this squared. So, it is the square root of, I'm gonna give myself a little bit more space here because I think I'm gonna use a lot of it, so the stuff in blue squared, DX squared we could rewrite that as X prime of T DT squared plus this squared which is Y prime of T DT squared and now let's just try to simplify this a little bit. Remember, this is this infinitesimally small arc length right over here. So, we can actually factor out a DT squared, it's a term in both of these and so, we can rewrite this as, let me, so I can rewrite this and then write my big radical sign, so I'm gonna factor out a DT squared here, so we could write this as DT squared times X prime of T squared plus Y prime of T squared and then to be clear this is being multiplied by all of this stuff right over there. Well, now if we have this DT squared under the radical, we can take it out and so, we will have a DT and so, this is all going to be equal to the square root of, so the stuff that's still under the radical is going to be X prime of T squared plus Y prime of T squared and now we took out a DT and now we took out a DT. I could have written it right over here but I'm just writing it on the other side, we're just multiplying the two. So, this is once again just rewriting the expression for this infinitesimally small change in arc length. Well, what's lucky for us is in calculus we have the tools for adding up all of these infinitesimally small changes and that's what the definite integral does for us. So, what we can do if we wanna add up that plus that plus that plus that and remember, these are infinitesimally small changes. I'm just showing them as not infinitesimally just so that you can kind of think about them but if you were to add them all up, then we are essentially taking the integral and we're integrating with respect to T and so, we're starting at T is equal to A, all the way to T is equal to B and just like that we have been able to at least feel good conceptually for the formula of arc length when we're dealing with parametric equations. In the next few videos we'll actually apply it to figure out arc lengths.",math_calculus-2_cs2-parametric-equations-polar-coordinates-and-vector-valued-functions
" Over which interval does y of x have an average rate of change of negative 4? So average rate of change, if you think about it, you are literally just averaging for example, in this bowl section right over here. The slope is really, really steep. It gets less steep. It's a very negative slope, it gets less negative. Less negative slope is 0 here. Then it gets positive, more positive, and more positive, and more positive. But when you get to this point right over here, you see you got to where you started from. One you could say the net change has been 0. And any interval over which the net change has been 0 also tells you that the average rate of change is going to be 0. So you could view that the average rate of change is really the slope of the line that connects the two endpoints of your interval. So another way of asking over which interval does y of x have an average rate of change of negative 4 is, can you come up with an interval where the slope between the endpoints of the interval is negative 4? So let's see the choices they give us. This first interval is x is between negative 1 and 1. So x is between negative 1. So this is x is negative 1. When x is equal to negative 1, y of x is all the way over here. y of negative 1 is equal to 7. And then when x is equal to 1, our graph is down over here. y of 1 is negative 1. So what is the slope of the line that connects the endpoints of those two points? So what is the slope of this line? Because the slope of this line, the line that connects the endpoints of my interval, that is going to be the average rate of change over this interval. And you see very clearly that the slope here, the rate of change of y with respect to x is negative 4. Every time we move one ahead in the x direction, we move down four in the y direction. Move one ahead in the x direction, we move down four in the y direction. So the average rate of change over this interval is negative 4. So we didn't have to even look at anything else, that one will work.",math_math1_functions
" -  A company screens job applicants for illegal drug use at a certain stage in their hiring process. The specific test they use has a false positive rate of two percent and a false negative rate of one percent. Suppose that five percent of all their applicants are actually using illegal drugs and we randomly select an applicant. Giving the applicant test positive, what is the probability that they are actually on drugs? So let's work through this together. So first let's make sure we understand what they're telling us. So there is this drug test for the job applicants and then the test has a false positive rate of two percent. What does that mean? That means that in two percent of the cases, when it should have read negative, that the person didn't do the drugs, it actually read positive. It is a false positive. It should have read negative but it read positive. Another way to think about it. If someone did not do drugs and you take this test, there's a two percent chance saying that you did do the illegal drugs. They also say that there is a false negative rate of one percent. What does that mean? That means that one percent of the time if someone did actually take the illegal drugs, it'll say that they didn't. It is falsely giving a negative result when it should have given a positive one. And then they say that five percent of all their applicants are actually using illegal drugs. So there is several ways that we can think about it. One of the easiest way to conceptualize is just, let's just make up a large number of applicants, and I'll use a number where it's fairly straightforward to do the mathematics. So let's say that we start of with 10,000 applicants. I will both talk in absolute numbers, and I just made this number up. It could have been 1,000, it could have been 100,000, but I like this number 'cause it's easy to do the math better than saying 9,785. This is also going to be 100% of the applicants. Now they give us some crucial information here. They tell us that five percent of all their applicants are actually using illegal drugs. So we can immediately break this 10,000 group into the ones that are doing the drugs and the ones that are not. So five percent are actually on the drugs, 95% are not on the drugs. So what's five percent of 10,000? So that would be 500. So 500 on drugs, on drugs. Once again, this is five percent of our original population. And then how many are not on drugs? Well 9,500 not on drugs. And once again, this is 95% of our group of applicants. So now let's administer the test. So what is going to happen when we administer the test to the people who are on drugs? Well the test, ideally, would give a positive result. It would say positive for all of them, but we know that it's not a perfect test. It's going to give negative for some of them. It will falsely give a negative result for some of them, and we know that because it has a false negative rate of one percent. Of these 500, 99% is going to get the correct result in that they're going to test positive. So what is 99% of 500? Well let's see, that would be 495. 495 are going to test positive. I will just use a positive right over there. And then we're going to have one percent, which is five, are going to test negative. They are going to falsely test negative. This is the false negative rate. If we say, what percent of our original applicant pool is on drugs and tests positive, well 495 over 10,000. This is 4.95%. What percent is of the original applicant pool that is on drugs but tests negative for drugs? The test says that hey they're not doing drugs. Well this is gonna be five out of 10,000. Which is 0.05%. Another way that you could get these percentages. If you take five percent and multiply by one percent, you're goin to get 0.05%. 500ths of a percent. If you take five percent and multiply by 99%, you're going to get 4.95%. Now let's keep going. Now let's go to the folks who aren't taking the drugs. And this is where the false positive rate is going to come into effect. So we have a false positive rate of two percent. So two percent are going to test positive. What's two percent of 9,500? It's 190 would test positive even though they're not on drugs. This is the false positive rate. So they are testing positive, and then the other 98% will correctly come out negative. The other 98%, so 9,500 minus 190, that's gonna be 9,310 will correctly test negative. Now what percent of the original applicant pool is this? Well 190 is 1.9%, and we could calculate it by 190 over 10,000 or you could just say two percent of 95% is 1.9%. Once again, multiply the path along the tree. What percent is 9.310? Well that is going to be 93.10%. You could say this is 9,310 over 10,000 or you can multiply by the path on our probability tree here. 95% times 98% gets us to 93.10%. But now I think we are ready to answer the question. Given that the applicant tests positive, what is the probability that they are actually on drugs? So let's look at the first part. Given the applicant tests positive. So which applicants actually tested positive? You have these 495 here tested positive, correctly tested positive, and then you have these 190 right over here incorrectly tested positive, but they did test positive. So how many tested positive? Well we have 495 plus 190 tested positive. That's the total number that tested positive, and then which of them were actually on the drugs? Well of the ones that tested positive, 495 were actually on the drugs. We have 495 divided by 495 plus 190 is equal to 0.7226. So we could say approximately 72%. Approximately 72%. Now this is really interesting. Given the applicant tests positive, what is the probability that they are actually on drugs? When you look at these false positive and false negative rates, they seem quite low, but now when you actually did the calculation, the probability that someone's actually on drugs is, it's high, but it's not that high. It's not like if someone were to test positive that you'd say oh they are definitely taking the drugs. And you could also get to this result just by using the percentages. For example, you could think in terms of what percentage of the original applicants end up testing positive? Well that's 4.95% plus 1.9%. 4.95, we'll just do it in terms of percent, plus 1.9%, and of them, what percentage were actually on the drugs? Well that was the 4.95%. And notice this would give you the exact same result. Now there's an interesting takeaway here. Because this is saying, of the people that test positive, 72% are actually on the drugs. You could think about it the other way around. Of the people who test positive. 495 plus 190, what percentage aren't on drugs? Well that was 190, and this comes out to be approximately 28%. 100% minus 72%. If we were in a court of law and let's say the prosecuting attorney, let's say I got tested positive for drugs and the prosecuting attorney says look, this test is very good. It only has a false positive rate of two percent and Sal tested positive, he is probably taking drugs. A jury who doesn't really understand this well or go through the trouble that we just did might say, oh yeah Sal probably took the drugs. But when we look at this, even if I test positive using this test, there's a 28% chance that I'm not taking drugs. That I was just in this false positive group, 1and the reason why this number is a good bit larger 1than this number 1is because when we looked at the original division 1between those who take drugs and don't take drugs, 1most don't take the illegal drugs. 1Two percent of this larger group 1of the ones that don't take the drugs, 1well this is actually a fairly large number 1relative to the percentage that do take the drugs 1and test positive. 1So I will leave you there. 1This is fascinating not just for this particular case, 1but you will see analysis like this all the time 1when we're looking at whether a certain medication 1is effective or a certain procedure is effective. 1It's important to be able to do this analysis.",math_ap-statistics_probability-ap
" -  So what we have here is a circle with the center at Point O, and then we have a tangent line to the circle. Let me actually label this line. Let's call this Line L. And we see at Point A is the point that the tangent line intersects with the circle, and then we've drawn a radius from the center of the circle to Point A. Now what we want to do in this video is prove to ourselves that this radius and that this tangent line intersect at a right angle. We want to prove to ourselves that they intersect at a right angle. And the first step to doing that is we're going to feel good, we're going to prove to ourselves that Point A is the closest point on Line L to the center of our circle. So I want to prove, prove that Point A is closest, closest point on L to Point O. To Point O. And I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can prove that to yourself. Well, to think about that, just think about any other point on Line L. Pick any other arbitrary point on Line L. It could be this point right over here. It could be this point right over here. It could be this point right over here. And you immediately see that it sits outside of the circle. And if it's sitting outside of the circle, I'll pick this point here, just so it'll become a little bit clearer on our diagram, if it's sitting outside of the circle, in order to get from Point O to this point, I'm going to call this Point B right over here, you have to go the length of the radius, you have to go the length of the radius, and then you have to go some more. So this length, the length of Segment O B, is clearly going to be longer than the length of the radius, because you have to go to the radius to get to the circle itself and then you have to go a little bit further for any point that sits outside of the circle. So Point A is the only point, by definition this is a tangent line, it's the only point that sits on the circle. Every other point on Line L sits outside of the circle, so it's going to be further. So Point A, hopefully this makes you feel good, because you pick any other point, it's going to sit outside of the circle, so you have to go to the radius and then some. So hopefully this makes you feel good that Point A is the closest point on L to the center of the circle. Now, we're not done yet, we now have to convince ourselves that if we have a point and a line, that the segment connecting the point to the closest point on the line, to that original point, that, that's going to be perpendicular to the line. So let me give ourselves some space here. We want to prove, we want to prove that if we, that the segment, segment connecting, connecting a point off the line, off the line, and closest point on the line, closest point on the line, is perpendicular, is perpendicular to the line. So what we want to do, is we want to say, hey, if we have some line here, if we have some line here, L, and if you were to take a point off the line, so let's say, so you wanted a point off the line, so let's say that, that's this point right over here, Point O, and you want the segment connecting the point off the line to the closest point on the line. So the closest point on the line, so let's say that this is the closest point on the line, we want to feel good that this segment connecting them, so let me do this in a new color, that the segment connecting them is going to be perpendicular to the line, that it goes just straight down like that, that it's going to be perpendicular. And I'm gonna prove this by contradiction. I'm going to assume that it's not perpendicular. So assume, assume that the segment, segment connecting, connecting, this is kind of wordy, a point off line and closest point to the line, closest point to line, is not, is not perpendicular to the line. So how can I visualize that? Well, I could draw my line right over here. So that's Line L, and let's say I have my Point O right over here. Point O, and let's say the closest point on Line L to Point O, let's say that it's not, so let's say it's over here, that if I were to connect these two points, that it's not perpendicular to Line L. So this is the closest point, let's call this Point A, and let's say that the segment connecting these two is not perpendicular to the line. So let me get, so let's assume this is not perpendicular. So this angle, this angle, this angle right here, is not, is not 90 degrees. So if we assume that, the reason that this is going to be a proof by contradiction is I can show that if this is not 90 degrees, that I can always find a point that is going to be closer, another point on Line L that is going to be closer to Point O, which contradicts the fact that this was supposed to be the closest point, A was supposed to be the closest point on Line L to O. And how do I always find a closer point? Well, I construct a right triangle. I can construct a right triangle, just like this. I can construct a right triangle like that, and we see that this distance, let's call this distance right over here a, and we could call the base of this triangle b, let me do this in a different color. So a, b, that's the base of the right triangle, and the hypotenuse is the distance from O to A. We could call that c. We know from the Pythagorean Theorem that a squared plus b squared, plus b squared, let me do this, plus b squared, is going to be equal to c squared. Is going to be equal to c squared. And so b squared, if we have a non-degenerate triangle right over here, this is going to be some positive value over here, and so a is going to be less than c. So this gets us to the conclusion, because if this is some positive value here, and a and c are positive, everything are positive distances, then this tells us that a has to be less than c. That a non-hypotenuse side of a right triangle, of a non-degenerate right triangle, assuming it has some area, is going to be shorter than the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the longest side. So a is going to be less than c, which would tell us, if a is less than c, that we've found another point, let's call this point, I don't know, I've used a lot of letters here, let's call that Point D. D is going to be closer. D is closer. D is closer. So we've just set up a contradiction. We assumed A was the closest point on Line L to Point O, but we assumed the segment connecting them is not at a 90-degree angle. If it's not at a 90-degree angle, then we can drop a perpendicular and find a closer point, which is a contradiction to the fact that A was supposed to be the closer point. So this leads to a contradiction. Contradiction. Contradiction. Because you can actually find that this is not the closest point, you can always find a closer point, so therefore, the segment connecting a point off the line to the closest point to the line must be perpendicular. Must be perpendicular. So the segment connecting a point off the line, to a closest point on the line, that must be perpendicular to the line. Must be perpendicular to the line. And just like that, we hopefully feel good about the idea that if you have a radius, and the point at which it intersects a tangent line to the circle, that, that forms a 90-degree angle. The radius and the tangent line.",math_geometry-home_cc-geometry-circles
" Where we left off, we were trying our very best to get to the castle and save whomever we were needing to save. But we had to cross the bridge and the troll gave us these clues because we had no money in our pocket. And if we don't solve his riddle, he's going to push us into the water. So we are under pressure. And at least we made some headway in the last video. We were able to represent his clues mathematically as a system of equations. What I want to do in this video is think about whether we can solve for this system of equations. And you'll see that there are many ways of solving a system of equations. But this time I want to do it visually. Because at least in my mind, it helps really get the intuition of what these things are saying. So let's draw some axes over here. Let's draw an f-axis. That's the number of fives that I have. And let's draw a t-axis. That is the number of tens I have. And let's say that this right over here is 500 tens. That is 1,000 tens. And let's say this is-- oh, sorry, that's 500 fives. That's 1,000 fives. This is 500 tens, And this is 1,000 tens. So let's think about all of the combinations of f's and t's that satisfy this first equation. If we have no tens, then we're going to have 900 fives. So that looks like it's right about there. So that's the point 0 tens, 900 fives. But what if went the other way? If we have no fives, we're going to have 900 tens. So that's going to be the point 900 tens, 0 fives. So all the combinations of f's and t's that satisfy this are going to be on this line right over there. And I'll just draw a dotted line just because it's easier for me to draw it straight. So that represents all the f's and t's that satisfy the first constraint. Obviously, there's a bunch of them, so we don't know which is the one that is actually what the troll has. But lucky for us, we have a second constraint-- this one right over here. So let's do the same thing. In this constraint, what happens if we have no tens? If tens are 0, then we have 5f is equal to 5,500. Let me do a little table here, because this is a little bit more involved. So for the second equation, tens and fives. If I have no tens, I have 5f is equal to 5,500, f will be 1,100. I must have 1,100 fives. If I have no fives, then this is 0, and I have 10t is equal to 5,500, that means I have 550 tens. So let's plot both at those point. t equals 0, f is 11. That's right about there. So that is 0. 1,100 is on the line that represents this equation. And that when f is 0, t is 550. So let's see, this is about-- this would be 6, 7, 8, 9, so 550 is going to be right over here. So that is the point 550 comma 0. And all of these points-- let me try to draw a straight line again. I could do a better job than that. So all of these points are the points-- let me try one more time. We want to get this right. We don't want to get pushed into the water by the troll. So there you go. That looks pretty good. So every point on this blue line represents an ft combination that satisfies the second constraint. So what is an f and t, or number of fives and number of tens that satisfy both constraints? Well, it would be a point that is sitting on both of the lines. And what is a point that is sitting on both of the lines? Well, that's where they intersect. This point right over here is clearly on the blue line and is clearly on the yellow line. And what we can do is, if we drew this graph really, really precisely, we could see how many fives that is and how many tens that is. And if you look at it, if you look at very precisely, and actually I encourage you to graph it very precisely and come up with how many fives and how many tens that is. Well, when we do it right over here, I'm going to eyeball it. If we look at it right over here, it looks like we have about 700 fives, and it looks like we have about 200 tens. And this is based on my really rough graph. But let's see if that worked. 700 plus 200 is equal to 900. And if I have 700 fives-- let me write this down. 5 times 700 is going to be the value of the fives, which is $3,500. And then 10 plus 10 times 200, which is $2,000, $2,000 is the value of the 10s. And if you add up the two values, you indeed get to $ 5,500 So this looks right. And so we can tell the troll-- Troll! I know! I know how many $5 and $10 bills you. You have 700 $5 bills, and you have 200 $10 bills. The troll is impressed, and he lets you cross the bridge to be the hero or heroine of this fantasy adventure.",math_algebra-home_alg-system-of-equations
" -  At this point, you are likely already familiar with the idea of rounding. Probably, you have had some practice rounding to the nearest 10. Now we're gonna do another type of rounding. We are now going to round to the nearest 100. So let's just start with an example, and you'll see that in a lot of ways, it's very similar to rounding to the nearest 10, we're just looking at different place values now. So let's say we have the number 345. And we want to round this to the nearest 100. So pause this video, and see, I know I haven't even taught you how to do that, but what's your intuition? What is the nearest 100 to 345? Okay, now let's do this together. And what we wanna do is first look at the 100s place. And you can see 345 is three 100s, four 10s, and five ones. So 345, the 100, the number of 100s, that is right below 345 is three 100s, so it's between three 100s, zero 10s, and zero ones, and then the number of 100s that's right above this number is 400. We're in between three 100s and four 100s. And 400. So if we're gonna round this to the nearest 100, it's gonna go to one of these two. Well, to think about which one we round to, we have to think about well, is 345 closer to 400, or is it closer to 300? And to think about that, we can draw ourselves a number line. And so let me just start my number line here at, I'll just start it at 200. So that's 200, let's make this 300, and then this would be 400. And then since we, let's just see, this would be about 350 right over here, so I'll do the 50s right over there. So that 350. So where would 345 sit? Well, 345 is a little bit less than 350. It's going to be roughly right over there. So which 100 is it closer to? Are we closer to 300, or are we closer to 400? Well, you can visually see, 350 is right in between. It's 50 away from 300, and 50 away from 400. So 345 is going to be a little bit closer to 300. So in this situation, if we're rounding to the nearest 100, we would round down to 300. Now another way that you could do this, and it's very similar to what we thought about when we rounded to the nearest 10, is okay, we're rounding to the nearest 100, so this is either going to be rounded to a three or a four, and to decide on that, we go to one place value less than that. So to decide on that, we would go to the 10s place. Let me do this in a different color. Go to the 10s place. And in our 10s place right over here, if this is less than five, then we round down. If it is greater than or equal to five, we round up. So in this situation, it is less than five, so we round down. If this was 365, well then that would be greater than or equal to five, so then we would round up. And that makes sense, because 365 would be over here, and it would be closer to 400. Let's do another example. We'll do it both with what I just described, and we'll do it with a number line. And I'll actually do a four digit number now, just to just mix things up a little bit. Let's say we have the number 7,652. Pause this video, and see if you can round this number to the nearest 100. Alright, now let's do it together. Now, we're thinking about the 100s place, so right over there. You can view this as seven thousands and six 100s. Or you could even view this as 76 100s. So what are the closest 100s to this number? Well, this is, you could either view this as 76 100s and five 10s and two ones, or seven thousands, six 100s, five 10s, and two ones. And so either way, the 100s that are right below this is 76 100s, or 7,600, and the 100s that are right above this, well you would just take one more than this six, so that would be 7700, 7700. And so, which one would it round to? Well, we could use the technique that I just showed you. You go one place value less than the 100s, which in this case is in the 10s position, and you would say, alright, is this greater than or equal to five? If it is, we round up. Is this less than five? Then we round down. This is greater than or equal to five. It's equal to five. So in this situation, we round up to 7700. And we can see that on a number line as well. Let me draw a number line here. And so let me just start at, let's say that this is 7500, this is 7600, or 7,600, and this right over here is 7,700. And this would be 7,650 right over here. And so 7,652 is going to be a little bit more than that. It's going to be a little bit more. And since you can see, it's either right in the middle, or to the right of right in the middle, we would round up to 7700, which is exactly what we just did. Now let me give you another interesting example. Let's say we wanted to round to the nearest 100 for 982. What would that be? Well once again, we look at the 100s place. Well what's 100 that's right below 982? Well if you just get rid of the 82, you're just left with nine 100s, so that would be 900 if you round down. And if you were to round up, what's the 100s right above this? Well, you could go from nine 100s to 10 100s, and that would be the same thing as 1,000. And so I wanted to show this example because when you're rounding up here, the next 100 is 10 100s, or 1,000. And so we can see very clearly here that if we look at the 10s place, the eight is greater than or equal to five, so we are going to round up. So 982 rounded to the nearest 100s is 1,000.",math_in-in-class-3rd-math-cbse_imp-addition-and-subtraction
" -  In 1865, Mendel, often considered the father of modern genetics, comes up with a structured way of thinking about these inheritable factors, which we now call ""genes."" And then as we go into the early 1900's, his work was rediscovered, and people started to say, ""Okay, we see how some ""of these traits get passed on in these ""somewhat predictable ways, we can put ""some structure around it, but what is ""the actual biological mechanism for that? ""How are these traits encoded at a cellular, ""or at a molecular level?"" And so, in 1902, and we talked about this in a previous video, Boveri and Sutton come up with the Chromosome Theory, based on seeing how chromosomes separate and pair during cell division, and saying, ""Hey, those seem to map up quite well ""to what Mendel described by these heritable factors."" Then we start having a lot more evidence for this. Morgan is able to show that a mutant eye color trait seems to be passed on in a way that shows that it is on the X sex chromosome, and he and his team start doing a lot more work, especially with fruit flies, to show that, ""Hey, chromosomes are the basis ""for where these heritable factors are."" But then even within the chromosomes, people weren't sure, chromosomes were made up of protein, made up of DNA, what was the molecule or the set of molecules that actually encoded for these heritable traits? And at first, most of the weight was on the protein side, because proteins were these complex molecules that had all of this variety that seemed that it could code for these heritable traits, while DNA, at least early on, seemed like a kind of boring molecule, people assumed that there wasn't a lot of diversity in DNA. They assumed that even if you go from one species to another that the DNA molecule was fundamentally the same. So early on, people actually were on the side more of the proteins. But then more and more evidence came on DNA's side, you had Griffith's experiment, where he was able to show, ""Hey, I could take ""this heat-killed bacteria, but if I mix it ""with some other living bacteria that somehow ""there's some transformation principle ""that transforms the living bacteria into the ""type of species that I had heat-killed."" And you go to 1944 and Avery, McCarty, and MacLeod are able to show some pretty good evidence that the actual principle, the thing that was left in that heat-killed bacteria, was probably DNA. And then we get even more conclusive evidence with the experiments of Hershey and Chase and we have a whole video on this. Where they say, ""Hey what is it that ""viruses inject into bacteria to hijack ""their genetic system?"" And they say, ""Hey, it's not proteins! ""It is DNA that does this."" So they provide much more conclusive evidence on the side of DNA. But even at that point, we as a community, as a civilization, still didn't know what the actual structure of DNA was. We also did not know, how did that structure actually code for all of these heritable factors? And the work culminates with Watson and Crick, but it was dependent on all of the people I mentioned, and more. And one person who should get special credit for, one, getting a little bit more evidence on the side of DNA and helping Watson and Crick, actually there's several people. But, in particular, Chargaff, and Rosalind Franklin, and Rosalind Franklin in particular probably does not get as much credit as she deserves. Chargaff's the one that showed, DNA actually is more interesting than people appreciated. He noticed that the frequencies of the nitrogenous bases of adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine in DNA varies across species. And, something that's somehow coding for what makes a species a species, well, it would have to vary across species so that makes DNA interesting. And then the other thing that he noticed, and this was key for Watson and Crick's work, is that the frequency of guanine is equal to the frequency of cytosine in DNA, and the frequency of adenine is equal to the frequency of thymine in DNA. And so it's a clue that these somehow are associated with each other, they somehow pair with each other. And so we get to the early '50's. We had all of this evidence that DNA is the molecular basis, you have Chargaff with his rules called Chargaff's Rules, and then you have Rosalind Franklin, and she's imaging diffraction patterns from X-rays beamed into crystals of DNA. So what I mean by crystal of DNA, a crystal is taking a bunch of molecules and arranging them in a regular pattern. So a crystal of DNA, that's one DNA molecule, then you have another DNA molecule, and then you have another DNA molecule, and then you beam X-rays at them, and X-rays are key because the wavelength of an X-ray is small enough to capture the features at an atomic level. So you beam X-rays and then the X-rays diffract. And then you capture the pattern of that diffraction. And then depending on the structures in the actual molecules you'll have different diffraction patterns. And Franklin's famous diffraction pattern is shown right over here, and when she immediately saw this, it had some of the telltale cues for a helical structure. Now, I wouldn't read too much into this if you're not an expert reader of X-ray diffraction patterns, this isn't a direct image of a DNA molecule, but they knew, she already knew and in fact people in this community already knew that this X pattern was a telltale sign for a helical structure of some kind, and then they were also able to look at the other clues here to think about, ""What's the spacing between different molecules?"" And even the spacing between the different turns of the helix structure. Now once again, this diffraction pattern is not a direct image. It's a very well-develped expertise to backwards map how things will diffract into the thing that actually caused the diffraction. And they would take it from multiple different angles to get a better understanding of it and actually today, you have computers doing this that could take a diffraction pattern and start to construct what the electron clouds of what the actual molecule looks like. So Franklin, this was painstaking work, and she already had a sense, she knew it was a helical structure but she was waiting to get a little bit more evidence before she published her work. Now at the same time, you have Watson and Crick here, who were trying to solve the structure. And they got a hold of Franklin's work with the help of Maurice Wilkins here, who Franklin worked with. And they were able to establish that it wasn't a single helix, but it was a double helix. And you actually had these base pairs forming the rungs of the double helix, and that was really interesting because that showed how DNA could replicate itself, how it could contain actual information. And we go into much much more depth in two future videos. Now the sad part about this story is, Wilkins, Watson, and Crick went on to win a Nobel prize, Franklin unfortunately died very young and you're not allowed to receive a Nobel prize if you've passed away. So she's very deserving of it. This work, which a lot of people consider to be one of the biggest discoveries in science, was based on what she did. Arguably, had Watson and Crick not had access to her work, they would not have been able to figure it out, and if she'd just stuck to what she was doing without other people having accessed her work, she might have been able to get to that same conclusion, so she is one of the people who, sometimes, the history of science overlooks. But this isn't to not give credit to Watson and Crick either, there were still a lot of very powerful intuitive leaps that they had to make to come up with this double helix structure, this anti-parallel double helix structure where they go in opposite directions, but they bridge with these nitrogenous bases pairing with each other. And this is a big, big, big, big deal. Throughout most of human history, we knew that traits were passed on but traits seemed like this magical mystical thing. ""I know my laugh is like my dad's, ""but how is that actually encoded in my DNA?"" And now, we're able to see that a lot of what we consider about ourselves to be us, is encoded in these molecules and encoded in these base pairs, so it's beautiful, it's incredible, it's shedding light on one of the biggest mysteries of what makes humans, actually all life, life.",science_biology_dna-as-the-genetic-material
" Let's remind ourselves a little bit of what we already know about orbitals and I've gone over this early on in the regular chemistry playlist. Let's say that this is the nucleus of our atom, super small, and around that we have our first orbital, the 1s orbital. The 1s orbital, you can kind of just view it as a cloud around the nucleus. So you have your 1s orbital and it can fit two electrons, so the first electron will go into the 1s orbital and then the second electron will also go into the 1s orbital. For example, hydrogen has only one electron, so it would go into 1s. Helium has one more, so that will also go into the 1s orbital. After that is filled, then you move onto the 2s orbital. The 2s orbital, you can view it as a shell around the 1s orbital, and all of these, you can't really view it in our conventional way of thinking. You can kind of view it as a probability cloud of where you might find the electrons. But for visualization purposes, just imagine it's kind of a shell cloud around the 1s orbital. So imagine that it's kind of a fuzzy shell around the 1s orbital, so it's around the 1s orbital, and your next electron will go there. Then the fourth electron will also go there, and I drew these arrows upward and downward because the first electron that goes into the 1s orbital has one spin and then the next electron to go into 1s orbital will have the opposite spin, and so they keep pairing up in that way. They have opposite spins. Now, if we keep adding electrons, now we move to the 2p orbitals. Actually, you can view it as there are three 2p orbitals and each of them can hold two electrons, so it can hold a total of six electrons in the 2p orbitals. Let me draw them for you just so you can visualize it. So if we were to label our axis here, so think in three dimensions. So imagine that that right there is the x-axis. Let me do this in different colors. Let's say that this right here is our y-axis and then we have a z-axis. I'll do that in blue. Let's say we have a z-axis just like that. You actually have a p orbital that goes along each of those axes. So you could have your two-- let me do it in the same color. So you have your 2p sub x orbital, and so what that'll look like is a dumbbell shape that's going in the x-direction. So let me try my best attempt at drawing this. It's a dumbbell shape that goes in the x-direction, in kind of both directions, and it's actually symmetric. I'm drawing this end bigger than that end so it looks like it's coming out at you a little bit, but let me draw it a little bit better than that. I can do a better job. And maybe it comes out like that. Remember, these are really just probability clouds, but it's helpful to kind of visualize them as maybe a little bit more things that we would see in our world, but I think probability cloud is the best way to think about it. So that is the 2px orbital, and then I haven't talked about how they get filled yet, but then you also have your 2py orbital, which'll go in this axis, but same idea, kind of a dumbbell shape in the y-direction, going in both along the y-axis, going in that direction and in that direction. Then, of course, so let me do this 2py, and then you also have your 2pz, and that goes in the z-direction up like that and then downwards like that. So when you keep adding electrons, the first-- so far, we've added four electrons. If you add a fifth electron, you would expect it to go into the 2px orbital right there. So even though this 2px orbital can fit two electrons, the first one goes there. The very next one won't go into that one. It actually wants to separate itself within the p orbital, so the very next electron that you add won't go into 2px, it'll go into 2py. And then the one after that won't go into 2py or 2px, it'll go into 2pz. They try to separate themselves. Then if you add another electron, if you add-- let's see, we've added one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. If you add an eighth electron, that will then go into the 2px orbital, so the eighth electron would go there, but it would have the opposite spin. So this is just a little bit of review with a little bit of visualization. Now, given what we just reviewed, let's think about what's happening with carbon. Carbon has six electrons. Its electron configuration, it is 1s2, two electrons in the 1s orbital. Then 2s2, then 2p2, right? It only has two left, because it has a total of six electrons. Two go here, then there, then two are left to fill the p orbitals. If you go based on what we just drew and what we just talked about here, what you would expect for carbon-- let me just draw it out the way I did this. So you have your 1s orbital, your 2s orbital, and then you have your 2px orbital, your 2py orbital, and then you have your 2pz orbital. If you just go straight from the electron configuration, you would expect carbon, so the 1s orbital fills first, so that's our first electron, our second electron, our third electron. Then we go to our 2s orbital, That fills next, third electron, then fourth electron. Then you would expect maybe your fifth electron to go in the 2px. We could have said 2py or 2z. It just depends on how you label the axis. But you would have your fifth electron go into one of the p orbitals, and then you would expect your sixth to go into another. So you would expect that to be kind of the configuration for carbon. And if we were to draw it-- let me draw our axes. That is our y-axis and then this is our x-axis. Let me draw it a little bit better than that. So that is the x-axis and, of course, you have your z-axis. You have to think in three dimensions a little bit. Then you have your z-axis, just like that. So first we fill the 1s orbital, so if our nucleus is sitting here, our 1s orbital gets filled with two electrons. You can imagine that as a little cloud around the nucleus. Then we fill the 2s orbital and that would be a cloud around that, kind of a shell around that. Then we would put one electron in the 2px orbital, so one electron would start kind of jumping around or moving around, depending how you want to think about it, in that orbital over there, 2px. Then you'd have the next electron jumping around or moving around in the 2py orbital, so it would be moving around like this. If you went just off of this, you would say, you know what? These guys, this guy over here and that guy over there is lonely. He's looking for a opposite spin partner. This would be the only places that bonds would form. You would expect some type of bonding to form with the x-orbitals or the y-orbitals. Now, that's what you would expect if you just straight-up kind of stayed with this model of how things fill and how orbitals look. The reality of carbon, and I guess the simplest reality of carbon, is if you look at a methane molecule, is very different than what you would expect here. First of all, what you would expect here is that carbon would probably-- maybe it would form two bonds. But we know carbon forms four bonds and it wants to pretend like it has eight electrons. Frankly, almost every atom wants to pretend like it has eight electrons. So in order for that to happen, you have to think about a different reality. This isn't really what's happening when carbon bonds, so not what happens when carbon bonds. What's really happening when carbon bonds, and this will kind of go into the discussion of sp3 hybridization, but what you're going to see is it's not that complicated of a topic. It sounds very daunting, but it's actually pretty straightforward. What really happens when carbon bonds, because it wants to form four bonds with things, is its configuration, you could imagine, looks more like this. So you have 1s. We have two electrons there. Then you have your 2s, 2px, 2py and 2pz. Now what you can imagine is it wants to form four bonds. It has four electrons that are willing to pair up with electrons from other molecules. In the case of methane, that other molecule is a hydrogen. So what you could imagine is that the electrons actually-- maybe the hydrogen brings this electron right here into a higher energy state and puts it into 2z. That's one way to visualize it. So this other guy here maybe ends up over there, and then these two guys are over there and over there. Now, all of a sudden, it looks like you have four lonely guys and they are ready to bond, and that's actually more accurate of how carbon bonds. It likes to bond with four other people. Now, it's a little bit arbitrary which electron ends up in each of these things, and even if you had this type of bonding, you would expect things to bond along the x, y, and z axis. The reality is, the reality of carbon, is that these four 1electrons in its second shell don't look like they're in 1just-- the first one doesn't look like it's just in the s 1orbital and then the p and y and z for the other three. 1They all look like they're a little bit in the s and a 1little bit in the p orbitals. 1Let me make that clear. 1So instead of this being a 2s, what it really looks like for 1carbon is that this looks like a 2sp3 orbital. 1This looks like a 2sp3 orbital, that looks like a 12sp3 orbital, that looks like a 2sp3 orbital. 1They all look like they're kind of in the same orbital. 1This special type of-- it sounds very fancy. 1This sp3 hybridized orbital, what it actually looks like is 1something that's in between an s and a p orbital. 1It has a 25% s nature and a 75% p nature. 1You can imagine it as being a mixture of these four things. 1That's the behavior that carbon has. 1So when you mix them all, instead of having an s 1orbital, so if this is a nucleus and we do a 1cross-section, an s orbital looks like that and the p 1orbital looks something like that in cross-section. 1So this is a an s and that is a p. 1When they get mixed up, the orbital looks like this. 1An sp3 orbital looks something like this. 1This is a hybridized sp3 orbital. 1Hybrid just means a combination of two things. 1A hybrid car is a combination of gas and electric. 1A hybridized orbital is a combination of s and p. 1Hybridized sp3 orbitals are the orbitals when carbon bonds 1with things like hydrogen or really when 1it bonds with anything. 1So if you looked at a molecule of methane, and people talk 1about sp3 hybridized orbitals, all they're saying is that you 1have a carbon in the center. 1Let's say that's the carbon nucleus right there. 1And instead of having one s and three p orbitals, it has 1four sp3 orbitals. 1So let me try my best at drawing the four sp3 orbitals. 1Let's say this is the big lobe that is kind of pointing near 1us, and then it has a small lobe in the back. 1Then you have another one that has a big lobe like that and a 1small lobe in the back. 1Then you have one that's going back behind the page, so let 1me draw that. 1You can kind of imagine a three-legged stool, and then 1its small lobe will come out like that. 1And then you have one where the big lobe is pointing 1straight up, and it has a small lobe going down. 1You can imagine it as kind of a three-legged stool. 1One of them is behind like that and it's pointing 1straight up, So a three-legged stool with something-- it's 1kind of like a tripod, I guess is the best way 1to think about it. 1So that's the carbon nucleus in the center and then you 1have the hydrogens, so that's our carbon right there. 1Then you have your hydrogens. 1You have a hydrogen here. 1A hydrogen just has one electron in the 1s orbital, so 1the hydrogen has a 1s orbital. 1You have a hydrogen here that just has a 1s orbital. 1It has a hydrogen here, 1s orbital, 1hydrogen here, 1s orbital. 1So this is how the hydrogen orbital and the carbon 1orbitals get mixed. 1The hydrogens 1s orbital bonds with-- well, each of the 1hydrogen's 1s orbital bonds with each of the 1carbon's sp3 orbitals. 1Just so you get a little bit more notation, so when people 1talk about hybridized sp3 orbitals, all they're saying 1is, look, carbon doesn't bond. 1Once carbon-- this right here is a 1molecule of methane, right? 1This is CH4, or methane, and it doesn't bond like you would 1expect if you just want with straight 1vanilla s and p orbitals. 1If you just went with straight vanilla s and p orbitals, the 1bonds would form. 1Maybe the hydrogen might be there and there, and if it had 1four hydrogens, maybe there and there, depending on how 1you want to think about it. 1But the reality is it doesn't look like that. 1It looks more like a tripod. 1It has a tetrahedral shape. 1The best way that that can be explained, I guess the shape 1of the structure, is if you have four equally-- four of 1the same types of orbital shapes, and those four types 1of orbital shapes are hybrids between s's and p's. 1One other piece of notation to know, sometimes people think 1it's a very fancy term, but when you have a bond between 1two molecules, where the orbitals are kind of pointing 1at each other, so you can imagine right here, this 1hydrogen orbital is pointing in that direction. 1This sp3 orbital is pointing that direction, and they're 1overlapping right around here. 1This is called a sigma bond, where the overlap is along the 1same axis as if you connected the two molecules. 1Over here, you connect the two molecules, the overlap is on 1that same axis. 1This is the strongest form of covalent bonds, and this'll be 1a good basis for discussion maybe in the next video when 1we talk a little bit about pi bonds. 1The big takeaway of this video is to just understand what 1does it mean? 1What is an sp3 hybridized orbital? 1Nothing fancy, just a 1combination of s and p orbitals. 1It has 25% s character, 75% p character, which makes sense. 1It's what exists when carbon forms bonds, especially in the 1case of methane. 1That's what describes it's tetrahedral structure. 1That's why we have an angle between the various branches 1of a 109.5 degrees, which some teachers might want you know, 1so it's useful to know. 1If you take this angle right here, 109.5, that's the same 1thing as that angle, or if you were to go behind it, that 1angle right there, 109.5 degrees, explained by sp3 1hybridization. 1The bonds themselves are sigma bonds. 1The overlap is along the axis connecting the hydrogen.",science_organic-chemistry_gen-chem-review
" -  So we're given four different equations here and each of them have a blank, and we need to fill in that blank with a missing number. So let's do each of these. So on the left hand side of this equation, we have one plus four, so one plus four is the same thing as... Well, one plus four is five. If we take four, and if you add one more, you're gonna have five. So now, we finished that one, because one plus four is the same thing as five. Now here, we're saying four plus something is the same thing as five. Well, we just figured out that one plus four, or four plus one is the same thing as five. So four plus one is five. So notice there, we have the equation, four plus one is the same thing as five. Equals means that what's on the left is the same thing as what you have on the right. Now we have blank plus two is equal to five. So what plus two is the same thing as five? Well, three plus two is equal to five, or five is equal to three plus two. Now you go here. Well now you have three plus blank is equal to five. Well, we already figured it out, because three plus two is equal to five. So we can write three plus two is equal to five, and then we can check ourselves. And then we can keep going. So now we have some subtraction. So what's the same thing as nine minus three? So if I have nine things, and if I were to take away three of them, I'm going to have six left. Nine minus three is the same thing as six. 10 minus blank is equal to six. So what do I have to take away from 10 in order to have six left over? Well, if I take four away from 10, I'm going to have six left over. Now something minus one is the same thing as six. Well, seven minus one is going to be equal to six. And then we get eight minus blank is equal to six. So how many do I have to take away from eight in order to get to six? Well, if I take away one, I'm going to get seven. If I take away two, I'm going to have six. So eight minus two is equal to six.",math_early-math_cc-early-math-add-sub-basics
" -  So we're given this expression is the Taylor series about zero for which of the following functions and they give us some choices here. So let's just think a little bit about this series that they gave us. So if we were to expand it out, let's see, when n is equal to zero, it'd be negative one to the zero power which is one times x to the zero which is one over zero factorial which is one so it'll be one plus and then when n is one, well then this is going to be negative so it's going to be minus and then x to the first over one factorial over, well, I could just write that as x over here and then when n is two, the negative one squared, that's gonna be positive x squared over two and there's going to be minus x to the third over three factorial and then it's going to be plus and I can keep going. You've seen this before. x to the fourth over four factorial and it's gonna keep going. Minus, plus. It's going to keep alternating on and on and on. Now, our general form for a Taylor series about zero which we could also call a Maclaurin series would be, our general form would be f of zero plus f prime of zero times x plus f prime prime of zero times x squared over two plus the the third derivative at zero times x to the third over three factorial plus the fourth derivative, you get the idea, evaluated at zero times x to the fourth over four factorial and we would just go on and on and on. Now, to figure out which function, in order what I wrote in blue to be the Maclaurin or to be the Taylor series about zero or in order to be the Maclaurin series, that means that, that means that f of zero needs to be equal to one. It means that f prime of zero, actually let me write this down. It means that f of zero needs to be equal to one. f of zero is equal to one. It means that f prime of zero needs to be the coefficient on the x here which is negative one and we could keep going. It means that, it means that the second derivative at zero, well, that's going to be the coefficient on this x squared over two so that's gotta be equal to one and you see the general idea that the third derivative at zero is equal to negative one. It's the coefficient on the x to the third over three factorial which is negative one right over here. And so just using this information can we figure out which of these it is. So you could do a little bit of deductive reasoning here. Let's evaluate all of these functions at zero and see which of these are one. So sine of zero. Well, that's zero. Just by looking at this first constraint, sine of zero isn't one. We can rule that out. Cosine of zero is one so that's still in the running. e to the zero is one. e to the zero is one and then the natural log of one plus zero, that's the natural log of one which is a zero so that's out of the running. So just from that first constraint knowing that f of zero is equal to one, we're able to rule out two of the choices then knowing that the first derivative evaluated at zero is going to be negative one but what's the first derivative of cosine of x? Well, it's the negative sine of x. If we evaluate that at zero, we're not gonna get negative one. We're gonna get zero so we can rule this out. Now, the first derivative of e to the x is e to the x. If we evaluate that at zero, we're gonna get one, not negative one so we can rule that out. And so not even looking at anything else, we have a pretty good sense that D is probably our answer but we could check. The first derivative here, f prime of x here is going to be negative e to the negative x. So f prime of zero is going to be, is going to be negative e to the zero or negative one so it meets that one and if you were curious, you could keep going and see that it meets all the other constraints but choice D is the only one that meets even the first two constraints for the function at zero and the first derivative at zero.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-series
"  In the last video, we learned that 380,000 years after the Big Bang, which is still roughly 13.7 billion years ago, every point-- I shouldn't say every point-- every atom in space that was kind of at this roughly 3,000 Kelvin temperature was emitting this electromagnetic radiation. Since every point in space was, there were points in space, or there was points in the universe, that that radiation is only just now reaching us. It has been traveling for 13.7 billion years. So when we look at radiation that's been traveling for that long, we can look at any direction and we'll see this uniform radiation. And that radiation has been red-shifted into the microwave range from the higher frequencies that it was actually emitted at. Now, a question that might pop in your brain is, well, what happens if we wait a billion years? Because if we wait a billion years, if we have 1,000,380,000 years after the beginning of the universe, this stuff won't just be atoms anymore. It will have started to condense into actual stars. The universe at every point in space will no longer be this uniform. We'll actually start having condensation into stars. So if we move forward a little bit, the universe will expand. Maybe I'll just draw a half of it since it's expanded. It's obviously expanded much more. But now all of a sudden, we actually have stars. These are no longer just uniform atoms spread through the universe. We actually have condensation into stars. And so if you look at what is being emitted from the points in space from which we're only now getting this cosmic background radiation, if we wait a billion years, the light that we see from those points in space will not look like this uniform radiation. It'll start to look a little bit more like the more mature parts of the universe. We'll essentially be looking at the universe a billion years after the Big Bang, when stars have formed, other structures have formed. So the question is in a billion years, will this cosmic microwave background radiation disappear. And I'm using billion just to arbitrarily use a number. But will it eventually disappear? And the answer to that is yes and no. So to think about it, it is true that this point in space will mature. It will mature in a billion years. It will no longer be this uniform-- I guess this uniform haze of hot hydrogen atoms. But what you have to think about is there were further points in the universe.  At that same time, there were further points that were also emitting this radiation. And the original photons from those original points still haven't gotten to us. So from those further out points-- right now, the observable universe is-- we can only see electromagnetic radiation that's been traveling for 13.7 billion years. In another billion years, the universe will be a billion years older. And then there will be radiation that has been traveling for 14.7 billion years. And so we will start to observe that. And we'll start to observe that radiation from the same time period in the universe. It'll just be from further out. Now, what I want to make clear is, is that since those points were even further out, where that radiation was emitted, the stuff that we'll see in a billion years, it will be even more red-shifted.  So at that point, the cosmic background radiation we see will have longer wavelengths than the radio spectrum. It will be redder And I should say redder because we're already more-- would ""redder"" have two Ds? I've never written ""redder."" Well, it would be more red than the microwave radiation. And, of course, that's a funny thing because microwave radiation is already more red than actual visible red light. It has a longer wavelength. Now, this will keep happening. And it'll keep happening. We'll keep getting radiation as we go further and further into the future. We'll keep getting radiation from further out points in space. And it'll get more and more red-shifted. The actual wave lengths of that electromagnetic light will be bigger, and bigger, and bigger. Until we really aren't able to even see it as electromagnetic light because it'll be red-shifted to infinity. It'll have an infinite wavelength. And to make that point clear, I want to show you that at some point, there will be kind of a threshold where we can't even get radiation from further out. And let me draw a diagram of that. So let's say that this is the universe. Let's say that this is the universe 13.7 billion years ago, right when that radiation, what we now see as cosmic microwave background radiation, right when it started to be admitted. And let's say that this is the point in the universe where we are now. So this is us. Let's say that this is the point in the universe where we now observe the background radiation-- or this is one of the points. We obviously could form a circle around us. It could be any of these points over here, where the photons, the electromagnetic radiation that were emitted from this point, 380,000 years after the beginning of the universe, is only just now reaching us. So this is the point in the universe from which we are observing the cosmic background radiation. And let me be very clear. That point in the universe has now matured into things that look-- into stars and galaxies and planets. And if they were to look at our point in space, they are also going to see cosmic background radiation from us. It's not like some type of permanently old place. It's just the light we're getting from them right now is old light, light that that point in space emitted way before it was able to mature into actual structures. So this is the point in space from which we are receiving cosmic background radiation right now. I don't want to write all that. It'll take me forever. Now, let's take another point in space that's whatever this distance is. Well, it's actually estimated to be about-- now, it's estimated to be about 46 billion light years. At that time, when things were just beginning to be emitted, this was only about 36 million light years. And this is a very rough estimate. I shouldn't even write it down. Because that's really based on how fast we assume the universe is expanding and all of that type of thing. But it was just a lot smaller than 46 billion light years. Now let's go that same distance again from this point in space. So let me make it clear. This is 380,000 years ago. Now let's fast forward. Let's fast forward-- sorry, not 380,000 years ago, 380,000 years after the Big Bang, which is approximately-- it's still 13.7 billion years ago. So that's then. Now let's look at now. And now I'll just draw it a little bit bigger. It's actually going to be much, much bigger now. Now, if we do it a little bit bigger-- so when I draw it like this, this is where we are now. This point in space from which we are only now receiving that cosmic background radiation is over here. And then this other point in space is going to be over here. And we saw in the video on the actual size of the observable universe, not just what it appears to be based on how long the light's been travelling, this is now on the order of 46 or 47 billion light years.  And so this distance is also going to be 46 billion light years.  Now, every point in space, back then, was emitting this radiation. We have this uniform radiation. It was just hydrogen atoms everywhere, these hot hydrogen atoms. Maybe I should just do it in the color of the radiation. So this guy's receiving-- I'm just showing it's coming from this guy. We're only now, 13.7 billion years in the future, receiving photons from this guy, only now are we receiving it. And frankly, this green guy, only now is going to be receiving photons. When he looks at the point in space, or the things that he thinks are points in space out there, he will see that uniform radiation. And likewise, this guy over here will only now be receiving photons from the point in space for where we are now. He'll see the universe where we are now as it was 380,000 years after the Big Bang. And same thing from that point in space, the photons will only just now reach. Now, let's think about it. It took this guy's photons-- let me make it clear. It took him 13.7 billion years to reach this point over here, which is now 46 billion light years away from us. And the universe continues to expand. Depending on if the universe expands fast enough, there's no way that that photon that got to this guy, will eventually get to this. The universe is expanding faster than the light can never even catch up to us. And this light will never, ever, ever get to us. And so there is some threshold, some distance, from which we will never get light during this time period or actually from which we will never, ever get any electromagnetic radiation. So the simple answer is the cosmic background radiation from this-- or the cosmic background radiation from this point, yes, it will start to mature. It won't be as uniform if we go fast forward 400 million years or a billion years. But we will get uniform radiation from further out. But it will be even more red-shifted. And the further forward we get into the future, the background radiation we get will be from further and further out and it will be more and more and more red-shifted. 1Until some point, where it's going 1to be so red-shifted that we won't even observe it 1as electromagnetic radiation. 1And there's some threshold where we won't even observe anything 1anymore because beyond that, the light wasn't 1able to actually get to us.",science_cosmology-and-astronomy_universe-scale-topic
" -  What we're gonna do in this video is see how we can approximate limits graphically and using tables. In the future, we're also going to be able to learn techniques where we're going to be able to directly figure out exactly what this limit is. But for now, let's think about how to approximate it, and I'll build our intuition for even what a limit actually is. So we want to know the limit as x approaches two of x to the third minus 2x squared over 3x minus six. Now, the first thing you might wanna check out is, well, what is this expression equal to when x is exactly equal to two? And we could do that by substituting x with two, so it'll be two to the third power minus two times two squared over three times two minus six. Well, this numerator over here, this is eight minus two times four minus eight, so that's going to be equal to zero, and then the denominator over here is six minus six. Well, that's a zero, and we end up in the indeterminate form right over here. So this expression is not defined for x equals two, but we can think about what does the expression approach as x approaches two. And first, let's think about it visually. So, if we were to graph it, and I graph this on the site Desmos, which has a nice graphing calculator, you see the curve, y equals this expression right over here. So this is the curve of y is equal... Let me do that in a darker color. This is equal to y is equal to x to the third minus 2x squared over 3x minus six. And you can see, at least everywhere where I've shown it here, and it's actually true, it's defined everywhere except for when x is equal to two, and that's why we have this little gap over here, showing that it is not defined. And so what I wanna do is I wanna approximate, well, as x gets closer and closer to two, either from lower values of two or from larger values of two, what is the value of this expression or the value of this function approaching? And at this level of zoom, it looks like it's approaching this value right over here, so as x gets closer and closer to two, it looks like our function is getting closer and closer to that value there, regardless of which direction we are approaching from, and so just approximating it visually right over here, let's see. This is zero, this is two. This is one, right over here. This would be 1.5. At this level of zoom, it looks like it's about 1.3 or 1.4, so 1.3 or 1.4. Let's zoom in a little bit more, and if you have access to a graphing calculator or you go to a website like Desmos or Wolfram Alpha, you can zoom in further and further on this graph, so I encourage you to try that out yourself or do it with other graphs. So let's zoom in even more. So once again, we're not defined at x equals two, but here we get a slightly better read. Let's see, this is one, this is two. The value that we are approaching as x gets closer and closer to two, we're getting, our value is getting closer and closer to that right over there, and if we look at what y value that is, let's see, if this is... This is split into one, two, three, four, five. So this is 1.2 right over here. This is 1.4 right over here. So it looks like it's between... So this would be 1.3 right over there. So it's a little bit more than 1.3. So a little more than 1.3. So, approximately, 1.3... Now, I do that in a lighter color. So it's approximately 1.3 something, it looks like. Let's zoom in even more to see if we can get an even better approximation. So now, once again, we're approaching that same value. We're not defined at x equals two, but as we're approaching x equals two, let's see. Let me get a darker color. So, it would be right around there, and this is, let's see, this is one, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5. So once again, it looks like it's about one point... If I were to just base it off of this, it looks like it's about 1.333 or 1.34, so I'd say approximately 1.33. So, approximately 1.33. If I were, it looks like it might be approaching 1 1/3, but we don't know for sure. Remember, when you're trying to figure out a limit from a graph the best you can really do here is just approximate, try to eyeball, well, the closer x gets to two, it looks like this function is approaching this value right over here. Now, another technique which tends to be a little bit more precise is to try to approximate this limit numerically. So let's do that. So let me get rid of these graphs here. We already got a sense of what the graphs can do for us. They got us to about 1.33, but now, let's try to do it numerically. So, I'm going to set up a table here, and I encourage you to do the same. So, on this column, I'll have my x, and on this column, I'm going to say, well, what is the expression x minus 2x squared over 3x minute six equals? And we know that when x is exactly equal to two, that this thing right over here isn't defined, but let's see what happens as we approach two. So let's see what happens when we're at 1.9, or 1.99... I'll do 1.99... I'll do 1.999. And we could also see from the other direction. We could say, well, what happens when we approach at 2.001, and see if we are getting... If this, if both of these values seem to be approaching something, and so this is approaching it from lower values of x and then we could say this was approaching it from higher values of x. We could say 2.1, right over here. So let me get a calculator out and evaluate these, and I encourage you to do the same, get a calculator out, and see if you can evaluate these things. All right, so let's see. If we can evaluate it when x equals 1.9, it's going to be 1.9 to the third power minus two times... Two times 1.9 squared. 1.9 squared is equal to, so we get that value, and then we're going to divide by, divide by, we get, we're gonna divide by three times 1.9 minus six, and that's going to be equal to, looks like it's about 1.203, so I'll just write approximately 1.203. Now, let's try it with a much closer value of x. So that was just 1.9. Now let's go to 1.999. So once again, we're gonna have 1.999 to the third power, and then minus two times, open parentheses, 1.999 squared, close the parentheses, is equal to, so that's my numerator, and then my denominator, so divided by, divided by, and now, open parentheses, three times 1.999 minus six, close my parentheses, is equal to 1.332. So this is interesting. So approximately 1.332. So numerically, I seem to be approaching that same value or close to that same value that I was approaching graphically, and we can also do it from values of x greater than two. Let me get my calculator back, and I'll do some of it, and I encourage you to finish this up on your own, and you could even try 1.999999 to see what it actually is approaching. So, for example, if I wanted to try 2.1, so that would be 2.1 to the third power, minus two times, open parentheses, 2.1 squared, and then close parentheses is equal to, that's my numerator, divided by, open parentheses, three times 2.1 minus 6, close parentheses. That's my denominator, and I get 1.47, so approximately 1.47. So now you can think I'm getting closer and closer to two from values larger than two. Let's see if we seem to be approaching the same value. So now let's get even closer to two, 2.01. And I'll do this one, and then I'll leave it up to you to see if you can get even more precise. So, two point... Actually, let's get super precise. Let's, well, let's do three zeroes here. 2.0001 to the third power minus two times, open parentheses, 2.0001. So we're getting really close. 1Squared, close parentheses, 1is equal to, so that's my numerator, 1divided by, open parentheses, 1three times 2.0001, 1minus six, this is my denominator. 1Is equal to, and notice, we're getting closer and closer 1and closer to 1 1/3, 1.333... 1Now, five. 1So, we'll say approximately 1.333, 1and this is now for, 1this is actually for 2.0001. 1So it does indeed look like we are approaching 1.333333, 1or close to, it looks like we are approaching 1 1/3. 1But once again, these are just approximations, 1both through the table or graphically. 1If you wanna find the exact value of the limit, 1there are other techniques. 1We're going to explore those techniques in future videos.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-limits-continuity
" -(Voice over) So we left off in part one getting pretty close to finding our N of T that satisfies the logistic differential equation where it's initial condition is between zero and K, and now we just have to really just do some algebra to finish things up. So we left with this. For our N of T this must be true. Now, we could use a little bit of logarithm properties to rewrite this left hand side as the logarithm of. The logarithm of something minus the logarithm of something else, that's going to be the first something, The logarithm of the first something divided by the second something. One minus N over K, and this is of course going to be equal to all this business that we have, is going to be equal to, actually let me just write it. It's going to be equal to, equal to, R times T plus C, plus C, and now what we could do, this is the same thing as saying that E to the R T plus C is going to be equal to this thing right over here. This, the natural log of this, is equal to the exponent that I have to raise E to to get to this right over here, so I could just write that. We could just write, or another way of thinking about it, we could take E, if this is equal to that, we could take E to this power on this left hand side, and E to this power on this right hand side, and they should be equal. So E to this power is just going to be what's inside the parenthesis. It's just going to be N. It's just going to be N over one minus, one minus, N over K. I'll do that in a green color, so you can keep track of where things came from. Is equal to E to this business. Is equal to E to the R T. R, I'll do the T in white. R T plus C, plus C. Now this I could rewrite if I want to. If I have E to something plus something else, I could rewrite this as to the R T times E times E to the C, and just to simplify things, this is just going to be another constant here, and I could, if this is C, I could call it C one, but I'm just going to call that a constant. So I could just say that that's going to be equal to some constant times E to the R T, and now we just need to solve for N. And once again, at any point while we're working on this you get inspired, feel free to solve for N. So let's see. One way to solve for N. Let's see. If we could take the reciprocal of both sides of this, we're going to get. Let me draw a line here just so you know we're. Let me draw a line. So, if we take the reciprocal of both sides of this, we're going to get one over N, one minus N over K over light green N is equal to, is equal to, and so let's, we could say it's equal to, it's equal to one over C time E to the negative R T. But one over C, that's just going to be another constant. So I could write one over C here, and I take the reciprocal. And once again, this is just going to be another constant, so I'm going to be a little bit of hand waving, and say well O.K we're going to get another constant here. I could have called this C one, this C two. I could call this C three if I want to make it clear that these are not going to be the same number. This is E to the this power. This is the reciprocal of that. Actually, maybe I'll do that just to make it a little bit clearer. That would have been C one right over there, and so this is going to be, sorry, the reciprocal of this C three and E to the negative, the reciprocal of E to the R T is E to the negative R T. E to the negative, E to the negative R, E to the negative R T. And let's see, if we divide the numerator and the denominator by N, or if we divide E. I want to think, if we divide this term by in we're going to get. So this term by N is going to be one over N, and then this term by N is just going to be minus one over K. So this is just going to be minus one over K is equal to this. This is equal to this business. So copy and paste. It's going to be equal to that. This is good algebra practice here. Now let's see. We could take this one over K, add it to both sides, so let's do that. So let me just cut, so let me cut and paste it. I'm going to add it to both sides, so that should be a plus one over K. So, plus one over K. And now to solve for N, I just take the reciprocal of both sides. So I'm going to get, I'm going to get N. And I'll write it in kind of the function notation. N of T, actually let me make my T in white since I've been taking the trouble all this time of rewriting this in white, is equal to one over. Is going to be equal to one over all of this business. Is going to be equal to one over all of this business. So copy and paste. Is going to be equal to that. And that by itself. That's by itself is already interesting. That by itself is already interesting. So I could write it like this. And if I want, if I don't like, let's see, well yeah I could just, if I don't like having this K kind of a fraction in a fraction, I could rewrite it as. Actually, maybe I'll do it over here. N of, N of T is equal to. I'll just multiply the numerator and the denominator by. I'll just multiply it, actually let me just leave it like that for now. And what I'm going do, what I'm now going to do, is say, ""Well look. ""We're assuming that N of zero is N sub knot."" So we're assuming that N of zero, N of zero, is equal to N sub knot. So let's write this thing. Let's solve for the constant. Let's figure out what this could be if we know what our initial condition is. So N of zero, N of zero, is going to be equal to, is going to be equal to one, one over. When T is zero, this is just going to be equal to one, so it's just going to be our constant C three plus one over K plus one over the maximum population that our population, that our environment, can handle, and that's going to be equal to N knot, and now we can solve for our constant. So we get, let's see I'm probably going to need a lot of real estate for this, so I can take the reciprocal of both sides again, so this is something that we're doing a lot of. C three plus one over K is equal to one over N knot. Is equal to one over N knot. Just took the reciprocal of both sides, and so we get our constant C three is equal to one over N knot minus one over K. Minus one over K. So we can rewrite our solution, which we'll call the logistic function, we get, we get, this is fun now, N of T. N of T is equal to one over, our constant is this, so it's going to be, let me copy and paste this. So copy and paste. It's going to be that, that's our constant. So it's going to be that times E to the negative R T, to the negative R times T, plus one over K, plus one over K. And if we don't like having all of these denominators in, all of these fractions in the denominator, why don't we multiply everything times the numerator and the denominator by N knot K. So I'm going to multiply the numerator times N knot K, and I'm going to multiply the denominator by N knot K. N knot K. And so what do we get? This is all going to be equal to. In the numerator I have N knot times K, N knot times K. And in the denominator I am going to have, let's see if I multiply this term right over here times N knot K I'm going to have K. If I multiply this term times N knot K, I'm going to have N knot, so it's going to be minus N knot, minus N not, times E to the negative R T, Times E to the negative R T, negative R T, and then if I multiply this times N not K, I'm going to get N knot. So plus N knot. And there you have it. We have found a solution for the logistic differential equation. We will call this logistic function, and in future videos we will explore it more, and we will see what it actually does. If you were to plot this, and I encourage you to do so, either on the internet, you could try Wolfram Alpha, or if you're on your graphing calculator, you will see that it has the exact properties that we want it to have. It starts at N knot. It starts to increase at an increasing rate, but then it starts to slow down as we reach our maximum population. And so that is actually a very neat function. If you model a population with this, you can kind of start to make predictions about what might the population be at time whatever. And so, hopefully, you found that satisfying.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-diff-equations
" We've got 9,601 minus 8,023. And immediately when we try to start subtracting in our ones place, we have a problem. This 3 is larger than this 1. And we also have that problem in the tens place. This 2 is larger than this 0. So we're going to have to do some type of borrowing or regrouping. And so the way I like to think about it-- I like to go to the first place value that has something to give. Obviously, the tens place is in no position to give anything to the ones place. It needs things itself. And so we're going to go to the hundreds place. And the hundreds place has an abundance of value that it can regroup into the tens and ones place. This 6 right over here represents 600. So why don't we take 100 from that 600-- so then this will become 500-- and then give that 100 over to the tens place. Now, if we give 100 to the tens place, how would I represent that in the tens place? Well, I have zero 10's. And now I'm going to give 100. 100 is the same thing as 10 10's. It's going to be 0 plus 100. 100 in the tens place is just 10. So let me write it this way. So this right over here is now going to be rewritten as 10. Now, you might be saying, wait, wait, wait. What's going on here, Sal? You took 100 from the hundreds place. That's why it became 500. Now, why did this become 10 and not 100? Now remember, this is 10 10's. So this is still representing 100. You have not changed the value of this top number. Before, the value was 9,000 plus 600 plus 1. Now it's 9,000 plus 500 plus 100-- 10 10's is 100-- plus 1. I have not changed the value here. Now, we're still not done yet. We don't want to just subtract because we still have the problem with the ones place. The ones place still doesn't have enough value. Now, the good thing is we've given some value to the tens place. So why don't we take 10 from the tens place? So if you have 10 10's, and you take one 10 away, you're going to be left with nine 10's, or 90. And then we can take that 10 and give it to the ones place So let's do that. You take that 10 we just took from there, and you give it to the ones place. You now have 11 here. And now we are ready to subtract. 11 minus 3 is 8. 9 minus 2-- and this is really 90 minus 20-- is 70. But in the tens place, we represent that as a 7. 500 minus zero hundred is 500, represented as a 5 in the hundreds place. 9,000 minus 8,000 is 1,000. And we're done. And just to make things really clear, I'm going to redo this problem now but with things expanded out. So this first number is 9,000 plus 600 plus zero 10's plus 1. And this number right here, we're subtracting 8,000. We're subtracting zero 100's. We're subtracting two 10's, which is 20. Subtracting 20. And subtracting three 1's. So I have just rewritten this exact same statement. But the regrouping and the borrowing is going to become a little bit clearer now. So the same exact thing-- we said, hey, we can't subtract the 3 from the 1 or the 20 from the 0. But we have a lot of value right over here in the 600. So why don't we take 100 from that? So this becomes 500. And we give that 100 to the tens place. So this becomes 100. Notice, the value has not changed. This is 9,000 plus 500 plus 100 plus 1. That's the same thing as 9,000 plus 600 plus 1. We've just put the value in different places. And here we have explicitly written 100. But when we represent it in the tens place, 10 10's is the same thing as 100. Now, we aren't done regrouping just yet. We want to give some value to the ones place. So we can take 10 from the tens place-- and this becomes a 90-- and give that 10 to the ones place. 10 plus 1 is 11. So notice, I did the exact borrowing, the exact regrouping, that I did here. I just represented it a little bit different. This 500 was represented by a 5 in the hundreds place. This 90 was represented by a 9 in the tens place. But either way, we're ready to subtract now. 11 minus 3 is 8. 90 minus 20 is 70. Write a plus there. 500 minus 0 is 500. And then 9,000 minus 8,000 is 1,000. And we got the same result because 1,000 plus 500 plus 70 plus 8 is 1,578.",math_arithmetic-home_addition-subtraction
" -  In the last couple videos I talked about the local linearization of a function. And in terms of graphs, there's a nice interpretation here where if you imagine a graph of a function and you want to approximate it near a specific point, you picture that point somewhere on the graph, and it doesn't have to be there, you know I can choose to be anywhere else along the graph, but if you have some sort of point and you want to approximate the function near there you can have another function whose graph is just a flat plane, and specifically a plane which is tangent to your original graph at that point. And that's kind of visually how you think about the local linearization. And what I'm going to start doing here in this next video and in the ones following, is talking about quadratic approximations. So quadratic approximations, and these, these basically take these to the next level. And first I'll show what they look like graphically and then I'll show you what it actually means in formulas. But graphically instead of having a plane that's flat, you have a few more parameters to deal with, and you can give yourself some kind of surface that hugs the graph a little bit more closely. It's still going to be simpler in terms of formulas, it can still be notably simpler than the original function, but this actually hugs it closely. And as we move around the point that it's approximating here, the way that it hugs it can look pretty different. And if you want to think graphically what a quadratic approximation is, you can basically say if you slice this surface, this kind of ghostly white surface in any direction it'll look like a parabola of some kind. And notice that given that we're dealing in multiple dimensions that can make things look pretty complicated, like this right here, you know if you slice it kind of in this direction, whoa, if you look at it from this angle it kind of looks like a concave up parabola, but if you were looking at it from another direction it kind of looks concave down, and all-in-all you get a surface that actually has quite a bit of information carried within it. And you can see that by hugging the graph very closely this approximation is going to be, well, it's going to be even closer, because near the point where you're approximating you can go out, you know, you can take a couple steps away and the approximation is still going to be very close to what the graph is, and it's only when you step really far away from the original point that the approximation starts to deviate away from the graph itself. So this is going to be something that although it takes more information to describe than a local linearization it gives us a much closer approximation. So a linear function which, you know, one that just draws a plane like this, in terms of actual function what this means, so kind of a linear, this is going to be some kind of function of x and y, and what it looks like is some kind of constant, which I'll say a plus another constant times the variable x, plus another constant times the variable y, this is sort of the basic form of linear functions. And technically this isn't linear if one is going to be really pedantic and they would say that that's actually affine, because I'm strictly speaking linear functions shouldn't have this constant term, it should be purely x's and y's, but in the context of approximations people would usually call this a linear term. So quadratic term, what this is going to look like, quadratic, we are allowed to have all the same terms as that linear one, so you can have constant, you can have these two linear terms bx and cy, and then you're allowed to have anything that has two variables multiplied into it. So maybe I'll have d times x squared, and then you can also have something times xy, this is considered a quadratic term. Which is a little bit weird at first, because usually we think of quadratics as associated with that exponent two, but really it's just saying any time you have two variables multiplied in, and then we can add some other constants, say f times y squared. Where, you know, now we're multiplying two y's into it. So all of these guys, these are what you would call your quadratic terms. Things that either x squared, y squared, or x times y, anything that has two variables in it. So you can see this gives us a lot more control because previously, as we tweaked the constants a, b, and c, you're able to give yourself, you know, that gives you control over all sorts of planes in space, and if you choose the most optimal one you'll get one that's tangent to your curve at this specific point, and kind of, it'll depend on where that point is, you'll get different planes, but they're all tangent. So what we're going to do in the next couple of videos, is talk about how you tweak all of these six different constants so that you can get functions that really closely hug the curve, right? And as you, and they're all going to depend on the original point because as you move that point around, what it takes to hug the curve is going to be different. It's going to have to do with partial differential information about your original function, the function whose graph this is, and it's going to look pretty similar to the local linearization case, just you know, added complexity so we have to add a few more steps in there. And I'll see you next video talking about that.",math_multivariable-calculus_applications-of-multivariable-derivatives
" - We're told, divide the polynomials. The form of your answer should either be just a clean polynomial, or some polynomial plus some constant over x plus two, where p of x is a polynomial and k is an integer. Fair enough, and if we were doing this on Khan Academy, this is a screen shot from Khan Academy, we would have to type this in, but we're just going to do it by hand. And, like always, pause this video and try to do it on your own before we work through it together. All right, now let's work through it together. And what we're trying to do is divide x plus two, into three x to the third power plus four x squared minus three x plus seven. And so, like always, we focus on the highest degree terms first. x goes into three x to the third power how many times? Three x squared times. We'd want to put that in the second degree column. Three x squared. Three x squared times two is six x squared. Three x squared times x is three x to the third power. There's something very meditative about algebraic long division. Anyway, we'd want to subtract what we just wrote from what we have up here. So let's subtract. And these characters cancel out. And then four x squared minus six x squared is negative two x squared. Bring down that negative three x. And now we would wanna say, hey, how many times does x go into negative two x squared? Well, it would go negative two x times. Put that in our first degree column. Negative two x times two is negative four x. Negative two x times x is negative two x squared. Now we wanna subtract what we have here in orange from what we have up here in teal. So we either put a negative around the whole thing or we distribute that negative and that becomes a positive, that becomes a positive. And so this is equal to, the x squared terms cancel out. Negative three x plus four x is just going to be a straight up x. Bring down that seven, x plus seven. How many times does x go into x? Well, one time. Actually, let me do a, use a new color here. So, how many times does x go into x? It goes one time. Put that in the constant column. One times two is two. One times x is x. We wanna subtract these characters. And we're left with seven minus two is five. And so, we can rewrite this whole thing as, we deserve I guess a little bit of a drum roll. Three x squared minus two x plus one, plus the remainder, five, over x plus two. One way to think about it is, hey, I have this remainder, I'd have to keep dividing it by x plus two if I really wanted to figure out exactly what this is. Now if I wanted these expressions to be completely identical I would put a condition on the domain that x cannot be equal to negative two because if x was equal to negative two, we'd be dividing by zero here. But for the purposes of this exercise, you just have to input this part right over here, you'd have to type it in, which I guess isn't the easiest thing to do in the world. But it's worth doing. All right, see you in the next video.",math_math3_poly-div
" -  We're told that Linde isn't sure how to subtract 853. We are told Linde isn't sure how to subtract 853 minus 283. Help Linde by choosing an expression that is the same as 853 minus 283. So pause this video and see if you can answer it on your own before we work through it together. All right. Now when we look at all of the choices, they all start with 853. Now, this first choice, they subtract out 200. That makes sense 'cause we have 200s right over there. Then they subtract out 50 and then they subtract out three. So the 200 and the three make sense. You can view 853 minus 283 as 853 minus 200s minus 80, eight 10s right here, minus three. But that's not what they wrote in here. Instead of putting an 80 here, they put a 50, so we can rule that out. Here we have 253 minus 20 minus 800 minus three. Well, this is a little bit strange because we don't have two 10s, we have 200s, and we don't have 800s, we have eight 10s, so this is also incorrect. Now, it's probably going to be this one, but let's just make sure we feel comfortable with this. So this one has 853 minus 200 minus 50 minus 30. Does that make sense? Well, let's think about it. What they're doing is that they're subtracting out first the 200, so that's this part right over here, so that makes sense, they're subtracting out first that. And then they're subtracting out 53 and then they're subtracting out 30. Well, that is the same thing as subtracting out 83 'cause subtracting 83 is the same thing as subtracting out 53, and then subtracting 30. 53 plus 30 is 83. Now, you might be wondering, why would they even do it this way? What's easier to do in your head? 853 minus 200 is 653. You take away 53 from that, so you take away 53 from that, and you're going to be left with 600, and then 600 minus 30, you might recognize that, you could use the 60 10s minus three 10s, this is gonna be 57 10s or you might be able to do it in your head, 600 minus 30 is 570. So that's why they broke out, they broke up the 83. Instead of just breaking it up into 80 and three, they broke it up into 53 and 30 to match this 53 over here, and so it was easier to work out the result. Let's do another example. So here we're asked to fill in the blank. They say 143 minus 79 is the same as blank minus 80. So pause this video and see if you can figure this out. So the key here is to realize is that when you have a difference here, as long as you add or subtract the same amount to both of these, the difference will be the same. So it looks like they tried to turn the 79 into, it looks like they turned the 79 into an 80 by adding one, and so if we want the difference to be the same, we would add one to the 143 as well. So 143 plus one is 144. If we add one to both of these numbers, the difference would be the same. And we're done. So, it's 144 minus 80.",math_cc-third-grade-math_imp-addition-and-subtraction
" We're asked to write this right here in word form, and I'm not saying it out loud because that would give the answer away. We have 63.15 that we want to write in word form. Well, the stuff to the left of the decimal point is pretty straightforward. Let me actually color code it. So we have 6, 3. Let me do it all in different colors. And then we have a decimal, and then we have a 1 and a 5. There's one common way of doing this, but we'll talk about the different ways you could express this as a word. But we know how to write this stuff to the left. This is pretty straightforward. This is just sixty-three. Let me write that down. So this is sixty-three. And instead of the decimal, we'll write, and. Now there's two ways to go here. We could say, and one tenth and five hundredths, or we could just say, look, this is fifteen hundredths. One tenth is ten hundredths. So one tenth and five hundredths is fifteen hundredths. So maybe I can write it like this: sixty-three and fifteen hundredths. Just like that. Now, it might have been a little bit more natural to say, how come I don't say one tenth and then five hundredths? And you could, but that would just make it a little bit harder for someone's brain to process it when you say it. So it could have been sixty-three-- so let me copy and paste that. It could be sixty-three and, and then you would write, one tenth for this digit right there, and five hundredths. Sixty-three and one tenth and five hundredths is hard for most people's brains to process. But if you say, fifteen hundredths, people get what you're saying. Not to beat a dead horse, but this right here, this is 1/10 right here and then this is 5/100, 5 over 100. But if you were to add these two, If you were to add 1/10 plus 5/100 -- so let's do that. If you were to add 1/10 plus 5/100, how would you do it? You need a common denominator. 100 is divisible by both 10 and 100, so multiply both the numerator and denominator of this character by 10. You get 10 on the top and 100 on the bottom. 1/10 is the same thing as 10 over 100. 10/100 plus 5/100 is equal to 15 over 100, so this piece right here is equal to 15/100. And that's why we say sixty-three and fifteen hundredths.",math_cc-fifth-grade-math_imp-place-value-and-decimals
" -  We are told figure two is a scaled copy of figure one. So this is figure two here. This is figure one. Looks like figure two not only has it been scaled down, it's a smaller version, but it also looks like it has been rotated 180 degrees or you can say it's been flipped upside down. We're asked to identify the side in figure two that corresponds to side EA in figure one. So this is EA in figure one. Pause this video and see if you can identify the side of figure two that corresponds to side EA in figure one. Alright, now let's work through this together. Some of you might immediately intuit or be able to spot which side corresponds to EA but I'll do it slightly more methodically in this video just so that we can see maybe all of the corresponding sides and points. So one way to think about it is well, it looks like the longest side in figure one is side BC. So this is the longest side in figure one and then the longest side in figure two is HL so it looks like BC corresponds to HL and then touching on that longest side, that longest side has two right angles. It forms two right angles with the sides next to it. So you have these two right angles right over here and then of those two right angles, you have the shorter side connected to the longest side and so that is BA over here and so that would correspond to LK right over here. That is the shorter side connected to the long side that forms a right angle and then if we just keep following that side of the shape, we then go to side AE which would correspond now to and this is answering our question to side KJ. So the side in figure two that corresponds to EA in figure one, that is going to be KJ or we could say side JK and if someone wanted to say what points correspond to which point, well, you can see that BA corresponds to LK and BC corresponds to LH so we would know for example that this point B right over here, point B would correspond to point L in figure two right over here and we could use a similar logic for the other points. So we've answered the questions, the question, but the real thing is to see well, which sides or points have similar features on a relative basis? So I said what is the longest side? What is the longest side? Where do we see right angles? And sometimes your brain might just immediately be able to spot out the shape. If you were to rotate this one all the way around, it would jump out at you a little bit faster that JK and AE are corresponding sides.",math_7th-engage-ny_engage-7th-module-4
" What I want to do in this video is revisit a little bit of what we know about pi, and really how we measure angles in radians. And then think about whether pi is necessarily the best number to be paying attention to. So let's think a little bit about what I just said. So pi, we know, is defined-- and I'll write defined as a triple equal sign, I guess you could call it that way-- pi is defined as the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, which is the same thing as the ratio of the circumference of the circle to two times the radius. And from that, we get all these interesting formulas that you get in geometry class that, hey, if you have the radius and you want to calculate the circumference, multiply both sides of this definition, or this equation, by two times the radius. And you get two times the radius times pi is equal to the circumference, or more familiarly, it would be circumference is equal to 2 pi r. This is one of those fundamental things that you learn early on in your career and you use it to find circumferences, usually, or figure out radiuses if you know circumference. And from that comes how we measure our angles in radians once we get to trigonometry class. And just as a review here, let me draw myself a circle. Let me draw myself a better circle. So there is my-- it'll do the job. And here is the positive x-axis, and let me make some angle here. I'll make the angle kind of obvious just so that it-- so let me make this angle. And the way that we measure angles, when we talk about radians, we're really talking about the angle subtended by something of a certain arc length. And we measure the arc length in-- well, the way I like to think about it, is the angle is in radians and the arc length itself is in radiuses, which isn't really a word. But that's how I think about it. How many radiuses is this arc length that subtends the angle in radians? So let me show you what I'm talking about. So this arc length right here, if the radius is r, what is the length of this arc length? Well, we know from basic geometry the entire circumference over here is going to be 2 pi r, right? This entire circumference, that's really by definition, this entire circumference is going to be 2 pi r. So what is just this arc length here? And I'm assuming this is a fourth of the circle. So it's going to be 2 pi r over 4. So this arc length over here is going to be 2 pi r over 4, which is the same thing as pi over 2 r. Or you could say this is the same thing as pi over 2 radiuses. One of those-- you know, not a real word, but that's how I like to think about it. Or you could say it subtends an angle of pi over 2 radians. So over here, theta is pi over 2 radians. And so really, when you're measuring angles in radians, it's really you're saying, OK, that angle subtended by an arc that has a length of how many radiusi, or I don't even know what the plural of radius is. Actually, I think it's radii but it's fun to try to say radiuses. Radii, actually let me do that just so no one says, Sal, you're teaching people the wrong plural form of radius. Radii. So this arc length is pi over 2 radii and it subtends an angle of pi over 2 radians. We could do another one just for the sake of making the point clear. If you went all the way around the circle and you got back to the positive x-axis here, what is the arc length? Well now, all of a sudden the arc length is the entire circumference of the circle. It would be 2 pi r, which is the same thing as 2 pi radii. And we would say that the angle subtended by this arc length, the angle that we care about going all the way around the circle, is 2 pi radians. And so, out of this comes all of the things that we know about how to graph trigonometric functions or at least how we measure the graph on the x-axis. And I'll also touch on Euler's formula, which is the most beautiful formula, I think, in all of mathematics. And let's visit those right now, just to remind ourselves of how pi fits in to all of that. So if I think about our trigonometric functions. Remember, if this was-- so on trigonometric functions, we assume we have a unit circle here. So in the trig functions, this is the unit circle definition of the trig function. So this is a nice review of all of that. You assume you have a unit circle, a circle of radius 1. And then the trig functions are defined as, for any angle you have here, for any angle, theta, cosine of theta is how far you have to move in-- or the x-coordinate of the point along the arc that subtends this angle. So that's cosine of theta. And then sine of theta is the y value of that point. Let me make that clear. Cosine of theta is the x value, sine of theta is the y value. And so if you were to graph one of these functions, and I'll just do sine of theta for convenience. But you could try it with cosine of theta. So let's graph sine of theta. Let's do one revolution of sine of theta. And we tend to label it-- so let's do sine. When the angle is 0, sine of theta is 0. Let me draw the x- and y-axis just so you remember. This is the y-axis and this is the x-axis. So when the angle is 0, we're right here on the unit circle. The y value there is 0. So sine of theta is going to be right like that. Let me draw it like this. So this is our theta, and this is-- I'm going to graph sine of theta along the y-axis. So we'll say y is equal to sine of theta in this graph that I'm drawing right over here. And then we could do-- well, I'll just do the simple points here. And then if we make the angle go-- if we did it in degrees, 90 degrees, or if we do it in radians, pi over 2 radians. What is sine of theta? Well, now it is 1. This is the unit circle. It has a radius 1. So when theta is equal to pi over 2, then sine of theta is equal to 1. So if this is 1 right here, sine of theta is equal to 1. If theta-- and then if we go 180 degrees or halfway around the circle-- theta is now equal to pi. Let me do this in a color, orange. I have already used orange. Theta is now equal to pi. When theta is equal to pi, the y value of this point right here is once again 0. So we go back to 0. Remember, we're talking about sine of theta. And then we can go all the way down here, where you can see there's 270 degrees. Or you could view this as 3 pi over 2 radians. So this is in radians, this axis. So 3 pi over 2 radians, sine of theta is the y-coordinate on the unit circle right over here. So it's going to be negative 1. So this is negative 1. And then finally, when you go all the way around the circle, you've gone 2 pi radians, and you're back where you began. And the sine of theta, or the y-coordinate, is now 0 once again. And if you connect the dots, or if you'd plotted more points, you would see a sine curve over just the part that we've graphed right over here. So that's another application. You say hey, Sal, where is this going? Well I'm showing you-- I'm reminding you of all of these things because we're going to revisit it with a different number other than pi. And so I want to do one last visit with pi. You say, look, pi is powerful because-- or one of the reasons why pi seems to have some type of mystical power, and we've shown this in the calculus playlist-- is Euler's formula, that e to the i theta is equal to cosine of theta plus i sine of theta. This, by itself, is just a crazy-- it's just one of those mind boggling formulas. But it sometimes looks even more mind boggling when you put pi in for theta because then, from Euler's formula, you would get e to the i pi is equal to-- well, what's cosine of pi? Cosine of pi is negative 1. And then sine of pi is 0. So 0 times i. So you get this formula, which is pretty profound, and then you say, OK, if I want to put all of the fundamental numbers together in one formula, I can add 1 to both sides of this. And you get e to the i pi plus 1 is equal to 0. Sometimes this is called Euler's Identity, the most beautiful formula or equation in all of mathematics. And it is pretty profound. You have all of the fundamental numbers in one equation. e, i, pi, 1, 0, although for my aesthetic taste it would have been even more powerful if this was a 1 right over here. Because then this would have said, look, e to the i pi, this bizarre thing, would have equaled unity. 1That would have been super duper profound to me. 1It seems a little bit of a hack to add 1 to both sides 1and say, oh, look, now I have 0 here. 1But this is pretty darn good. 1But with that, I'm going to make-- well, 1I'm not going to argue for it. 1I'm going to show an argument for another number, 1a number different than pi. 1And I want to make it clear that these ideas are not my own. 1It comes from-- well, it's inspired 1by-- many people are on this movement now, the Tau Movement, 1but these are kind of the people that 1gave me the thinking on this. 1And the first is Robert Palais on ""Pi is Wrong."" 1And he doesn't argue that pi is calculated wrong. 1He still agrees that it is the ratio of the circumference 1to the diameter of a circle that is 3.14159. 1But what he's saying is that we're paying attention 1to the wrong number. 1And also, you have Michael Hartl, ""The Tau Manifesto."" 1All of this is available online. 1And what they argue for is a number called tau, 1or what they call tau. 1And they define tau, and it's a very simple change from pi. 1They define tau not as the ratio of the circumference 1the diameter, or the ratio of the circumference to 2 times 1the radius. 1They say, hey, wouldn't it be natural to define 1some number, the ratio of the circumference to the radius? 1And as you see here, this pi is just one half times 1this over here, right? 1Circumference over 2 r, this the same thing as one half times 1circumference over r. 1So pi is just half of tau. 1Or another way to think about it is that tau is just 2 times pi. 1Or, and I'm sure you probably don't 1have this memorized, because you're like, wait, 1I spent all my life memorizing pi, 1but it's 6.283185 and keeps going on and on and on, 1never repeating just like pi. 1It's 2 times pi. 1And so you're saying, hey Sal, pi 1has been around for millennia, really. 1Why mess with such a fundamental number, 1especially when you just spent all this time 1showing how profound it is? 1And the argument that they'd make, 1and it seems like a pretty good argument, 1is that actually things seem a little bit more elegant when 1you pay attention to this number instead of half of this number, 1when you pay attention to tau. 1And to see that, let's revisit everything that we did here. 1Now, all of a sudden, if you pay attention to 2 pi, 1as opposed to pi. 1Or we should call it-- if you pay attention 1to tau instead of tau over 2. 1What is this angle that we did in magenta? 1Well first of all, let's think about this formula right 1over here. 1What is the circumference in terms of the radius? 1Well, now we could say the circumference 1is equal to tau times the radius because tau 1is the same thing as 2 pi. 1So it makes that formula a little bit neater, although it 1does make the pi r squared a little bit messier. 1So you could argue both sides of that. 1But it makes the measure of radians much more intuitive 1because you could say that this is pi over 2 radians, 1or you could say that this is pi over 2 radians is 1the same thing as to tau over 4 radians. 1And where did I get that from? 1Remember, if you go all the way around the circle, that 1is the circumference. 1The arc length would be the circumference. 1It would be tau radii, or it would 1be to tau radians would be the angle subtended by that arc 1length. 1It would be tau radians. 1All the way around is tau radians. 1So that by itself is intuitive. 1One revolution is one tau radians. 1If you go only one fourth of that, 1it's going to be tau over four radians. 1So the reason why tau is more intuitive 1here is because it immediately-- you 1don't have to do this weird conversion 1where you saying, oh, divide by 2, multiply by 2, all that. 1You're just like, look, however many radians in terms of tau, 1that's really how many revolutions you've 1gone around the circle. 1And so, if you've gone one fourth around, 1that's tau over four radians. 1If you've gone halfway around, that'd be tau over two radians. 1If you go 3/4 around that'd be three tau over four radians. 1If you go all the way around that would be tau radians. 1If someone tells you that they have an angle of 10 tau 1radians, you'd go around exactly 10 times. 1It would be much more intuitive. 1You wouldn't have to do this little mental math, converting, 1saying, do I multiply or divide by 2 1when I convert to radians in terms of pi? 1No, when you do it in terms of tau radians, it's just natural. 1One revolution is one tau radians. 1So that makes-- and it makes a sine function over here. 1Instead of writing pi over 2-- well, 1when you look at a graph like this 1you're like, where was this on the unit circle? 1Was this one fourth around the circle? 1Was this one half? 1And this is actually one fourth around the circle, 1right over here? 1But now it becomes obvious if you write it in tau. 1Pi over 2 is the same thing as to tau over 4. 1Pi is the same thing as to tau over 2. 13 pi over 2 is 3 pi-- oh, sorry, 3 tau over 4, 3/4 tau. 1And then one revolution is tau. 1And then immediately, now when you look at it this way, 1you know exactly where you are in the unit circle. 1You're one fourth around the unit circle, 1you're halfway around the unit circle, 1you're 3/4 of the way around the unit circle. 1And then you're all the way around the unit circle. 1And so the last thing that I think the strong pi 1defenders would say is well, look Sal, 1you just pointed out one of the most beautiful identities 1or formulas in mathematics. 1How does tau hold up to this? 1Well, let's just try it out and see what happens. 1So if we take e to the i tau, that will give us cosine of tau 1plus i sine of tau. 1And once again, let's just think about what this is. 1Tau radians means we've gone all the way around the unit circle. 1So cosine of tau-- remember, we're 1back at the beginning of the unit circle 1right over here-- so cosine of tau is going to be equal to 1. 1And then sine of tau is equal to 0. 1So e to the i tau is equal to 1. 1And I'll leave it up to you to decide 1which one seems to be more aesthetically profound.",math_trigonometry_unit-circle-trig-func
"  In order to see how to form enolate anions, and in this video we're just gonna look in more detail how to form enolate anions from ketones. And so the ketone we have here is acetone. To find our alpha carbon, we just look at the carbon next to our carbonyl carbon, so this could be an alpha carbon, and this could be an alpha carbon. Each one of those alpha carbons has three alpha protons, and so there's a total of six. I'm just gonna draw one in here, and this is the one that we're going to show being deprotonated here. So, the base that's going to deprotonate acetone, we're gonna use LDA, which is Lithium Diisopropyl Amide And, I could go ahead and draw in the Lithium here, so Li Plus, and then we see the two isopropyl groups like that, a negative one charge on our nitrogen. So this is a very strong base, it's also very bulky and sterically hindered. So you can think about a lone pair of electrons in the nitrogen, taking that proton, leaving these electrons behind on this carbon, so we can go ahead and draw the conjugate base here. We would have electrons on this carbon now, that's a carbanion, so let me go ahead and show those electrons, these electrons in here magenta, are gonna come off onto this carbon. And this carbon is a [carbanae] because remember there's also two other hydrogens attached to it. So that's what gives it a negative one formal charge here. We can draw our resoce structure, we can show these electrons in magenta moving in here, these electrons coming off onto our oxygen, so for our resoce structure we would show the negative charge is now on our oxygen, this would be a negative one formal charge like that now. So the electrons in magenta moved into here to form our double bond, and then we can show the electrons in here in the blue moving out onto the oxygen. So this is our enolate anion, right, this represents our enolate anion, and for our two resoce structures, we have one with the negative charge on the carbon, so it's our carbanion, and one with our negative charge on our oxygen, that's our oxyanion. Remember the oxyanion contributes more to the overall hybrid because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, so that's our enolate anion that is formed. So, if we form our enolate anion, we're also gonna get another product. So if I think about adding a proton onto our base, we're going to form an amines. Let me go ahead and draw the amine that we would make. So we would have, it would now be this amine. So let's show those electrons. So the electrons over here in red, these electrons right here pick up this proton forming this bond and we'd form an amine. So this reaction is at equilibrium. So to figure out which direction this favors, one way to do it would be to calculate the Keq. And you can see over here on the left, these ways for calculating the Keq, which we talked about in the last video, We first need to calculate the pKeq, which would be the pKa of the acid on the left, so the acid on the left would be acetone with a pKa of approximately 19 or sometimes you'll see 20, and so from that number we're going to subtract the pKa of the acid on the right, which would be our amine. The pKa of this is approximately 36, so 19 minus 36 gives us negative 17. To find the Keq, all we do is take 10 to the negative of that number, so 10 to the negative of negative 17 is the same thing as 10 to the 17th, which is obviously a huge number, much, much greater than one, so we know that the equilibrium lies to the right. So the equilibrium favors formation of the enolate anions, and for all practical purposes, this is a huge number, you're pretty much gonna get complete formation of your enolate anions, so if you add LDA to acetone you're gonna get again, pretty much all enolate anion, and none of your acetone will remain here. Another way of figuring that out is to know that the equilibrium favors formation of the weaker acid. The weaker acid is the one with the higher value for the pKa, remember the lower the pKa the more acidic something is, so acetone is more acidic than this amine, and so since the amine has the higher value for the pKa, the equilibrium favors formation of this weaker acid, also to the right like that. Alright, so let's talk about the pKa of acetone or ketones in general compared to aldehydes. So this pKa is higher than that for our aldehyde like we saw in the last video, and we can think about why by looking at the enolate anion and thinking about the fact that now we have a methyl group here, and alkyl groups are electron donating so, if it's donating a little bit of electron density, it already has a negative charge on it, so donating a little bit of electron density would destabalize this negative charge a little bit. So if the conjugate base is destabalized, that means that acetone is not quite as likely to donate a proton. So that's the situation when you have a ketone here. When we had an aldehyde, we didn't have this electron donating factor, and so that's just one way to think about why an acetone, why a ketone, is not as acidic as an aldehyde in general. Alright, here's an example where we have a very acidic ketone. So this is a special kind of ketone called a beta-diketone, this is a beta-diketone here. And if we look for alpha carbons, we look for the carbon next to our carbonyl, so this is an alpha carbon, this is an alpha carbon, and this is an alpha carbon, And so the question is which one of those, which one of those alpha carbons is the one that has the most acidic protons. It turns out to be the alpha carbon in the center, the one between our two carbonyls, and so there are two alpha protons on that carbon. And so the pKa for one of those, for one of those acidic protons is about nine, so that's very acidic, much more acidic than acetone or acetaldehyde like we talked about in the last video. And so since a beta diketone has such acidic protons, we don't need a super strong base like LDA, we can use something like sodium ethoxide, so negative one formal charge here on this oxygen, so sodium ethoxide could be used to deprotonate this beta diketone. So we think about one pair of electrons taking this proton, leaving these electrons behind on this carbon. So let's go ahead and draw the conjugate base, so we would have our carbonyls here, and we took a proton away, so now we have our electrons on this carbon, so a negative one formal charge. So these electrons right in here, magenta, moved onto this carbon, which gives this carbon negative one formal charge, because there's still a hydrogen bonded to that carbon, I'm just not drawing it in so we can see a little bit better. For resoce structures, we could show these electrons in magenta moving into here, pushing these electrons off onto the oxygen, so we could draw a resoce structure for that. So for our resoce structure, we would form a double bond here, and then this oxygen would get a negative one formal charge like that. And then our carbonyl on the right is still here like that. So that's one of our possible resoce structures, electrons in magenta moved in here to form our double bond, and then we could show these electrons in here moving off onto our oxygen like that. We could have shown our electrons moving over on this side as well, so we can push those electrons off. So let's go ahead and draw another resoce structure here. So let's get some room and let's show the formation of another resoce structure. This time our carbonyl on the left is still there. We moved some electrons into here, and then we would form a negative one charge on this oxygen, so a negative one charge right here like that. And so let's show those electrons, electrons in red move in to form our double bond, and then let's show these electrons in here coming off onto this oxygen like that. So a total of three resoce structures for this enolate anion. And so you could see this negative one formal charge is delocalized, right, it's delocalized over this carbon, it's delocalized on this oxygen, it's delocalized on this oxygen. So the more you delocalize, or spread out a negative charge, the more you stabalize the anion. So this is a very stable anion because of resoce and also because of conjugation. If you think about, if you think about the conjugation present here, so here's a double bond, and here's a single bond, and then here's a double bond. So you have some conjugation stabalizing it as well. And so we have a very stable conjugate base for all those reasons that we just talked about. And since we have a stable conjugate base, this beta diketone is likely to donate one of these protons, and so that's why it's pKa value is so low. Alright, so if ethoxide takes one of these acidic protons, we're gonna form ethanol as our other product. So we can go ahead and draw ethanol in here like that, and then we can calculate the Keq for this reaction. So ethanol's pKa we've already seen is approximately 16, so if I want to calculate the Keq, first we find the pKeq. So the pKa of the acid on the left, the acid on the left is this beta diketone, so that'd be nine, from that number we subtract the pKa of the acid on the right, which is ethanol, so nine minus 16 gives us negative seven, so that's the pKeq. To find the Keq, we take 10 to the negative of that number. So 10 to the negative of negative seven, is of course the same thing as 10 to the seventh, and obviously that's a number much, much greater than one. And so we know the equilibrium lies to the right, favoring formation of the enolate anion here. So favoring formation of our enolate anion. So for all practical purposes we're gonna get pretty much nearly complete formation of our enolate anion. 1And so, we're gonna get our enolate anion, 1and that's because even though we use 1sodium ethoxide, it's not as strong of a base as 1LDA, but it's enough, it's enough to deprotonate 1our very acidic beta diketone.",science_organic-chemistry_ochem-alpha-carbon-chemistry
" -  What I have listed here is several of the derivative rules that we've used in previous videos. If these things look unfamiliar to you I encourage you to maybe to not watch this video because in this video we're going to think about when do we apply these rules? What strategies and can we algebraically convert expressions so that we can use a simpler rule? But this is a quick review, this is of course the power rule right over here, very handy for taking derivatives of X raised to some power. It's also we can use that with the derivative properties of sums of derivatives or differences of derivatives to take derivatives of polynomials. This right over here is the product rule. If I have an expression that I want to take the derivative of and I can think of it as the product of two functions, well then the derivative is going to be the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second. Once again if this looks completely unfamiliar to you or you're a little shaky, go watch the videos, do the practice on the power rule and the product rule, or in this case the quotient rule. And the quotient rule is a little bit more involved and we have practicing videos on that and I always have mixed feelings about it because if you don't remember the quotient rule, you can usually or you can always convert a quotient into a product by expressing this thing at the bottom as F of X times G of X to the negative one. So you could take the derivative with a combination of the products and this fourth rule over here, the chain rule. And if any of this is looking unfamiliar again don't watch this video, this video is for folks who are familiar with each of these derivative rules or derivative techniques and now want to think about well what are strategies for deciding when to apply which. So let's do that. Let's say that I have the expression, let's say I'm interested in taking the derivative of X squared plus X minus two over X minus one. Which of these rules or techniques would you use? Well you might immediately say hey look this looks like a rational expression, I could say this is my F of X right over here, I could say this is my G of X right over here and I could apply the quotient rule, this looks like a quotient of two expressions. And you could do that and if you do all the mathematics correctly, you will get the correct answer. But in this case it's good to just take a little time to realize well can I simplify this algebraically so maybe I can do a little bit less work? And if you look at it that way, you might realize wait what if I factored this numerator I can factor it as X plus two times X minus one. And then I could cancel these two characters out and I can say hey you know what this is going to be the same thing as the derivative with respect to X of X plus two. Derivative with respect to X of X plus two, which is much much much much more straightforward than trying to apply the quotient rule. Here you would just take the derivative with respect to X of X which is just going to be one and the derivative with respect to X of two is just going to be zero and so all of this is going to simplify to one. If we're taking the derivative of that, you're essentially just using the power rule. And so once again just a simple algebraic recognition things become much more simple. Let's do another example. So let's say that you were to see, or someone were to ask you to take the derivative with respect to X of, let me see, so let's say you had X squared plus two X minus five over X. So once again you might be tempted to use the quotient rule, this looks like the quotient of two expressions. But then you might realize there's some algebraic manipulations I could do to make this simpler. You could express this as a product, you could say that this is the same thing as, and I'm just going to focus on what's inside the parentheses or inside the brackets, this is the same thing as X to the negative one times X squared plus 2x minus five and then you might want to apply the product rule. But there's even a better simplification here. You could just divide each of these terms by X or one way to think about it distribute this one over X across all the terms, X to the negative one is the same thing as one over X and if you do that X squared divided by X is going to be X. 2x divided by X is going to be two and then negative five divided by X, well you could write that as negative five over X or negative five X to the negative one. And now I'm taking the derivative of this with respect to X is much easier than using either the quotient or the power rule. This is going to be, let's see the derivative of that is going to be one, derivative of two is going to be zero and here even though you have a negative exponent, it might look a little intimidating, this is just taken using the power rule. So negative one times negative five is positive five X to the, if we take one less than negative one we're going to go the negative two power. So once again making this algebraic recognition simplified things a good bit. Let's do a few more examples of just starting to recognize when we might be able to simplify things to do things a little bit easier. So let's say that someone said hey you take the derivative with respect to X and I'm using X as our variable that we're taking the derivative of with respect to but obviously this works for any variables that we are using. So let's say we're saying square root of X over X squared. Pause this video and think about how would you approach this if you want to take the derivative with respect to X of the square root of X over X squared. Well once again you might say this is a quotient of two expressions, might try to apply the quotient rule, or you might recognize well look this is the same thing, let me just focus on what's inside the brackets, you could view this as X to the negative two times the square root of X and then you might want to use the product rule but you could simplify this even better. You could say this is the same thing as X to the negative two times X to the one half power and now just using our exponent properties, negative two plus one half is negative three halves, so this is the derivative X to the negative three halves power. And so here once again we took something that we thought we might have to use the quotient rule or use the product rule and now this just becomes a straightforward using the power rule. So this is just going to be equal to, so bring the negative three halves out front, negative three halves, X to the negative three halves minus one is negative five halves power. So once again just before you, especially if you're about to apply the quotient rule and sometimes even the product rule, just see is there an algebraic simplification, sometimes a trigonometric simplification that you can make that eases your job that makes things less hairy? As a general tip I can't say this is going to be always true but if you're taking some type of exam and you're going down some really hairy route which the quotient rule will often take you, it's a good sign that hey take a pause before trying to run through all of that algebra to apply the quotient rule and see if you can simplify things. So let's give another example. In this one there's not an obvious way and it really depends on what folks' preferences are, but let's say you want to take the derivative with respect to X of one over 2x to the negative five, sorry, one over 2x minus five I should say. Well here you could immediately apply the quotient rule here the numerator you view that as F of X. You could view this as the same thing as the derivative with respect to X. Instead of 2x minus five, let me do that in the blue color. 2x minus five to the negative one power. In this situation, you would use a combination of the power rule and the chain rule. You would say okay my G of X is 2x minus five and F of G of X is going to be this whole expression. And so if you applied the chain rule, this is going to be the derivative of the outside function, our F of X with respect to the inside function. The derivative of F of G of X with respect to G of X. So it's going to be negative, we'll bring that negative out front, so we're essentially just going to use the power rule here. Negative 2x minus five to the negative two and then we multiply that times the derivative of the inside function. So the inside function's derivative, the derivative of 2x is two, the derivative of negative five is zero so it's going to be times two and of course you can simplify so it's a negative two times all of this business. Let me do one more example here just to hit the point home and once again there isn't a must way, there isn't a way that you have to do this, but just let you appreciate that there's multiple ways to approach these types of derivatives. So let's say someone said take the derivative of 2x plus one squared. Pause the video and think about how you would do that. Well one way to do it is just to apply the chain rule 1just like we just did. 1So you could say alright here's going to be the derivative 1of the outside with respect to the inside. 1So it's going to be two times 2x plus one to the first 1power, taking one less than that times the derivative 1of the inside which is just going to be two and so this 1is going to be equal to four times 2x plus one, 1which is equal to, if we want to distribute the four, 1we could say it's 8x plus four. 1That's a completely legitimate way of doing it. 1Now there are other ways of doing it. 1You could expand out to X plus one squared. 1You could say hey this is the same thing as the derivative 1with respect to X of 2x squared is going to be 4x squared 1and then two times the product of these terms is going 1to be plus 4x plus one. 1And now you would just apply the power rule. 1It's a little bit of extra algebra up front but you can 1just go straightforward with the power rule and you're 1going to get this exact same thing. 1So the whole takeaway here is pause look at your expression. 1See if there's a way to simplify it and it's especially 1a good thing if you can get out of using the quotient rule 1'cause that sometimes is just hard to know or remember 1and even when you do remember it, it can get quite hairy 1quite fast.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-differentiation-2-new
" -  Over here, we have the graph of the function Y is equal to E to the X. Actually, let me make that clear. That right over there is Y is equal to E to the X. This is, of course, our X axis. This is our Y axis. And so, this blue area right over here, this blue area, we can denote that as the definite integral from zero to one of E to the X, DX and let's say we know in the future, we'll learn how to come up with this number but let's just say we know that that area is equal to E minus one. Given that, I have these other three definite integrals and what I encourage you to do is try to pause this video and try to evaluate what this three other definite integrals are using only this information and what we already know about definite integral properties. I am assuming that you have given a go at it. You might first say, okay, let's see E to the X plus two. You might be tempted to decompose this into definite integral of E to the X, DX plus the definite integral from one to-- So that you could decompose this from one to one at E to X, DX plus one to one, plus the definite integral from one to one of two DX but you have to remember if you're taking the definite integral where your bounds are the same. This is the definite integral from one to one. This is going to be zero. This is going to be equal to zero. Once again, you can imagine that you're trying to find the area of something that has no width. You're not moving at all. You have no width along the X axis here. That was pretty straightforward. From one to one, your area is going to be zero. Now, let's think through this one over here. Here my bounds are different. They are the same as these bounds right over here. I guess that gives me a pretty good clue that maybe if I can break this up a little bit, especially if one of these is in the form of E to the X, I might be able to evaluate this definite integral. Let's do that. The first thing I could do is I could break this up as the definite integral from zero to one of 3DX and then I could say Plus the definite integral from zero to one of negative E to the X, DX and then I can take the negative. That negative is really just a negative one. We saw that you could take that scaling factor out of the integral so let's do that. This is the same thing as the integral from zero to one. 3DX minus the integral from zero to one, E to the X, DX. Well, lucky for us, we already know what, let me do this in that same color. We already know what this, I have trouble changing colors. We already know what this right over here is. That's going to be equal to E minus one. If you subtract an E minus one, you're going to get, actually, let me just write it out so we don�t get confused. We're going to subtract an E minus one, what is this going to be equal to? The definite integral from zero to one of 3DX. We just have to graph that to imagine it. We're going from zero to one and the function is that one, two, three. I'm not doing it at the same scale. The function looks like that. This right over here is just this area. Under the function F of X is equal to three. from zero to one So, what's this area? Well, this is just our base. Our width is one. Our height is three. This is just going to evaluate to three. That's just going to be equal to three and so, this is going to be equal to three and you're going to have minus E, just distributing the negative side and then plus one. And then of course, three plus one is going to be equal to four. This is going to be equal to four minus four, minus E and we're done. We're able to solve or I guess we say, evaluate or find the value of this definite integral using only integration properties in the value of this definite integral. Now, what about this one over here? This one is interesting way. I have different bounds here. Definitely go from two to three. Having E to X minus two. And when you see something like this, especially, if you're trying to evaluate this only with integration properties, the big thing that may or may not jump out of you is that E to the X minus two is shifted version of E to the X. It's shifted by two to the right. Let me draw that. Instead of this point being there, this point is going to be there and so, the curve is going to look something like let me draw my best attempt. My best attempt to do it. It's going to be like there. It's going to be like there. It's going to look something. I'm trying my best to just shift it over. So each of these, this is going to be shifted to right over here. There you go. E to the X minus two. We're going from two to three and so, what are the bounds now? The bounds are from two to three. We're going from this point right over here to three, which is going to be over here. Just going to be over here. Take this point, you shift one and two. You're going to get right over here and what do we just do? We're thinking about this area right over here. We shifted the curve over to the right by two. This is the curve of E to the X minus two and we shifted the interval event that we're trying to find the area under. We shifted that by two. This is going to have the exact same area. I just shifted everything to the right by two. This area is also going to be E minus one. In my mind, this one's a little bit tricky. You just have to realize that this is just a shifted version of that and that we also shifted the two bounds to the right and we already saw that in one of the integration property videos.",math_old-integral-calculus_definite-integrals-intro-ic
" -  A nutritionist wants to estimate the average caloric content of the burritos at a popular restaurant. They obtain a random sample of 14 burritos and measure their caloric content. Their sample data are roughly symmetric with a mean of 700 calories and a standard deviation of 50 calories. Based on this sample, which of the following is a 95% confidence interval for the mean caloric content of these burritos? So, pause this video and see if you can figure it out. All right, what's going on here? So, there's a population of burritos here. There is a mean caloric content that the nutritionist wants to figure out but doesn't know the true population parameter here, the population mean and so, the take a sample of 14 burritos and they calculate some sample statistics. They calculate the sample mean which is 700, they also calculate the sample standard deviation which is equal to 50 and they want to use this data to construct a 95% confidence interval and so, our confidence interval is going to take the form and we've seen this before, our sample mean plus or minus our critical value times the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of N. The reason why we're using a T statistic is because we don't know the actual standard deviation for the population. If we knew the standard deviation for the population, we would use that instead of our sample standard deviation and if we use that, if we use sigma which is a population parameter then we could use a Z statistic right over here, we would use a Z distribution but since we're using this sample standard deviation, that's why we're using a T statistic but now let's do that. So, what is this going to be? So, our sample mean is 700, they tell us that, so it's going to be 700 plus or minus, so what would be our critical value for a 95% confidence interval? Well, we will just get out our T table and with the T table, remember, you have to care about degrees of freedom and if our sample size is 14, then that means you take 14 minus one, so degrees of freedom is N minus one, so that's gonna be 14 minus one is equal to 13. So, we have 13 degrees of freedom that we have to keep in mind when we look at our T table, so let's look at our T table, so 95% confidence interval and 13 degrees of freedom, so degrees of freedom right over here, so we have 13 degrees of freedom, so that is this row right over here and if we want a 95% confidence level, then that means our tail probability, remember, if our distribution, let me see, I'll draw it really small, a little small distribution right over here, so if you want 95% of the area in the middle, that means you have five percent not shaded in and that's evenly divided on each side, so that means you have two and a half percent at the tails, two and a half percent, so what you want to look for is the tail probability of two and a half percent. So, that is this right over here, .025, that two and a half percent and so, there you go, that is our critical value, 2.160. So, this part right over here, so this is going to be two, let me do that in a darker color, this is going to be 2.160 times what's our sample standard deviation? It's 50 over the square root of N, square root of 14, so all of our choices have the 700 there, so we just need to figure out what our margin of error, this part of it and we could use a calculator for that. Okay, 2.16, ic an write a zero there, it doesn't really matter, times 50 divided by the square root of 14, we get a little bit of a drum roll here I think, 28.86. So, this part right over here is approximately 28.86. That's our margin of error and we see out of all of these choices here if we round to the nearest 10th that would be 28.9, so this is approximately 28.9 which is this choice right over here. This was an awfully close one. I guess they're trying to make sure that we're looking at enough digits. So, there we have it. We have established our 95% confidence interval. Now, one thing that we should keep in mind is is this a valid confidence interval? Did we meet our conditions for a valid confidence interval? And here we have to think well, did we take a random sample and they tell us that they obtained a random sample of 14 burritos, so we check that one. Is the sampling distribution roughly normal? Well, if you take over 30 samples then it would be but here we only took 14 but they do tell us that the sample data is roughly symmetric and so, if it's roughly symmetric and it has no significant outliers, then this is reasonable that you can assume that it is roughly normal and then the last condition is the independence condition and here if we aren't sampling with replacement and it doesn't look like we are, if we're not sampling with replacement, this has to be less than 10% of the population of burritos and we're assuming that there's going to be more than 140 burritos that this popular restaurant makes. So, I think we can meet the independence condition as well, so assuming that you feel good about constructing a confidence interval, this is the one that you would actually construct.",math_ap-statistics_estimating-confidence-ap
"  Part C, find the particular solution-- W as a function of t-- to the differential equations, derivative of W with respect to t is equal to 1 over 25 times w minus 300, with initial condition, at time 0, W is equal to 1,400. And the units in this problem, it was 1,400 tons they told us. So it might seem strange to see a differential equations problem on an AP exam. You say, wait, this isn't fair. This isn't a differential equations class. And the thing to keep in mind is if, on an AP exam, you see differential equations, they're really asking you to solve a differential equation that can be solved using the skills that you would learn in an AP class. And the main class of differential equations that you could solve are the ones that are separable differential equations. The ones where you can separate the independent and the dependent variables. And if you don't have any idea what I'm talking about, I'm about to show you. So let me rewrite this differential equation. We have dw, dt is equal to 1 over 25 times W minus 300. Now this differential equation, we have W here. And we have this dt. But we don't have t anywhere else. So what I want to do is I want to get the parts that involve W onto the left-hand side, and I want to get anything that deals with dt on the right-hand side. So let's divide both sides of this equation by w minus 300. So we would have 1 over W minus 300 dw dt-- the derivative of W with respect to t-- is equal to-- I divide this side by W minus 300, so it's equal to 1 over 25. Now I want to get the dt's on this side. So let's multiply both sides by dt. [INAUDIBLE] the differential is just a very, very small change in t. And so we get-- and I'm a little bit imprecise with my notation here. But this is one way that you can think about it when you are dealing with the differential equations like this, separable differential equations. You have 1 over W minus 300 dw-- let me make sure that the dw doesn't look like it's in the denominator-- dw is equal to 1 over 25 dt. And now we can integrate both sides, which is essentially just saying that we're taking-- since this is equal to this-- that each little increment of W times this is equal to each little increment of dt times 1 over 25. We can then say, well, if we sum up all of the increments of W times this quantity-- if we sum up the infinite number of infinitesimally small increments-- that would be the same thing as summing up all of these characters. Because each of these characters is really the same as each of these characters. So let's do that sum. We're essentially just integrating both sides of this. And here, you might be able to do this in your head. Or we could do the formal u substitution, just to make it clear what we're doing. If you said u is equal to W minus 300, then what is du? If you wanted the differential. So if you want to take the derivative of u with respect to W, you would say du with respect to W is equal to what? It is equal to 1. The derivative of this with respect to W is 1. Or if you multiply both sides times dw, you have du is equal to dw. And so this left-hand side right over here-- this integral-- could be rewritten as the integral of 1 over u du. We define this as u. And we just saw that du is the same thing as dw, so this could be rewritten as du. And this is one of the basic integrals, so hopefully we've learned. And this is equal to the natural log of the absolute value of u. Or if you unwind the substitution, this is equal to the natural log of the absolute value of W minus 300. So let me write this down. So the left-hand side right over here. And you might be able do that in your head. You say, hey, look. You have W minus 300. Its derivative is 1, so it's essentially there. So I can just take this as if this was 1 over-- I could just take the antiderivative here and treat this whole thing as a variable. So it would just be the natural log of this entire thing, or the absolute value of that entire thing. So the integral of the left-hand side is the natural log of the absolute value of W minus 300. And the derivative of the right-hand side-- and this is a little bit more straightforward-- or sorry, the antiderivative with respect to t on the right-hand side is 1 over 25 t, or we could say t over 25.  And then these are both indefinite integrals. You could have a constant on both sides or one side. We could just put it on one side right over here. You could have put plus some constant. You could have added some C1 over here. And then you could've had C2 over here. But then you could've subtracted C1 from both sides, and then just have a C3 constant over here. But to simplify it, you could just say, look, this is going to be equal to this plus some constant. You could've put the constant on that side as well. It doesn't matter. All the constants would merge into one. Now we've gotten pretty far. We want to solve the particular solution. Right now, we only have this constant. And we also haven't written W as a function of t just right yet. They're implicitly expressed. It is more of a relationship than a function right now. So the first thing we can do is try to solve for C. We're told in the problem that W of 0 is equal to 1400 tons. They told us that. That's one of our initial conditions. So we know that the natural log, that when t is equal to 0, W is equal to 1400. So W is equal to 1,400 when t is equal to 0 plus C. Or another way to think about it is, the natural log of the absolute value of 1,100 is equal to C. And obviously, this is a positive value. So we could just say that C is equal to the natural log of 1,100. We can drop the absolute value sign because the absolute value of 1,100 is 1,100. So now we can rewrite this part right over here. Let me do it in yellow. Let me start-- that's not yellow. Let me start right over here. So we could write the natural log of the absolute value of W minus 300. And actually, we know that W is an increasing function. W starts at 1,400 and only goes up from there as t gets larger and larger. So if we're starting at 1,400 and only getting larger and larger values for W, this expression right here is never going to get negative for positive t values. And that's all we care about. And so we can actually drop the absolute value sign. This will always be a positive value. So we could say the absolute value of W minus 300 is equal to t over 25-- and we've just solved for our constant-- plus the natural log of 1,100. And now we can just solve this explicitly for W. We can raise e to both sides. This value is equal to this value. The left hand side is equal to the right hand side. So e raised to this power is the same thing as e raised to that power. So we have e to the natural log of W minus 300 is going to be equal to e to the t over 25 plus the natural log of 1,100. Let me take this-- actually, just to get the real estate, let me delete that. All right. Now I can keep working right below that. And so e to the natural log of something is just going to be equal to that something. The natural log is what power do I have to raise e to to get this thing. Well I'm raising e to that power, so I'm going to get this thing. So the left-hand side just becomes W minus 300, and the right-hand side, we could rewrite this as e to the t over 25 times e to the natural log of 1,100. We have the same base, different exponents. If you wanted to simplify this, you would just add the exponents, which is exactly what we did up here. So these two things are equivalent. e to the natural log of 1,100, that is 1,100. The natural log of 1,100 is a power that you raise e to to get to 1,100. So if you raise e to that power, you get 1,100. So that is 1,100. So we get W minus 300 is equal to 1,100 e to the t over 25. And then you just add 300 to both sides. W is equal to 1,100 e to the t over 25 plus 300. And we're done. We have solved the differential equation. We found the particular solution. We had to solve for C to find that particular solution. We're done. And we did it using just basic integration. We didn't have to use any of the fancy differential equation solving tools that you might learn in a more advanced class.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-solved-exams
" -  What we're going to do in this video is talk about the idea of a residual plot for a given regression and the data that it's trying to explain. So right over here, we have a fairly simple least squares regression. We're trying to fit four points. And in previous videos, we actually came up with the equation of this least squares regression line. What I'm going to do now is plot the residuals for each of these points. So what is a residual? Well, just as a reminder, your residual for a given point is equal to the actual minus the expected. So how do I make that tangible? Well, what's the residual for this point right over here? For this point here, the actual y when x equals one is one, but the expected, when x equals one for this least squares regression line, 2.5 times one minus two, well, that's gonna be .5. And so our residual is one minus .5, so we have a positive, we have a positive 0.5 residual. Over for this point, you have zero residual. The actual is the expected. For this point right over here, the actual, when x equals two, for y is two, but the expected is three. So our residual over here, once again, the actual is y equals two when x equals two. The expected, two times 2.5 minus two is three, so this is going to be two minus three, which equals a residual of negative one. And then over here, our residual are actual. When x equals three is six, our expected when x equals three is 5.5. So six minus 5.5, that is a positive 0.5. So those are the residuals, but how do we plot it? Well, we would set up or axes. Let me do it right over here. One, two, and three. And let's see, the maximum residual here is positive .5 and then the minium one here is negative one. So let's see, this could be .5, one. negative .5, negative one. So this is negative one. This is positive one here. And so when x equals one, what was the residual? Well, the actual was one, expected was 0.5, one minus 0.5 is 0.5. So this right over here, we can plot right over here. The residual is 0.5. When x equals two, we actually have two data points. First, I'll do this one. When we have the point two comma three, the residual there is zero. So for one of them, the residual is zero. Now for the other one, the residual is negative one. Let me do that in a different color. For the other one, the residual is negative one, so we would plot it right over here. And then this last point, the residual is positive .5. So it is just like that. And so this thing that I have just created, where we're just seeing, for each x where we have a corresponding point, we plot the point above or below the line based on the residual. This is called a residual plot. Now, one question is why do people even go through the trouble of creating a residual plot like this. The answer is, regardless of whether the regression line is upward sloping or downward sloping, this gives you a sense of how good a fit it is and whether a line is good at explaining the relationship between the variables. The general idea is if you see the point pretty evenly scattered or randomly scattered above and below this line, you don't really discern any trend here, then a line is probably a good model for the data. But if you do see some type of trend, if the residuals had an upward trend like this or if they were curving up and then curving down, or they had a downward trend, then you might say, ""Hey, this line isn't a good fit, ""and maybe we would have to do a non-linear model."" What are some examples of other residual plots? And let's try to analyze them a bit. So right here you have a regression line and its corresponding residual plot. And once again, you see here, the residual is slightly positive. The actual is slightly above the line, and you see it right over there, it's slightly positive. This one's even more positive, you see it there. But like the example we just looked at, it looks like these residuals are pretty evenly scattered above and below the line. There isn't any discernible trend. And so I would say that a linear model here, and in particular, this regression line, is a good model for this data. But if we see something like this, a different picture emerges. When I look at just the residual plot, it doesn't look like they're evenly scattered. It looks like there's some type of trend here. I'm going down here, but then I'm going back up. When you see something like this, where on the residual plot you're going below the x-axis and then above, then it might say, ""Hey, a linear model ""might not be appropriate. ""Maybe some type of non-linear model. ""Some type of non-linear curve ""might better fit the data,"" or the relationship between the y and the x is non-linear. Another way you could think about it is when you have a lot of residuals that are pretty far away from the x-axis in the residual plot, you'd also say, ""This line isn't such a good fit."" If you calculate the R value here, it would only be slightly positive, but it would not be close to one.",math_ap-statistics_bivariate-data-ap
" -  Let's see if we can figure out the surface area of this cereal box. And there's a couple of ways to tackle it. The first way is, well let's figure out the surface area of the sides that we can see, and then think about what the surface area of the sides that we can't see are and how they might relate, and then add them all together. So let's do that. So the front of the box is 20 centimeters tall and 10 centimeters wide. It's a rectangle, so to figure out its area we can just multiply 20 centimeters times 10 centimeters, and that's going to give us 200 centimeters. 200 centimeters, or 200 square centimeters, I should say. 200 square centimeters, that's the area of the front. And let me write it right over here as well, 200. Now we also know there's another side that has the exact same area as the front of the box, and that's the back of the box. And so let's write another 200 square centimeters for the back of the box. Now let's figure out the area of the top of the box. The top of the box, we see the box is three centimeters deep so this right over here is three centimeters. It's three centimeters deep and it's 10 centimeters wide. We see the box is 10 centimeters wide. So the top of the box is gonna be three centimeters times 10 centimeters, which is 30 square centimeters of area. So that's the top of the box, 30 square centimeters. Well, the bottom of the box is gonna have the exact same area, we just can't see it right now, so that's gonna be another 30. Then we have two more sides, cuz this box has six sides, We have this side panel that is 20 centimeters tall, we see that the height of the box is 20 centimeters and three centimeters deep. So three times 20, let me write that a little bit neater. Three times 20, that's 20 centimeters right there. Three centimeters times 20 centimeters is going to give us 60 square centimeters. Now that's this side panel, but there's another side panel that has the exact same area that's on the other side of the box, so it's 60 centimeters squared for this side, and then another 60 for the corresponding side opposite to it that we can't see. And now we can just add up all of these together. And so we get zero, this is going to be carry the one, or regroup the one, it's a 100, and then we have 500. So we get 580 square centimeters is the surface area of this box.",math_6th-grade-illustrative-math_unit-1-area-and-surface-area
" In this video, I want to introduce you to a mechanism called the aldol reaction. And it's easily one of the most important mechanisms and reactions in all of organic chemistry because it's a powerful way to actually create carbon-carbon bonds. And it'll actually be a little bit of a review of what we saw with enol and the enolate ions and the keto-enol tautomerism. I have trouble saying that. Anyway, let's start with a couple of aldehydes. And just for convenience I'll make them identical. So let's say that this is one of aldehydes, it just has a carbon chain there. That's what the r is, it could be of any length. Who knows what's there. And then I have another carbon here. And then this is bound to the carbonyl group and we're going to make it an aldehyde, although you could do this reaction with a ketone as well. And just to make things clear, this carbon right here-- which is going to be involved in a lot of the business here-- let me draw it's hydrogens. Normally we don't have to draw its hydrogens. And just as a bit of review, the carbon that is next to the carbonyl carbon is called an alpha carbon. If this was a ketone, this would have also been an alpha carbon if this was a carbon. And we're going to see in this reaction, besides just exploring the reaction, is that these hydrogens are actually much more acidic then traditional hydrogens attached to carbons on the rest of the chain. And it comes from the fact that this proton can be given to something else, the electron can go to that carbon, and then it'll be resoce stabilized. And we're going to see that in a second. Now I said I would draw two molecules of that, because we need two molecules. We're actually going to be, to some degree, joining the two molecules. So let me draw another aldehyde right over here. And I'm going to draw it symmetric to this, because it'll make it, I think, a little bit easier to visualize the two molecules. Actually, let me just draw it the same way. But I'll draw it in a different color. So you have the r group and then you have the oxygen right there. And I won't draw all of the hydrogens on this guy, but this and this are the exact same molecule. It's just the hydrogens are implicit here. Now, the aldol reaction I'll show you will be in a basic environment. So you could imagine that it'll be catalyzed by a base. And so, imagine we have some hydroxide laying around. Some of the hydroxide anion. Let me do that in a different color. So let's say we have some hydroxide anion floating around-- negative charge, just like that. I just told you that these hydrogens are much more acidic then hydrogens anywhere else on a carbon chain-- these alpha hydrogens. So you could imagine a situation where an electron from the hydroxide is given to one of these hydrogen protons and then the electron that was associated with that hydrogen is now given back to this alpha carbon. And so if that were to happen, the next step in our reaction would look like this. And I'll draw it in equilibrium. Actually, let me draw it this way. So the products of that step would be in equilibrium, with, you have your carbon chain or the rest of your molecule right there. And that's just to show that it could be anything. It's attached here to the alpha carbon, which is now going to be negative-- I'll show that in a second-- which is attached to the carbonyl group, which is attached to a hydrogen. And actually, I'll stop drawing that hydrogen for now, too. Just, we know it's there. But I'll keep drawing this hydrogen right over here. The other hydrogen was taken away and this alpha carbon now has a negative charge because it got the electron from that proton. And of course, we have the hydroxide. It grabbed this hydrogen and it is now water. Now the reason why this was acidic to begin with is because this is resoce stabilized. And I'll show you that it's resoce stabilized right now. This alpha carbon right here can give its electron to the carbonyl carbon. And if the carbonyl carbon gets an electron, it can give an electron to this oxygen up here. It'll break the double bond. So this configuration is resoce stabilized with this. So I could draw it like this. You have your r and then you have a single bond to this oxygen. It now gained an electron. It is now negative. And you now have a double bond, just like that. And I could draw this hydrogen if I like, or I don't have to. It's implicitly over there now. And you might be familiar with this. This is the Enolate anion. This right here is the enolate ion. If we had a hydrogen right here, it would be enol, and we would say hey, this is the keto form, this is the enol form. We've seen this before. Now, what's interesting about the enolate ion is it can act as a nucleophile. It can do a nucleophilic attack on the other aldehyde's carbonyl group. But it does it in kind of a non-conventional way. And I'll show you how it does it right now. So it does the attack like this. So let me draw this guy over here. So you have the carbonyl group and then you have its alpha carbon and then you have an r group right over there. There's actually a hydrogen right over here, as well. I just flipped it over. This and this are the same molecule. And let me make it clear-- these two guys right here are residence forms. And, once again, this is the reason why it's easier to take this hydrogen than other hydrogens on a traditional carbon chain. Easier to take an alpha hydrogen to a carbonyl group because you have this resoce structure. But this enolate ion, especially this configuration of it, you can imagine it doing something like this. You can imagine this oxygen giving back the electron to the carbonyl carbon-- to this carbon right here. And when that happens, then this guy is going to be giving up an electron. And that electron that he gives up-- let me do it in a new color-- this electron that he gives up could go and do a nucleophilic attack on this carbonyl group. And so if that carbonyl carbon gets-- let me do this in a new color-- if this carbonyl carbon gets an electron, then it could give away an electron to that oxygen right up there. So the next step after this, we would have something like this. And once again, I'll show it as happening in equilibrium. So from here we go right over there, and what we have is a situation-- let me draw this guy on the left first. So we have a double bond to this oxygen now. Actually, let me draw the second. So this is this oxygen. We now have a double bond. And let me do it in this same purple color right over here. And then we have the rest of what was an aldehyde. Where you have-- let me do it in that same color-- and then you have your r group right over there. But now this electron gets in an attack on this other aldehyde. So this guy right here, this alpha carbon is that same alpha carbon we've been dealing with, is now bonded to this carbonyl carbon. So it is now bound to this carbonyl carbon right over here. And so it will look like this. Let me draw it with the right colors. Get the orange out. So that carbonyl carbon, it now has a single bond to this oxygen. This electron was taken back by it. So this oxygen now has a negative charge. And it is bound to its alpha carbon. And then that is bonded to another group, probably a carbon chain or something that contains a carbon chain or another function or group. Whatever you want to call it. And then the final step. This anion can get rid of its negative charge by essentially grabbing a hydrogen maybe from this water that was formed before. Obviously, not going to be the same molecule, but it could grab it from this in a previous step. This water molecule that was formed in a previous step. And of course, this is all in a basic environment. So it can give an electron to this hydrogen, and then the hydrogen proton would lose an electron to the hydroxide and the hydroxide will become negative again. And so what will be the final product? The final product will be-- and I'm just going to try my best to redraw this thing right over here. You have this part of the molecule, so you have this carbonyl group right over here. It is attached to this radical group right over there. So that is this part. And I can even do the same colors. This bond right over here is this bond right over here. And then this carbon is attached to a carbon that's attached to a hydroxyl group now. So it'll look like this. And let me draw it. So this oxygen is now this oxygen, and it just captured this hydrogen. So it is now a hydroxyl group. It's now an -OH group. And then, finally, this guy is bound to what was an alpha carbon. It's not anymore. What was an alpha carbon, which is then bound to a radical group. And if we want, we can remember that there was always, from the get-go, there was always a 1hydrogen over here. 1So why is this called the aldol reaction 1and why does it matter? 1Well, it's called the aldol reaction because what we 1formed is both an aldehyde-- notice this is an aldehyde-- 1and it's an alcohol. 1So that's where the word aldol comes from. 1But the more important thing about this-- and I don't want 1to mislead you-- could have also done this with a ketone 1You could have had a methyl group or a ethyl group. 1You could have had a big carbon chain here. 1It still would've worked. 1So the aldol reaction doesn't only form things that are 1aldehydes and alcohols. 1It could have formed something that's both a 1ketone and an alcohol. 1But that's why it's called the aldol reaction. 1But the more important thing about the aldol reaction is, 1one, it shows you how the enolate ion can be a 1nucleophile. 1It shows you why the alpha hydrogens are more acidic than 1hydrogens on other parts of carbon chains. 1But the most useful aspect of it is it's a useful way to 1actually join two carbon chains together. 1Notice, we were able to join this alpha carbon right here 1to this carbonyl carbon over here to form this aldol. 1Or sometimes this will be called-- because this is still 1an alpha carbon right here, this is an alpha carbon, this 1is a beta carbon-- and so sometimes this will be 1referred to as a beta hydroxy. 1And we've probably used things from the pharmacy that has 1this word in it. 1This is also called a beta hydroxy. 1This is alpha, this is beta. 1It has a hydroxyl group on the beta carbon. 1Beta hydroxy aldehyde. 1Anyway, hopefully you found that entertaining.",science_organic-chemistry_ochem-alpha-carbon-chemistry
" -  So let's continue with our conversation around factors of production for a firm, and we're going to focus on the labor market. And so we've already drawn axes like this multiple times, where our horizontal axis, this is the quantity, quantity of labor that's being employed by a firm. And then the vertical axis, this is our wage rate. And so this is, we're looking at the economics for a firm. And we're looking at how much labor is it rational for this firm to employ? And we've talked about the marginal revenue product multiple times. This is a view of how much incremental revenue can the firm get every time it brings on one more labor unit? And we've talked about that we typically see it like a downward-sloping line like this 'cause you have diminishing returns. Every time you add one more labor unit, the marginal revenue product of that labor goes a little bit down, and so that's when you have diminishing returns. So this is marginal revenue products, and I'll be very particular this time. This is of labor. We could do a similar marginal revenue product of other factors like land or capital. Now, to change things up in this video, we're not just going to talk about a firm that operates in a perfectly competitive labor market. If we did, then its marginal factor cost would be whatever the market wage rate would be, and it would be a horizontal line like this. So you would have a marginal factor cost of labor. But we're not going to talk about a firm that's in a perfectly competitive labor market. We're going to talk about a firm that is a monopsony employer, a very fancy word. So it is a monopsony, not a monopoly, a monopsony. Now, what does a monopsony mean? Well, you could almost view it as the reverse of what a monopoly is. A monopoly is you have one seller, so one seller, and many buyers, so many, many buyers. So that is a monopoly, monopoly right over there. A monopsony is when you have one buyer, so one buyer, and many sellers. And so you have many, many sellers. So this right over here is a monopsony firm, monopsony. And in the context that we're talking about, we're talking about labor markets. So this one, instead of saying one buyer, you could say this is one buyer of labor. So you could say one employer, one employer. And the sellers of labors, well, a seller of labor, well, these are many potential, potential workers, potential workers. And there is many real-world examples that approach monopsony employers. Let's say we're in a small town, and there's only one hospital, so they're going to be the monopsony employers of healthcare workers, of, say, nurses. And so what's interesting about a monopsony employer is they're not just going to take whatever the wage rate is, they have to essentially, they have a supply curve for labor in that market. And so, for example, in this market, when wages are low, there's going to be a low supply of labor. Not many people are going to wanna work for that hospital. And then as wages go up, more and more and more people are going to want to work for that monopsony employer. And so this is our labor, labor supply curve. Now, I'm gonna ask you a question. I'm gonna tell you right now, it is a trick question. What is going to be the rational quantity for this firm to hire? Now, you might be tempted to say, well, it's just the same thing. We would just want to keep hiring as long as our marginal revenue product of labor is higher than the cost of labor. And that would be true if you could afford to pay everyone a different rate. If this first unit of labor, you can pay someone this much, and then everyone that you hire, you have to just pay them a little bit more. But that's not the way that it typically works. In the real world, you often think about having to, whatever the wage is, if we decide that this is the quantity of labor that we wanna bring on, you wouldn't pay this wage just to that incremental person, you would have to pay that wage to everyone. And so to think about what is the rational quantity of labor to bring on for this firm, we would need to think, we need to calculate or at least visualize what the marginal factor cost of labor here, which is going to be different than our labor supply curve. And to help us visualize that, let me set up a little table here. So I'm just gonna make up some numbers. So look, we're going to think about the quantity of labor, so let's just go zero, one, two, three, four. And then let's think about the price of labor. And so let's say when the quantity of labor is one, the price of labor is three. And then it goes up as we, if we wanna hire more people, well, the price of labor goes up to four, goes up to five, goes up to six, keeps going. And then what would be the total cost of labor? So total labor cost, well, you could figure that out. If you hire one unit at $3 per unit, one times three is three. Two units at $4 per unit, remember, you're going to have to pay everyone the same amount. So it's not like you can just pay this first person $3 and only the second person $4, in which case, this would be seven. But if you're going to hire two units, you have to pay everyone $4. So your total cost is eight here, two times four. Three time five, your total cost is 15. Your total cost here is 24. And so now we could think about what is our marginal factor cost of labor? So when you bring on that incremental unit of labor, how much incremental cost are you taking on? Well, when you go from one to two units, your total cost goes from three to eight, so your marginal factor cost is five. This is plus five right over here. When you go from two to three, your marginal factor cost, you went from eight to 15. So eight to 15, you went up by seven. And once again, this is because when you wanna hire more people, you're going to have to pay more to track those incremental people, but then you have to pay that higher rate to everyone. And so you see that the marginal factor cost of labor is going up twice as fast as our labor supply curve. Our labor supply curve, every incremental unit, we're adding one. Here, every incremental unit, we're adding two. And we could see it again. To go from 15 to 24, you have to add nine, so our marginal factor cost of labor is nine. And so looking at this as an example, you see that your marginal factor cost of labor is going to go up at twice the slope of your labor supply curve. So your marginal factor cost of labor is going to look something like this. It's going to go up twice as fast, marginal factor cost of labor. And now this might be ringing a bell. This might seem like what we studied in the past when we looked at a monopoly or an imperfect competitor firm. And we talked about the demand for its goods, and we also talked about its marginal revenue. And the marginal revenue curve had twice the negative slope as the demand curve. And here, we see everything just flipped over. Because we're now not talking about revenue for the firm and marginal revenue for the firm, we are talking about costs for the firm. These are inputs for the firm. But now what would be the rational wage rate? And what's the rational quantity of labor for this firm? Well, now that we've done the marginal analysis, we would see that it's rational for the firm to keep bringing on more and more people as long as the marginal revenue product of labor for each incremental unit is higher than the marginal factor cost of labor for each incremental unit. And so we'd keep hiring until you get to this point right over here. So it would be rational for it to bring on this quantity of labor. And what would be the wage that it would pay? Well, you might be tempted to just go right over here and say it would pay this wage, but remember it doesn't have to pay this wage. At this quantity of labor, the labor supply curve tells us that the market wage would be right over here. So it would be paying, it would be paying this wage. It would be paying this wage right over here. So this is something for you to maybe ponder on a little bit more. But the big picture is, is when we're dealing with a monopsony firm, so it is the only person hiring in the market or something that's approaching a monopsony firm, it's going to have its own labor supply curve. And the way you think about what a rational quantity for it to hire is, you would think about the marginal factor cost of labor, which is going to go up at twice the slope. And where that intersects the marginal revenue product, well, that tells you the quantity, and then the labor supply curve will tell you the wage for that quantity.",economics-finance-domain_ap-microeconomics_factor-markets
" -  I wanna talk a little bit about carbon and how it cycles through our biosphere. And we touch on this in other videos. But when we talk about elements like carbon, they don't just appear and disappear all of a sudden in our biosphere. For the most part, they have been here since the beginning. But they just get recycled from one form to another. And that is also true of carbon. And to appreciate carbon's importance in our biosphere, and especially to life, I have some, some important molecules, or examples of important molecules that involve carbon. In all of these, the carbons are these dark gray colors. So this right over here, this molecule, this is glucose. Glucose, simple sugar. It's where we can derive a lot of our energy from. This is ATP, you can view it as a more immediate store of energy in biological systems. This right over here is one of many amino acids. The amino acids make up our proteins. This right over here is DNA. And in all of these you can see the role that carbon is playing. In fact, sometimes the carbon's hard to see because it's closer to the center of these molecules because the carbon, for the most part, forms the backbone. Because carbon's this really neat, this really neat element, this really neat atom that can make four bonds. It can make these really really really cool structures. But the question is how does carbon cycle through our biosphere? And we can get as simple or as complex as we want to when we discuss this. But on very very simple terms, this is how my brain tends to think about the carbon cycle. You can imagine the carbon in our atmosphere that's mainly in the form of molecular carbon dioxide. So this right over here, this is CO two. Once again, the carbon is in the middle there, bonded to the two oxygens. And as much as we talk about CO two, and as important as carbon is to living systems. In fact, our bodies are 18 to 19 percent carbon carbon by mass. So it's very important for biological systems. As important as carbon is to biological systems, and the role carbon dioxide plays in things like global warming, it actually makes up a very small percentage of our atmosphere. It's only about 0.04 percent of the gas in our atmosphere. Most of our atmosphere is actually nitrogen, 78 percent, you don't talk a lot about it. And oxygen, 21 percent. And then a bunch of other, a bunch of other elements and molecules. But the very simple version of the carbon cycle is, okay, you have this atmospheric carbon dioxide, molecular carbon dioxide, hanging out in the air. And you have autotrophs like plants. So let's say this is the ground, and I have a growing plant. So that's a plant right over there. That's its leaf, that's another leaf. And the way that plants grow is they're able to take light energy. So that's energy coming in from the sun, and use that energy to fix carbon. Now fixing carbon sounds like a very fancy thing, but it's literally taking that molecular carbon dioxide out of the air and fixing the carbon from it to form these different molecules in the plant, that help the plant, that give the plant structure, that give the plant energy. And so that mass of that plant, I'm actually in this room I'm in, there's a houseplant right next to me, it's not just growing out of, I mean, I guess you could say it's growing out of thin air, but the mass isn't just magically appearing. It's taking that mass out of the air. And so that's where, so that's what allows this plant to keep growing. And so, once again, as I said, some of that will be in the form of proteins, amino acids, it could form structural components. It could be fats, and also some of it is energy. And you could imagine other animals that can't do this, that can't photosynthesize, well, they might wanna eat these plants for that energy. In other videos, we talk about the food cycle. And so, this could be me. This could be me having a salad, and I might want to eat that plant. I might wanna eat the plant for the sugar in it. Maybe it's an apple of some kind, and then that gives my body the energy to live and grow. And as I, as I metabolize that glucose, so for example glucose is one of the molecules that that plant can form by taking that carbon out of the air. And then I might metabolize that glucose from that plant I just ate, and as I do that, I will release carbon dioxide. So I will release the CO two back in the air. And then you can see that you can form a cycle here. The CO two gets released by things that are metabolizing these organic molecules, and then it can get fixed again by autotrophs, which are able to store the energy from the sun with, in terms of these bonds, by fixing this carbon. But there's other pathways that we can have to have these cycles. For example, some of the CO two, it could be absorbed into the ocean. It could be absorbed into, into the ocean. And in the ocean it can form carbonate, and so once again you still see the carbon right over there, carbon bonded to three oxygens, and calcium carbonate is a key constituent in things like seashells. And over time, as the sea shells break down, and they get ground up, and they get impacted with pressure, they can form, they can form limestone. So this right over here is limestone. Limestone. But once again, it was formed from carbon dioxide being absorbed into the ocean, living things using that calcium, using that calcium carbonate, the carbonate in conjunction with calcium, in order to form these shells, which get ground down, and it actually forms these rock structures. You can have situations, you can have situations where living things, whether we're talking about the autotrophs like plants, or we're talking about things like me that are eating the plants, well, once they die and there's all this organic matter that hasn't been broken down yet. Well, it gets buried in the ground. I'll do the plant because it's less morbid than showing me dead. So let's say this is the plant. Well, with enough pressure and time. Sometimes in the decomposing process, some of the carbon might be released. But over time this might be compressed and be turned into fossil fuels. So when you see oil or when you are burning gasoline, which is really just a refined part of the oil, it is really this organic matter that was, that's storing energy that plants were able to store from light energy, possibly millions or tens of millions of years ago. But then if you were to take that same, if you were to take that fossil fuel out of the ground, which we now do very actively in order to power all of the things that we need to power, and you were to burn it. So let me see, if I were to. Let me just draw an example of that. So let's say you just had, if you had a canister of oil. I'm not gonna do the oil in black because you'd have trouble seeing it. And if you were to burn it. If you were to burn it, the process of, the process of combustion. And this is in general, if you're burning anything, it doesn't just have to be oil. It could be burning a piece of wood. You're taking that organic matter, those carbon-carbon bonds, and in some ways you can say you're doing the reverse of the photosynthesis process. You're breaking it down, and in that process, you're releasing that carbon, and it's getting released in the form of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide, which in theory could then be fixed once again. So the general idea, autotrophs like plants, when they photosynthesize, they can fix that carbon. And then it could either be burnt, and a combustion process can release that carbon back into the atmosphere, or you could have other animals eating that plant. And then, as they metabolize, as they break these carbon-carbon bonds to power themselves or just do whatever they need to do, that also can release carbon dioxide.",science_biology_ecology
" -  In this video, we're gonna build on what we already know about aggregate demand and aggregate supply, and the Phillips curve, and we are going to connect these ideas. So first, the Phillips curve. This is a typical Phillips curve for an economy. High inflation is associated with low unemployment, high unemployment is associated with low inflation, but we can really view this curve as the short run Phillips curve. Short run Phillips curve. We might sit at different points on this curve at different points in an economic cycle, but we could also introduce an idea known as a long run Phillips curve, which is just based on the natural rate of unemployment for this economy. So let's say the natural rate of unemployment for this economy is 6%. So, then our long run Phillips curve would just be a vertical line right over there. Long run Phillips curve. Now why is it a vertical line? Well it says in the long run, our natural rate of unemployment is 6% regardless of what the inflation rate might be. And so if we are sitting at the intersection of these two curves, that means that our economy right in this moment in time is operating at full employment. If unemployment was lower than that, it would be overheating to some degree, and if unemployment were higher than that, then we would have a negative output gap. But how do we tie these ideas to aggregate demand and aggregate supply? Well let's draw our long run aggregate supply curve, and I'm gonna do it right at the intersection of our aggregate demand and short run aggregate supply curve for now, because I wanna show an economy that's operating at its full potential. So here, this is our long run aggregate supply, and once again it's a vertical line because in the long run, regardless of the price level, we have a certain output for this economy that is sustainable. So that is our full employment. I'll do F, period, E, period. That's our full employment output. Anything more than that, it's unsustainable based on where the economy is structurally right now, and anything less than that, is you have a negative output gap. But now let's think about what would happen if we start shifting curves around. What if we were to have a negative demand shock? So our aggregate demand curve shifts to the left. Well in that world, and this is all a review, you can see that your equilibrium price, so I'm gonna call this aggregate demand sub two, our price level two, and our new equilibrium output for our economy sub two. You can see that both are lower. We now have a negative output gap. But what would that correspond to here on our Phillips curves? Well, when you have a negative output gap, you're likely to have higher unemployment. And shifts in aggregate in the aggregate demand curve would be movements along the short run Phillips curve. So we're gonna move along the short run Phillips curve, and we're going to have higher unemployment, 'cause we have a negative output gap. So we might get to that point right over there. So I'll just call that point sub two. So we went from a situation where before, we had 6% unemployment, and let's say we had 3% inflation, to a world where maybe now, we have, I don't know, let's call it 9% unemployment, and now we have 2% inflation. And it could go the other way around. Let's say we were starting from our original aggregate demand curve and you have a positive demand shock, and so now you could go to this curve, aggregate demand three, and so here, our equilibrium price level is higher. It's called P sub three. And our equilibrium output, we have a positive output gap, so Y sub three. And that would correspond to, if we have a positive output gap, that means we have very low unemployment, maybe unsustainably low unemployment. So we might be right over here. So this might be a situation where our unemployment rate, let's say that's about, I don't know, 4%. And now our inflation, this might be, let's call that 4% as well. And something interesting happens as you start to have higher and higher inflation. That can lead to people just having higher expectations for price and higher expectations for inflation itself. And if folks have higher expectations for inflation, well then they might wanna charge more for a certain level of output. So let's say at this level of output, people might want to have a higher price level. At this level of output, people might wanna have a higher level price, a higher price level. And so it could actually shift our short run aggregate supply up, or you could say to the left. So short run aggregate supply, I'll call that sub three. Now when the short run aggregate supply gets shifted to the left in this situation, notice we're back to our full employment output, but our price level is now much higher. Now what would that correspond to over here? Well when you have a shift in short run aggregate supply curves, that would actually lead to a shift in your short run Phillips curve, but which way would it shift? Well another way to think about it is, at a given, just as at a given level of output you would've expected a higher price because of this increased inflation expectations, so here, at a given level of unemployment, you would expect a higher level of inflation. So, our curve, you would say shifts up or to the right. So we would then have a short run Phillips curve that looks like this. I'll call that sub three. And we might get back to this point. Well for sure if were at this full employment output, then we are operating in our natural rate of unemployment again, but notice, now our inflation has crept even higher. This might be 5% inflation. Now the last thing you might be wondering about is when do these long run curves ever shift? Well we've talked about it before when we talked about long run aggregate supply, and that shifts if the economy structurally changes somehow. Let's say our factories get bombed out in a war or something, then this should shift to the left. And if we got better technology, or better ways of organizing ourselves, or more resources, this might shift to the right. Similarly, if there's a massive shift in global trade, and maybe our workers' skills aren't as valuable anymore in the global economy, this long run Phillips curve might shift to the right. If all of a sudden we are able to, or over time, we're able to get people more skilled, maybe we get frictional unemployment down because we have better technology to place people, well that might shift this to the left.",economics-finance-domain_macroeconomics_macro-long-run-consequences-of-stabilization-policies
" -  Which slope field is generated by the differential equation the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to x minus y? And like always pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. Well the easiest way to think about a slope field, if I was, if i needed to plot this slope field by hand, I would sample a bunch of x and y points. And then I would figure out what the derivative would have to be at that point. And so what we can do here, since we've already drawn some candidate slope fields for us, is figure out what we think the slope field should be at some points and see which of these diagrams, these graphs, or these slope fields actually show that. So let's, let me make a little table here, so I'm gonna have, x, y and then the derivative of y with respect to x. And we can do it at a bunch of values, so let's think about it. Let's think about when, we're at this point right over here. When x is two and y is two. When x is two and y is two, the derivative of y with respect to x is going to be two minus two. It's going to be equal to zero. And just with that, let's see, here this slope on this slope field does not look like it's zero. This looks like it's negative one. So already I can rule this one out. This slope right over looks like it's positive one. So I'll rule that out, it's definitely not zero. This slope also looks like positive one. So I can rule that one out. This slope at two comma two actually does look like zero. So I'm liking this one right over here. This slope at two comma two looks larger than one so I can rule that out. So it was that straight forward to deduce that this choice right over here is, if any of these are going to be the accurate slope field, it's this one. But just for kicks we could keep going to verify that this is indeed the slope field. So let's think about what happens when x is equal to a one, whenever x is equal to y, you're gonna get the derivative equaling zero. And you see that here, when you're at four, four, derivative equals zero. When it's six, six, derivative equals zero. At negative two, negative two, derivative equals zero. So that feels good, that this is the right slope field. And then we could pick other arbitrary points. Let's say when x is four, y is two, then the derivative here should be four minus two, which is going to be two. So when x is four, y is two, we do indeed see that the slope field is indicating a slope that looks like two right over here. And if it was the other way around, when x is let's say, x is negative four and y is negative two. The negative four, negative two. Well negative four minus negative two is going to be negative two. And you can see that right over here. Negative four, negative two, you can see the slope right over here. It's a little harder to see, looks like negative two. So once again using even just this first two comma two coordinates we were able to deduce this was the choice. But it just continues to confirm our original answer.",math_calculus-2_cs2-differential-equations
" Let's say I'm trying to judge how many years of experience we have at the Khan Academy. Or on average, how many years of experience we have. And in particular, the particular type of average we'll focus on, is the arithmetic mean. So I go and I survey the folks there. And let's say this was when Khan Academy was a smaller organization, when there were only five people in the organization. And I find-- and I'm surveying the entire population-- so years of experience, the entire population of Khan Academy, because that's what I care about, years of experience at our organization, at Khan Academy. And this was when we had five people. And I were to go-- we're now 36 people, I don't want to date this video too much-- but let's say I go, and I say, OK, there's one person straight out of college, they have one year of experience, or recently out of college, somebody with three years of experience, someone with five years of experience, someone with seven years of experience, and someone very experienced, or reasonably experienced, with 14 years of experience. So based on this data point, and this is our population, for years of experience. I'm assuming that we only have five people in the organization, at this point. What would be the population mean for the years of experience? What is the mean years of experience for my population? Well, we can just calculate that. Our mean experience, and I'm going to denote it with mu, because we're talking about the population now. This is a parameter for the population. It's going to be equal to the sum, from our first data point, so data point one all the way to data point, in this case, data point five-- we have five data points-- of each of-- so we're going to take all, from the first data point, the second data point, the third data point, all the way to the fifth. So this is going to be equal to x1, plus x-- and I'm going to divide it all by the number of data points I have-- plus x2, plus x3, plus x4, plus x sub 5, subscript 5. All of that over 5. And as we said, this is a very fancy way of saying, I'm going to sum up all of these things and then divide by the number of things we have. So let's do that. Get the calculator out. So I'm going to add them all up, 1 plus 3 plus 5-- I really don't need a calculator for this-- plus 7 plus 14. So that's five data points. And I'm going to divide by 5. And I get 6. So the population mean, for years of experience at my organization, is 6. 6 years of experience. Well, that's, I guess, interesting. But now I want to ask another question. I want to get some measure of how much spread there is around that mean. Or how much do the data points vary around that mean. And obviously, I can give someone all the data points. But instead, I actually want to come up with a parameter that somehow represents how much all of these things, on average, are varying from this number right here. Or maybe I will call that thing the variance. And so, what I do-- so the variance-- and I will do-- and this is a population variance that I'm talking about, just to be clear, it's a parameter. The population variance I'm going to denote with the Greek letter sigma, lowercase sigma-- this is capital sigma-- lowercase sigma squared. And I'm going to say, well, I'm going to take the distance from each of these points to the mean. And just so I get a positive value, I'm going to square it. And then, I'm going to divide by the number of data points that I have. So essentially, I'm going to find the average squared distance. Now that might sound very complicated, but let's actually work it out. So I'll take my first data point and I will subtract our mean from it. So this is going to give me a negative number. But if I square it, it's going to be positive. So it's, essentially, going to be the squared distance between 1 and my mean. And then, to that, I'm going to add the squared distance between 3 and my mean. And to that, I'm going to add the squared distance between 5 and my mean. And since I'm squaring, it doesn't matter if I do 5 minus 6, or 6 minus 5. When I square it, I'm going to get a positive result regardless. And then, to that I'm going to add the squared distance between 7 and my mean. So 7 minus 6 squared. All of this, this is my population mean that I'm finding the difference between. And then, finally, the squared difference between 14 and my mean. And then, I'm going to find, essentially, the mean of these squared distances. So I have five squared distances right over here. So let me divide by 5. So what will I get when I make this calculation, right over here? Well, let's figure this out. This is going to be equal to 1 minus 6 is negative 5, negative 5 squared is 25. 3 minus 6 is negative 3, now if I square that, I get 9. 5 minus 6 is negative 1, if I square it, I get positive 1. 7 minus 6 is 1, if I square it, I get positive 1. And 14 minus 6 is 8, if I square it, I get 64. And then, I'm going to divide all of that by 5. And I don't need to use a calculator, but I tend to make a lot of careless mistakes when I do things while making a video. So I get 25 plus 9 plus 1 plus 1 plus 64 divided by 5. So I get 20. So the average squared distance, or the mean squared distance, from our population mean is equal to 20. You may say, wait, these things aren't 20 away. Remember, it's the squared distance away from my population mean. So I squared each of these things. I liked it, because it made it positive. And we'll see later it has other nice properties about it. Now the last thing is, how can we represent this mathematically? We already saw that we know how to represent a population mean, and a sample mean, mathematically like this, and hopefully, we don't find it that daunting anymore. But how would we do the exact same thing? How would we denote what we did, right over here? Well, let's just think it through. We're just saying that the population variance, we're taking the sum of each-- so we're going to take each item, we'll start with the first item. And we're going to go to the n-th item in our population. We're talking about a population here. And we're going to take-- we're not going to just take the item, this would just be the item-- but we're going take the item. And from that, we're going to subtract the population mean. We're going to subtract this thing. We're going to subtract this thing. We're going to square it. We're going to square it. So the way I've written it right now, this would just be the numerator. I've just taken the sum of each of these things, the sum of the difference between each data point and the population mean and squared it. If I really want to get the way I figure out this variance right over here, I have to divide the whole thing by the number of data points we have. So this might seem very daunting, and very intimidating. But all it says is, take each of your data points-- well, one, it says, figure out your population mean. Figure that out first. And then, from each data point, in your population, subtract out that population mean, square it, take the sum of all of those things, and then just divide by the number of data points you have. And you will get your population variance.",math_statistics-probability_summarizing-quantitative-data
" Let's explore what it means to subtract numbers. So let's say that I want to figure out what 4, what 4 minus 3 is. 4 minus 3. So one way to think about this, is you start with 4 objects. And so let me just draw 4 objects. So there I have 1, 2, 3, and 4. And when I ... So this is the 4 objects right over here. And when I say minus 3, or if I'm going to subtract 3 from the 4, one way to think about it is, I'm going to take 3 of these 4 objects away. So let's do that. So I'm going to take away 1, I'm going to take away 2, and I'm going to take away 3. Notice, I took away 1, 2, 3 objects. So how many do I have leftover? Well, if I start with 4 and I take away 3, I subtract 3, 4 minus 3, I am left with, I am left with, 1 object, right over here. So 4 minus 3 is equal to, is equal to 1. Fascinating. Let's do another one of these. Let's figure out what 5, what 5, what 5 minus 2 is. And let's write it this way. Let's say we want to figure out something, some question mark, some question mark ... Actually, let me just clear this out. I'll just do it right over here, actually. So let's say we have some question mark. So there's some unknown number right over here. So I'll just put a question mark over here. And we say that unknown number is equal to, is equal to 5, 5 minus 2. Minus 2. Minus 2. So what is this going to be? Well let's visualize it. This means I have 5 things and I'm going to take away 2 of them and this is going to be what I have leftover after I start with 5 and take away 2. So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 things. Now I am going to take away 2 of them. So I'm going to take away 1 and 2. So I took away 1, 2 objects. So how many do I have leftover? Well, I have leftover these, these ... Let me do this in a different color. I have leftover these purple things right over here. So how many is that? How many do I have leftover? Well, I have leftover 1, 2, 3 of my original 5. So something is equal is 5 minus 2. That something is 3. 3 is equal to 5 minus 2. Let me just replace this with a 3. So we see that 3 ... Actually, let me do the 3 in the same color as this green. So we see that 3, 3 is equal to 5 minus 2 or we could say that 5 minus 2 is equal to 3. Either way.",math_cc-kindergarten-math_cc-kindergarten-add-subtract
" Now that we know a little bit about multiplying positive and negative numbers, Let's think about how how we can divide them. Now what you'll see is that it's actually a very similar methodology. That if both are positive, you'll get a positive answer. If one is negative, or the other, but not both, you'll get a negative answer. And if both are negative, they'll cancel out and you'll get a positive answer. But let's apply and I encourage you to pause this video and try these out yourself and then see if you get the same answer that I'm going to get. So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2). So if I just said eight (8) divided by two (2), that would be a positive four (4), but since exactly one of these two numbers are negative, this one right over here, the answer is going to be negative. So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2) is negative four (-4). Now negative sixteen (-16) divided by positive four (4)-- now be very careful here. If I just said positive sixteen (16) divided by positive four (4), that would just be four (4). But because one of these two numbers is negative, and exactly one of these two numbers is negative, then I'm going to get a negative answer. Now I have negative thirty (-30) divided by negative five (-5). If I just said thirty (30) divided by five (5), I'd get a positive six (6). And because I have a negative divided by a negative, the negatives cancel out, so my answer will still be positive six (6)! And I could even write a positive (+) out there, I don't have to, but this is a positive six (6). A negative divided by a negative, just like a negative times a negative, you're gonna get a positive answer. Eighteen (18) divided by two (2)! And this is a little bit of a trick question. This is what you knew how to do before we even talked about negative numbers: This is a positive divided by a positive. Which is going to be a positive. So that is going to be equal to positive nine (9). Now we start doing some interesting things, here's kind of a compound problem. We have some multiplication and some division going on. And so first right over here, the way this is written, we're gonna wanna multiply the numerator out, and if you're not familiar with this little dot symbol, it's just another way of writing multiplication. I could've written this little ""x"" thing over here but what you're gonna see in Algebra is that the dot become much more common. Because the X becomes used for other-- People don't want to confuse it with the letter X which gets used a lot in Algebra. That's why they used the dot very often. So this just says negative seven (-7) times three (3) in the numerator, and we're gonna take that product and divide it by negative one (-1). So the numerator, negative seven (-7) times three (3), positive seven (7) times three (3) would be twenty-one (21), but since exactly one of these two are negative, this is going to be negative twenty-one (-21), that's gonna be negative twenty-one (-21) over negative one (-1). And so negative twenty-one (-21) divided by negative one (-1), negative divided by a negative is going to be a positive. So this is going to be a positive twenty-one (21). Let me write all these things down. So if I were to take a positive divided by a negative, that's going to be a negative. If I had a negative divided by a positive, that's also going to be a negative. If I have a negative divided by a negative, that's going to give me a positive, and if obviously a positive divided by a positive, that's also going to give me a positive. Now let's do this last one over here. This is actually all multiplication, but it's interesting, because we're multiplying three (3) things, which we haven't done yet. And we could just go from left to right over here, and we could first think about negative two (-2) times negative seven (-7). Negative two (-2) times negative seven (-7). They are both negatives, and negatives cancel out, so this would give us, this part right over here, will give us positive fourteen (14). And so we're going to multiply positive fourteen (14) times this negative one (-1), times -1. Now we have a positive times a negative. Exactly one of them is negative, so this is going to be negative answer, it's gonna give me negative fourteen (-14). Now let me give you a couple of more, I guess we could call these trick problems. What would happen if I had zero (0) divided by negative five (-5). Well this is zero negative fifths So zero divided by anything that's non-zero is just going to equal to zero. But what if it were the other way around? What happens if we said negative five divided by zero? Well, we don't know what happens when you divide things by zero. We haven't defined that. There's arguments for multiple ways to conceptualize this, so we traditionally do say that this is undefined. We haven't defined what happens when something is divided by zero. And similarly, even when we had zero divided by zero, this is still, this is still, undefined.",math_in-in-class-7-math-kv_in-in-7-kv-integers
" In the last video, we attempted to approximate the area under a curve by constructing four rectangles of equal width and using the left boundary of each rectangle, the function evaluated at the left boundary, to determine the height, and we came up with an approximation. What I want to do in this video is generalize things a bit using the exact same method, but doing it for an arbitrary function with arbitrary boundaries and an arbitrary number of rectangles. So let's do it. So I'm going to draw the diagram as large as I can to make things as clear as possible. So that's my y-axis. And this right over here is my x-axis. Let me draw an arbitrary function. So let's say my function looks something like that. So that is y is equal to f of x. And let me define my boundaries. So let's say this right over here is x equals a. And this right over here is x equals b. So this is b. And I'm going to use n rectangles, and I'm going to use the function evaluated at the left boundary of the rectangle to determine its height. So, for example, this will be rectangle one. I'm going to evaluate what f of a is. So this right over here is f of a. And then I'm going to use that as the height of my first rectangle. So just like that. So rectangle number one looks like this. And I'll even number it. Rectangle one looks just like that. And just to have a convention here, because I'm going to want to label each of the x values at the left boundary, so we'll say a is equal to x0. a is equal to x0. So we could also call this point right over here x0, that x value. And then we go to the next rectangle. And we could call this one right over here, this x value, we'll call it x1. It's the left boundary of the next rectangle. If we evaluate f of x1, we get this value right over here. This right over here is f of x1, so it tells us our height. And we want an equal width to the previous one. We'll think about what the width is going to be in a second. So this right over here is our second rectangle that we're going to use to approximate the area under the curve. That's rectangle number two. Let's do rectangle number three. Well, rectangle number three, the left boundary, we're just going to call that x sub 2. And its height is going to be f of x sub 2. And its width is going to be the same width as the other ones. I'm just eyeballing it right over here. So this is rectangle number three. And we're going to continue this process all the way until we get to rectangle number n. So this is the n-th rectangle right over here, the n-th rectangle. And what am I going to label this point right over here? Well, we already see a pattern. The left boundary of the first rectangle is x sub 0. The left boundary of the second rectangle is x sub 1. The left boundary of the third rectangle is x sub 2. So the left boundary of the n-th rectangle is going to be x sub n minus 1. Whatever the rectangle number is, the left boundary is x sub that number minus 1. And this is just based on the convention that we've defined. Now, the next thing that we need to do in order to actually calculate this area is think about what is the width? So let's call the width of any of these rectangles-- and for these purposes, or the purpose of this example, I'm going to assume that it's constant, although you can do these sums where you actually vary the width of the rectangle. But then it gets a little bit fancier. So I want it equal width. So I want delta x to be equal width. And to think about what that has to be, we just have to think, what's the total width that we're covering? Well, the total distance here is going to be b minus a, and we're just going to divide by the number of rectangles that we want, the number of sections that we want. So we want to divide by n. So if we assume this is true, and then we assume that a is equal to x0, and then x1 is equal to x0 plus delta x, x2 is equal to x1 plus delta x, and we go all the way to xn is equal to xn minus 1 plus delta x, then we've essentially set up this diagram right over here. b is actually going to be equal xn. So this is xn. It's equal to xn minus 1 plus delta x. So now I think we've set up all of the notation and all the conventions in order to actually calculate the area, or our approximation of the area. So our approximation, approximate area, is going to be equal to what? Well, it's going to be the area of the first rectangle-- so let me write this down. So it's going to be rectangle one-- so the area of rectangle one-- so rectangle one plus the area of rectangle two plus the area of rectangle three-- I think you get the point here-- plus all the way to the area of rectangle n. And so what are these going to be? Rectangle one is going to be its height, which is f of x0 or f of a. Either way. x0 and a are the same thing. So it's f of a times our delta x, times our width, our height times our width. So times delta-- actually I can write as f of x0, I wanted to write-- f of x0 times delta x. What is our height of rectangle two? It's f of x1 times delta x. What's our area of rectangle three? It's f of x2 times delta x. And then we go all the way to our area. We're taking all the sums, all the way to rectangle n. What's its area? It's f of x sub n minus 1. Actually, that's a different shade of orange. I'll use that same shade. It is f of x sub n minus 1 times delta x. And we're done. We've written it in a very general way. But to really make us comfortable with the various forms of notation, especially the types of notation you might see when people are talking about approximating the areas or sums in general, I'm going to use the traditional sigma notation. So another way we could write this, as the sum, this is equal to the sum from-- and remember, this is just based on the conventions that I set up. I'll let i count which rectangle we're in, from i equals 1 to n. And then we're going to look at each rectangle. So the first rectangle, that's rectangle one. So it's going to be f of-- well, if we're in the i-th rectangle, then the left boundary is going to be x sub i minus 1 times delta x. And so here, right over here, is a general way of thinking about approximating the area under a curve using rectangles, where the height of the rectangles are defined by the left boundary. And this tells us it's the left boundary. And we see for each, if this is the i-th rectangle right over here, if this is rectangle i, then this right over here is x sub i minus 1, and this height right over here is f of x sub i minus 1. So that's all we did right over there times delta x. And then you sum of these from the first rectangle all the way to the end. So hopefully that makes you a little bit more comfortable with this notation. We're not doing anything different than we did in this first video, which was hopefully fairly straightforward for you. We have just generalized it using a little bit more mathy notation.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-integration-new
" You may by now be familiar with the notion of evaluating a function with a particular value, so for example, if this table is our function definition, if someone were to say, ""Well, what is f of -9?"" you could say, okay, if we input -9 into our function, if x is -9, this table tell us that f of x is going to be equal to 5. You might already have experience with doing composite functions, where you say, f of f of -9 plus 1. So this is interesting, it seems very daunting, but you say, well we know what f of -9 is, this is going to be 5, so it's going to be f of 5 plus 1. So this is going to be equal to f of 6, and if we look at our table, f of 6 is equal to -7. So all of that is review so far, but what I want to now do is start evaluating the inverse of functions. This function f is invertable, because it's a one-to-one mapping between the xs and the f of xs. No two xs map to the same f of x, so this is an invertable function. With that in mind, let's see if we can evaluate something like f inverse of 8. What is that going to be? I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about it. So f of x, just as a reminder of what functions do, f of x is going to map from this domain, from a value in its domain to a corresponding value in the range. So this is what f does, this is domain... and this right over here is the range. Now f inverse, if you pass it, the value and the range, it'll map it back to the corresponding value in the domain. But how do we think about it like this? Well, f inverse of 8, this is whatever maps to 8, so if this was 8, we'd have to say, well, what mapped to 8? We see here f of 9 is 8, so f inverse of 8 is going to be equal to 9. If it makes it easier, we could construct a table, where I could say x and f inverse of x, and what I'd do is swap these two columns. f of x goes from -9 to 5, f inverse of x goes from 5 to -9. All I did was swap these two. Now we're mapping from this to that. So f inverse of x is going to map from 7 to -7. Notice, instead of mapping from this thing to that thing, we're now going to map from that thing to this thing. So f inverse is going to map from 13 to 5. It's going to map from -7 to 6. It's going to map from 8 to 9, and it's going to map from 12 to 11. Looks like I got all of them, yep. So all I did was swap these columns. The f inverse maps from this column to that column. So I just swapped them out. Now it becomes a little clearer. You see it right here, f inverse of 8, if you input 8 into f inverse, you get 9. Now we can use that to start doing fancier things. We can evaluate something like f of f inverse of 7. f of f inverse of 7. What is this going to be? Let's first evaluate f inverse of 7. f inverse of 7 maps from 7 to -7. So this is going to be f of this stuff in here, f inverse of 7, you see, is -7. And then to evaluate the function, f of -7 is going to be 7. And that makes complete sense. We mapped from f inverse of 7 to -7 and evaluating the function of that, went back to 7. So let's do one more of these just to really feel comfortable with mapping back-and-forth between these two sets, between applying the function and the inverse of the function. Let's evaluate f inverse of f inverse of 13. f inverse of 13. What is that going to be? I encourage you to pause the video and try to figure it out. What's f inverse of 13? That's, looking at this table right here, f inverse goes from 13 to 5. You see it over here, f went from 5 to 13, so f inverse is going to go from 13 to 5. So, f inverse of 13 is going to be 5, so this is the same thing as f inverse of 5. And f inverse of 5? -9. So this is going to be equal to -9. Once again, f inverse goes from 5 to -9. So at first when you start doing these functions and inverse of functions it looks a little confusing, hey, I'm going back and forth, but you just have to remember a function maps from one set of numbers to another set of numbers. The inverse of that function goes the other way. If the function goes from 9 to 8, the inverse is going to go from 8 to 9. So one way to think about it is, you just switch these columns. Hopefully, that clarifies more things than it confuses.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-relations-functions
" Let's see if we can extend the path counting brain teaser to three dimensions. So let's say that I had a three by three cube. I'll keep it at three by three to keep the math from getting too hairy. So let me draw it like that. I won't use a line tool just because-- well, maybe I should have. So let's see. The front of the cube looks something like that. That's the front of the cube. And the cube goes backwards like that. Comes down. Goes like that. It's a three by three, like a Rubik's Cube. I could have drawn this little bit better, but I think this will meet our needs. OK. There you go. Three by three cube. And so our goal is to get from this back left cube. This top corner back left cube. And get to this front, bottom right cube. So this is our goal. I'll do it in this yellow. This is our goal right there. And we're allowed to either go forward. From any cube, these are our three operations or our three movements we can do. We can go forward, or I guess towards the front. We could go down. Or we can go to the right. So I can draw it here. We can go from that cube to that cube. So just like the two dimensional problem, you're only allowed to make forward progress. You're not allowed to come down here, and then go to over here. You're allowed to go down here, then here, but then you're not allowed to go up. So every step you're getting a little bit closer, from this back left top cube, to this front bottom, right cube. And so the same question applies, how many different ways are there to get from there to there? And you can pause it now and try it yourself, because I'm about to explain how to do it. And the first thing, when you tried to do it yourself, is to realize, boy this is hard to visualize. Even if I had to draw this out, I'd have to go in and then out. I mean, how do I even visualize a three dimensional cube like this? And the best way to do is to separately visualize each of the separate layers. So let's do that. Let's make this the magenta layer up here. We'll call that layer one. So this is the magenta layer up here. And you'll see what I'm doing in a second. This is the mauve layer right there. And then finally I'll do the orange layer. The orange layer is that one right there. What we can do is separately draw each of these layers. So first, let's do the magenta layer. So the magenta layer will look like this. And now I'll use things that help-- nope, not like that. I want to use the other tool. The magenta layer. Let me draw some squares in here. It's like that, and like that, and like that, and like that. And then, the middle one was the mauve layer. We'll draw that. The mauve layer looks something like that. And you can imagine I'm slicing it, and just looking at it from above. That's the idea here. And it's going to help us visualize this problem. So the mauve layer looks something like that. And then finally the orange layer. Looks like this. And we're almost ready to actually start doing the problem. Good enough. So just to make sure we understand our visualization, this layer up here-- we call that layer one. We could but this as box one. This layer is layer two. So I'll put a little two here. And I don't want to get these confused with the paths and all that, so I'm writing it really small. And this is layer three, or level three. And that's right there. And just to make sure you understand, this corner right there, this is our start point. And that's right there. Right? Because this is a whole top. So this is the back left of the top. And are finish point, the bottom right, is right here. So, essentially, our problem goes from, how many ways to get from there to there, to how many ways to get from there to there? So let's just stay within a layer. So how many ways can I get to this point right here? Well I can only go from this point, and go straight in the layer like that. So there's only one way to get there. That movement is the exact same movement as this right here. Going from this box to this box. So there's one way to get there. That's the same thing as there. And similarly, I could go there. And I can just go one more step. So there's only one way to get there. And that's like going there and then there. And by the same logic, I could go one to the right here. That's the only way to get there. Or I could go two to the right there. And that's the only way to get there. And now if you watched the two dimensional path counting brain teaser, you know that there's two ways to get here. And the logic is, well you could draw it out. You could go like that. One, two. And that's the same thing as saying, one, two. Though it's easier to visualize here. But the general logic was, well, to know how many ways to get to any square, think about the squares that lead to it, and how many ways can I get to those two squares? And then sum them up. And by the same logic-- so there's two ways to get here. That's that cell. Three ways to get here, right? Two plus one is three. One plus two is three. And three plus three is six. So there were six ways to get to this cube right there, from that one. So this isn't too different from the two dimensional problem so far. But now it gets interesting. So how many ways-- I did this in yellow, but I should have done it in the color of that layer. How many ways are there to get to this cell right here? This cell is that one right there. Well, I start here. And I can just go straight down. There's only one way to be there. But I go straight down. So there's only one way to get there. Actually let's extend. There's only one way to get here, if I'm going straight down. And so there's only one way to get to this cell too. I'd have to go straight down again. So there's only one way to get there. Hopefully you understand the way we're visualizing it. This is the bottom row. And there's only one way. You go from here, straight down to there, straight down to there. And that's the only way to get there. Fair enough. Now this is where it gets interesting. How many ways are there to get to this cell? Well in our old example, there was only one way in two dimensions to go from this cell. But now we can go from this cell, and we could come from above. And where's above? Above is right there. So now we add this cell to that cell. So one plus one is, there are two ways to get there. How many ways to get to this? You can't even see it. This is kind of in the back middle of this cube. How many ways to get there? Well, there's two ways to come from this direction. And I can also come from above right there. So two plus one is three. How many ways to get here? Well, one from behind. And then one from above. So that's two. And you see a little bit of symmetry. And how many ways to come here. Well there's two here. From going straight forward. Two ways to go that way. And then one way to come from above. This is two, and we're on this cell. So if we wanted to know how many ways to get to this cell? There's two ways to go from there. And then one way from above. So that's three. And now, right here, how many ways to get to this cell? There's three ways. I could come from here, from here, or from above. So I have the two plus two plus two is six. Likewise, here, I can come from six plus three is nine. But I can also come from above. From here. So there's 12 ways to get there. And you can do the same logic. How many ways to get here? Well, within the same row there are nine ways. Six plus three is nine. And then you could come from above as well. That's 12. And finally, how many ways to get to this cell right here, which is this one right there? Well, there's 12 ways to get here. So I could go all of those ways. 12 ways to come from behind it, so that's 24. And then six ways to come from above. So 12 plus 12 is 24 plus six is 30. I think you're seeing the pattern. So how many ways to get here? Well it's one plus two, which is three. How many ways to get here? Well it's three plus three, which is six. How many ways to get here? It's one way here, and two from above. So it's three. How many ways to get here? Well, three from behind and three from above. That's six. Here, it's three plus three is six. But you could also come from above. So six again. So that is 12. How many ways to get here? 12 plus six is 18. But there's 12 ways to come from above as well. So 18 plus 12 is 30. And by the same logic, there's 18 ways to get here from these two cells. But I could also come from above. So that is 30. So how many ways to get to this last cell? Well there's 30 from this direction. 30 ways from there. 30 ways from behind it. That's 60. And then there's another 30 ways to come from above. So there are 90 ways. I could write that there, but you can't see it. 90 ways to get from that cell over there to this cell over here. And then the last video, I made the analogy to the 1binomial theorem. 1And I'll leave you to think about what the three 1dimensional analogy is. 1And I'll throw out a word which is never really 1mentioned in math class, because it's normally too 1hairy to deal with. 1Think about formulating a trinomial theorem, to help you 1multiply things like x plus y plus z to nth power. 1And think about how this cube, or an extension of it. 1This is a three by three by three cube. 1But imagine if it was, you know, an n by n by n cube. 1Then you can start taking things to arbitrary powers. 1So I'll leave you to think about this. 1But I just thought this was a neat visualization problem, 1which is really not any more difficult than the last one. 1Actually, before I leave you I'll leave you with just a 1general principle. 1And this is actually really useful for some standardized 1tests, or just logic games. 1If I'm trying to get to this cell. 1And let's say there's a bunch of ways to get here. 1And it has to have direction. 1So I won't go into a whole graph theory thing. 1But it has to have direction. 1And you can't have cycles. 1Because then you can have infinite ways to get to a 1certain point. 1And let's say that there are x ways to get there. 1Y ways to get there. z ways to get there. 1And a ways to get there. 1I'll cycle through the alphabet. 1And this is just a subset of the larger graph. 1This graph could have a bunch of connections. 1This is just where we are. 1These are all of the nodes that connect to this. 1The general rule that we've learned in the last two brain 1teasers is, you say, OK, how can I get to this node? 1Well I can go from here, here, here, or here. 1And I just have to add up. 1So if I can get from here, there's x ways to 1come via this node. 1Y ways to come via that note. 1z ways to come via that node. 1a ways to come via that node. 1So the total ways to get to that node is x plus 1y plus z plus a. 1And actually, you'll see problems like this if you ever 1plan on becoming a lawyer. 1They actually do have problems like this on the LSAT, that 1aren't maybe as complicated as what we did here. 1But you need understand this principle. 1Anyway hope you enjoyed that.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_puzzles

" -  In this video, we're going to see if we can compute what three divided by 0.75 is equal to, and I'll give you a little bit of a hint before I tell you to pause the video. So let's imagine three wholes right over here, and what if we were to think of these three wholes, these three ones, and what if we were to think about them in terms of hundredths? Well then we could, once we express these as hundredths, we could say, well how many groups of 75 hundredths can we divide this into? How many equal groups of 75 hundredths? To help you think about that, here's a little bit of a visualization where three is divided into equal groups of 75 hundredths. So pause this video and use what I have, this little visual here, as a big hint to figure out what three divided by 75/100 is. All right, now let's do it together. So as I said, we started with three ones, or three wholes, however you want to think about it, and you could divide division by 75/100 as saying, well how many equal groups of 75 hundredths can you divide these three wholes into? And so we thought about these three wholes in terms of hundredths, and the way it's been color coded, it actually has already been divided into four equal groups of 75 hundredths. You can count these, so this is 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and then five hundredths. So this right over here, this is one group of 75 hundredths. Then in green you have another group of 75 hundredths. So you have 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and then 75, so that right over, let me use a color I can see. This right over here is our second group. This is our first group right over there. Then that's our third group, these are all equal groups of 75 hundredths, and that's our fourth equal group of 75 hundredths in the green again. So how many equal groups of 75 hundredths can you divide three wholes into? Well, clearly it is equal to four.",math_cc-fifth-grade-math_divide-decimals
" Find the slope of the linear function defined by the table. And they give us a table here. They define certain amount, I guess these are shift lengths, and then they say how many hours is a half a day, is a full day, is two days, is a week, is a month. And then they tell us how much money do we make in each of those time periods. If we work four hours, we make $54, if we work eight hours, we make $108, so forth and so on. And then they say what does the slope represent in this situation? So we have to find the slope and figure out what it represents. So just as a bit of review, slope just equals the change in the dependent variable divided by the change in the independent variable. So how much does a dependent variable change for any amount of change of the independent variable? In this situation, the dependent variable is the amount of money you make because it is dependent on how much time you work, this is independent. So let's call the independent variable x, the dependent variable y. So our slope in this situation would be change in y divided by change in x. So how much does the amount of money I make change when I work a certain number of hours, when my hours worked change by a certain amount. So let's just take some data points here. We could take really any of these data points, I'll take some of the smaller numbers. So let's say if when I go from four to eight hours, so my change in x is going to be what? If I go from four to eight, might change in x is going to be eight minus four, four hours, right? So this is going to be my change in x. I'm just picking these two points, I could have picked four and forty if I wanted, but the math would become more complicated. But how much does the amount of money earn change if I go from four hours to eight hours? Well, I go from $54 to $108, so the difference in the amount of money I make is $108 minus $54. So what is my change in my dependent variable? Well, that's going to be $108 minus $54, that's just $54. And then what was the change in the amount of hours I worked? Well, the change in the hours I worked was four hours. So, if I work four more hours, I make 54 more dollars. Let me put a little equal sign there. So what is 54 divided by four? So four goes into 54-- looks like there's going to be decimal here-- four goes into five one time, one times four is four. Subtract, you get five minus four is one, bring down this four you get 14. Four goes into 14 three times, three times four is 12. Fourteen minus 12 is two, bring down a 0 right here, four goes into 20 five times. And of course you have this decimal right here. Five times four is 20. Subtract, no remainder. So this is equal to 13.5, but since we're talking in terms of dollars, maybe say $13.50, because that's our numerator, right? This is money earned, dollars per hour, because that's our denominator, dollars per hour. So that essentially answers our question. What does the slope represent in this situation? It represents the hourly wage for working at wherever this might be. Frankly, for this problem, you didn't even have to take two data points. We could have said hey, if you work four hours and make $54, 54 divided by four is 13.50. Or we could have said hey, if we work eight hours, we get $108, 108 divided by eight is 13.50. So you didn't even have to take two data points here, you could have just taken any of these numbers divided by any of these numbers. But hopefully we also learned a little bit about what slope is.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-linear-equations-functions
" -  So let's think about something a little bit. What do you think 17 divided by two is going to be? Well, you might immediately realize that it's not obvious what you need to multiply two by in order to get to 17. There's no whole number that I could put here that gets us to 17. We know that two times, let's see, two times eight is a little bit less than that. Two times eight is equal to 16. And we know that two times nine is going to be a little bit more than that, is equal to 18. And so this question mark, two times question mark is equal to 17. This helps us know that our question mark, our unknown value here is going to be between eight and nine. It is going to be eight point something. So let's do another example. If someone were to ask you, hey, let's think about 18 divided by four. And you don't have to figure out exactly what it is just yet, but I want you to think about what two consecutive whole numbers is 18 divided by four, whatever that is, what is that between? Well, we could do something similar. We could say, all right, let's see, four times four is equal to 16, so that doesn't quite get us to 18. We could say that four times five is equal to 20, so that's more than 18. So four times question mark is equal to 18. This helps us realize that because 18 is between 16 and 20, this question mark right over here is going to be between four and five. So 18 divided by four is going to be four point something. Now, another way of thinking about or estimating what division might result in is through an inequality. So if I were to say 87 divided by nine, how would you compare that to 10 over here? So there's a couple of ways you could compare it. You could say, hey, maybe this is greater than 10. Maybe it's equal to 10. Maybe it is less than 10. So pause this video and see if you can figure that out. What would you put here? Is it less than, greater than, or equal to 10? Well, we know it's not equal to 10. We know that 90 divided by nine is equal to 10. And let's see, if we go one multiple of nine less than that, we know that 81 divided by nine is equal to nine. And so 87 divided by nine is in between these two values. Let me do this in another color. So 87 divided by nine is going to be something in between nine and 10. And so it is going to be less than 10. So the whole point of this video is to start to get us a little bit comfortable with this idea of dividing where we might get an answer that is not a whole number. And in the future we'll learn how to compute that, but for now we're just learning to estimate and just get a sense of, hey, okay, this is going to be between eight and nine. This is going to be between four and five. This is going to be between nine and 10, which just means it's going to be nine point something, which means it's going to be less than 10.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_division
" - All right now we have another combustion reaction. Instead of ethylene, we now have ethane, C2H6, has two carbons and six hydrogen atoms in each molecule of ethane, and it is reacting. It's ethane gas, it is reacting with molecular oxygen in gaseous form and they combust to form carbon dioxide gas and liquid water, and like we've seen in previous examples, this chemical equation is not balanced. How can we tell? Well here on the left hand side we have two carbons. Here on the right hand side we have one carbon. Here on the left hand side we have six hydrogens. Here on the right hand side we only have two hydrogens. Here on the left hand side we have two oxygens. On the right hand side we have two plus, three oxygens, so none of the elements here are balanced. But like we did in the example of ethylene, whenever you see this where you have several somewhat complex molecules involved, it's good to save the element that is in a molecule by itself for last, because you can just tweak this to change the number of oxygens without it having any other side effects on the number of carbons or hydrogens. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to first balance, like we've done before, the carbons and the hydrogens, which are going to have implications on the oxygens because if I change the number here, it's going to change the number of oxygens. If I change the number here it's going to change the number of oxygens. But lucky for me I have this dioxygen molecule on the left hand side that I can just tweak at the end to balance the entire chemical equation. So let's start with, you know last time we started with carbon, let's start with hydrogen this time. Just for kicks. So over here I have six hydrogens on the left hand side, of the entire left hand side I only have six hydrogen atoms. On the right hand side I only have two right now, so if I want to have six I would multiply these two by three so now I have three water molecules, each of them have two hydrogen atoms, so I'm going to have six, six hydrogen atoms on the right hand side. Fair enough. Now let's go to the carbon. Remember I'm saving oxygen for last. Carbon on the left hand side I have two carbons. How many carbons do I have on the right hand side? Well right now I only have one, but I can change that very easily. Instead of having one molecule of carbon dioxide, I can have two molecules of carbon dioxide. And so now my carbons are balanced, two carbons, two carbons. And now let's go to the oxygens. So right now, right now on, I'll do this in a mauve color, right now on the left hand side I have two oxygens, but on the right hand side what do I have? Let's see, I have two times two, so this right over here is four oxygens, and then I have three water molecules, each of them have one oxygen atom, so three times one, so this is going to be three right over here. So on the entire right hand side I have seven oxygen atoms and on the left I only have two. So what can I do here? What can multiply by two to get to seven? Two times what is equal to seven? Well two times three-and-a-half is equal to seven. So two times three-and-a-half is equal to seven. Remember I have two here, I'm saying two times something is equal to seven. I want to get to the four plus the three. Well I multiply it by three point five, and now I have seven, seven oxygen atoms on both sides of my chemical equation. But like we've seen in previous videos, it is not standard to just leave a three-and-a-half here, it's kind of this weird notion of three-and-a-half molecules, we like to have whole numbers here. So how do we make sure we have all whole number coefficients in front of our molecules? Well we could just multiply everything by two, then this thing is going to become a seven, this thing is going to become a two, this is going to become a four, this is going to become a six, so let's just do that. I'll write the whole reaction over again. So I have my ethane, and I won't write actually what state it's in just to save some time, plus some molecular oxygen. They combust, they yield, so these are the reactants, the products are carbon dioxide gas and liquid water, and liquid water. So let's see, you multiply, if you say that there was a one out here before, we're going to multiply that by two to get two. We had a three point five here, multiply that by two, you get a seven here. We had a two right over here, multiply that by two you get a four. Once again I'm just multiplying all the coefficients by two just like you did in algebraic equations in your algebra classes. And then finally three times two is six. And we're all balanced. We were balanced here but we didn't have whole number coefficients. Multiplying everything by two gave us the whole number coefficients and we are much happier.",science_ap-chemistry_stoichiometry-and-molecular-composition-ap
" In this video, we're going to hopefully understand why the exponential form of a complex number is actually useful. So let's say we want to solve the equation x to the third power is equal to 1. So we want to find all of the real and/or complex roots of this equation right over here. This is the same thing as x to the third minus 1 is equal to 0. So we're looking for all the real and complex roots of this. And there are ways to do this without exponential form of a complex number. But the technique we're going to see in this video could be applied if this was x to the fifth minus 1, or x to the 13th minus 1. And it's also going to show us the patterns that emerge when you start looking at things on an Argand diagram. So to do this, let's think about the exponential representation of 1. So let's just say z is equal to 1. 1 is a complex number. It's a real number. All real numbers are also complex numbers. They're a subset. They're in the complex plane. They just don't have an imaginary part. So let's draw this on an Argand diagram. So that's my real axis. This is my imaginary axis. And so this is the real. This is the imaginary. And if I wanted to represent z equals 1, it only has a real part. So let me just draw 1 all around. Negative 1. Negative 1. z looks like this. z would look like that, a position vector that just goes to 1, 0. One way to view it-- this is the same thing as equal to 1 plus 0i. Now, let's put this in exponential form. Well, its magnitude is pretty straightforward. The magnitude of z is just the length of this vector, or it's the absolute value of 1. That's just going to be 1. Now, what's the argument of z? What's the angle that this vector makes with the positive real axis? Well, it's on the positive real axis. It's a real number. So it has no angle. So the arg of z is 0. So that might not be too interesting so far. We just figured out that 1 is equal to 1 times e to the 0i. And this is kind of obvious. e to the 0-- this is just going to be 0. 0 times i is 0. e to the 0 is going to be 1, times 1 is equal to 1. Not a big deal there. But what is neat is that this argument-- you could view it as 0 radians, or you could go all the way around and add 2 pi to it and get to the same point. So the argument of our complex number-- or of the number 1, really-- could also be an angle of 2 pi, or an angle of 4 pi, or an angle of 6 pi, or an angle of 8 pi. So we can write 1 as 1 times e-- I won't write the 1 anymore-- 1 times e to the 2 pi i, or 1 times e to the 4 pi i. And the reason why this is interesting is then this equation right here can be written in multiple ways. It can be written as x to the third is equal to 1. It could be written as x to the third is equal to e to the 2 pi i. Or it could be written as x to the third is equal to e to the 4 pi i. And this is interesting, and we're going to see this in a second. Let's take both sides of all these equations to the one-third power to solve for x. So to the one-third. We're going to take that to the one-third. We're going to do that same thing over here. We're just taking everything to the one-third power to solve for the x's in each of these equations. To the one-third power. So this first equation over here becomes x is equal to 1 to the one-third power, which is just equal to 1. Now, what's the second equation become? This second equation-- x is equal to e to the-- well, this is going to be the 2 pi over 3, i power. And then this equation over here is going to be-- so x is going to be equal to-- obviously, the 3 to the one-third, that just becomes x to the 1. Let me do that same blue. x over here is going to be equal to e to the 4 pi over 3, i. So let's think about this for a little bit. What is this? So immediately, what's the argument here? So these are three different roots. Let me call this x1, x2, and x3. So these are three different numbers. One of the roots is 1. That's pretty clear over here. 1 is one of the cube roots of itself. But these are other numbers. And these are going to be complex numbers. So let's visualize these numbers a little bit. So what is the argument? The magnitude of x2 is still clearly 1. It's the coefficient out in front of the e. It's clearly 1. Let me do that same color. The magnitude of x3 is also clearly going to be 1. But what is the argument of x2? What is phi? What is the argument? Well, it's 2 pi over 3. So how would we draw x2? So the angle is 2 pi over 3. It's easier for me to visualize in degrees. So 2 pi is 360 degrees. 360 degrees divided by 3 is 120 degrees. So this is going to be-- 120 degrees is 60 short of-- so it's going to look like this. So this angle right here, its argument is going to be 120 degrees, which is the same thing as 2 pi over 3. And it's going to have the exact same length. So let me do it in the same color. So this is x1. So that is this green color right over here. x2 is this magenta one right over here. And they all have the same magnitude. So we really just rotate it. We rotate it 120 degrees. And what about x3? What's its argument? What's x3's argument? Its argument is 4 pi over 3. That's the same thing as 720 degrees over 3, if we were to put it into degrees. And so 3 goes into 720-- what is it? 240? 720. 240. Right. I should have known that. So 240 degrees-- we're going to go 180 degrees, and then go another 60 degrees. So it's going to be right over here. So let me draw it like this. It's going to be right over here. That angle right over there is 4 pi over 3 radians, which is equal to 240 degrees. And once again, it has the same magnitude. So what we just saw is when I take the cube roots of this real number, I'm essentially taking the entire-- I guess we could call it the entire circle or the entire 360 degrees or the entire 2 pi radians-- and I'm dividing it into three, essentially. This is one third. Then we have another 120 degrees. And then we have another 120 degrees. And so you see the pattern of where all of the roots are. And in case you're still not satisfied, you're just like, well, you said you would find complex roots. Yeah, I'm not used to this or this as actually being complex numbers. I actually want it to be in the form a plus bi-- we can easily figure it out from this right over here. So x2-- it's going to be equal to the cosine of 2 pi over 3 plus i times the sine of 2 pi over 3. And if you look at this over here, we can figure out what those things are going to be. This is the angle right over here. If this angle right over here is 60 degrees-- which it is, because this up here is 30 degrees-- the hypotenuse, or the length, is 1, then this over here is square root of 3 over 2. And then this distance right over here is negative 1/2. So x2 is going to be equal to-- cosine of 2 pi over 3 is-- negative 1/2. Did I do that right? Yep, negative 1/2, plus i times sine of 2 pi over 3. That's this height over here, which is square root of 3 over 2, i. So that's x2. And we could do the exact same thing with x3. x3 is going to be equal to its x value. Or I should say its real value is going to be the exact same thing. It's going to be negative 1/2. And then, its imaginary value, so this angle right over here-- this just from the negative real axis down 1to the vector-- is going to be negative 60 degrees. 1So this height right over here is 1going to be negative square root of 3 over 2. 1So it's negative 1/2 minus the square root of 3 over 2, i. 1So using this technique, we were able to find 1the three complex roots of 1. 1This is one of them. 1This is another one. 1And of course, 1 is one of them as well. 1Where did we do that? 11 is one of them as well. 1And you could use this exact same technique 1if we were finding the fourth roots. 1We would take the 2 pi radians, or the 360 degrees, 1and divide it into 4. 1And so it would actually be this. 1It would be i. 1It would be negative 1. 1And it would be negative i. 1And we know if you take i to the fourth, you get 1. 1If you take negative i to the fourth, you get 1. 1And if you take negative 1 to the fourth, you get 1. 1And if you take 1 to the fourth, you get 1. 1And so you can find the eighth roots of 1 1using this technique. 1Now, the other question that might be popping in your brain 1is, why did I stop at e to the 4 pi i? 1Why didn't I go on and say, well, 1this is equal to e to the 6 pi i and look for another root? 1And so if I did that, if I said x to the third-- let's say 1I wanted to find a fourth root here, maybe. 1x to the third is equal to e to the 6 pi i. 1And I take both sides of this equation 1to the one-third power. 1Taking this to the one third, I would get e to the 2 pi i. 1Well, what's e to the 2 pi i? e to the 2 pi 1i would just get us back to 1. 1So when I added 2 pi again, it just gets us back to this root 1again. 1If I took e to the 6 pi, if I took e to the 8 pi, 1I would get this root again. 1So you're going to get only three roots if you're 1finding the third roots of something. 1Anything beyond that, it just becomes redundant.",math_precalculus_complex
" Now that we have a little bit of a review of oxidation and reduction under our belts, let's see if we can apply what we now, maybe, re-understand to cellular respiration. So cellular respiration, for every mole of a glucose, C6H12O6, we combine that-- and maybe that's in an aqueous state. It's dissolved in water. We combine that with six moles of molecular oxygen. And then our cells perform cellular respiration in a whole series of steps. And I'll do more videos on that. I'll just abbreviate it. And then we end up with six moles of carbon dioxide. We have to breathe this oxygen in order to perform cellular respiration and we have to breathe this carbon dioxide out because it's just a byproduct of cellular respiration. Six moles of carbon dioxide, six moles of water. And the whole point of cellular respiration is, plus some energy is generated by this reaction. And our bodies store this energy. Well, some of it is just turned into heat. But the whole point of cellular respiration is to store it as 38 ATPs, which we've learned already is the energy currency of biological systems. And then our bodies, or biological systems in general, can use these ATPs to contract muscles or generate nerve impulses or grow cells or divide cells or whatever else that a biological system has to do. In the last video we learned a little bit about oxidation and reduction, so let's apply those ideas here. Now we saw in the last video that a chemist would say-- let me write it this way-- a chemist would say that oxidation means losing electrons, or not being able to hog them. While a chemist will tell you that reduction is gaining electrons. And if you have trouble remembering, oxidation is losing, that's kind of OIL, that's the mnemonic. Oxygen is losing electrons. Reduction is gaining. Or, RIG. So OIL RIG. This is what you learned in chemistry class. Now biologists or biochemists will say, oh, well, you know I like to define it a little bit differently. A biologist will say that oxidation is losing hydrogen atoms. And they'll say reduction is gaining hydrogen atoms. And we saw in the last video that this definition is actually hard when you're applying it to hydrogen because it's not like a hydrogen atom can lose itself or gain itself. And the reason why we said that these two ideas are consistent is because if I'm talking about a carbon and a carbon is losing a hydrogen. So let's say I have some compound that looks like this. Maybe it's connected to a bunch of other things someplace else. And then later on the carbon-- let's say I have a carbon that looks like that and I have an oxygen that's maybe bound to another oxygen. I'm doing a very kind of hand-wavy explanation here. And maybe that oxygen is bonded to something else. This is what I start off with. And on the other side of this equation I end up with something that looks like this. Where a carbon is bonded to an oxygen. And maybe that other oxygen is bonded to this hydrogen. The biologist will say, oh, this carbon has been oxidized because it lost its hydrogen. The hydrogen went from here-- I'll do it in a different color-- went from this carbon to this oxygen. And the biologist would also say that this oxygen has been reduced. It's been reduced because it gained hydrogens. But the reality, or maybe the chemists' definition, which I like a little bit more is, over here because carbon is more electronegative, we see carbon is much more electronegative than hydrogen. And oxygen is even more electronegative than carbon. When any of these guys bond with hydrogen they're going to hog the electron. So here, carbon got to hog the electron. So here, carbon hogs electrons. While here, carbon gets its electrons hogged by oxygen. So here, oxygen hogs. So by losing the hydrogen, the carbon actually lost its opportunity to hog electrons. And since it ended up bonding with an oxygen, it not only can't hog hydrogen's electrons but then it gets its electrons hogged by an even more electronegative atom. So that's why these two definitions are consistent. Same thing with the oxygen. Here it's bonding with another oxygen, not hogging anything. But when it gains the hydrogen it's able to hog hydrogen's electrons. Because it's so much more electronegative. Or you could say that it's gaining electrons. So that's why these two definitions are somewhat consistent. Although sometimes they fall apart if we're not dealing with hydrogen. The chemistry definition applies more consistently to everything. But sometimes the biologists' definition is easier to kind of glance at. Or you'll actually see it written in textbooks. So let's go back to cellular respiration and try to figure out what's being oxidized and reduced. So if we look over here. Over here we have our glucose. And actually I copied and pasted from Wikipedia a glucose molecule. And actually there's one error here. And maybe I should edit it on Wikipedia. There should be another hydrogen bonded to that carbon right there. But as you see, all of the hydrogens, they're either bonded to an oxygen or a carbon over here. On the left-hand side, they're either bonded to an oxygen or a carbon. If we were to write its oxidation state, in every case it's bonded to something that's more electronegative. So it's going to be giving up its electrons. So it will have a plus one oxidation state. And oxygen, in every case, is either bonded to a carbon or a hydrogen. And so, oxygen, if it's bonded to a carbon or a hydrogen, is going to hog an electron from either one of those guys. So in every situation in glucose, oxygen has a two minus or a minus two oxidation state. And carbon, since this whole thing is neutral, one would think that carbon would have a neutral oxidation state. And if you go through this, you actually find that most of these carbons do have neutral oxidation states. Let me circle a few. So for example, this carbon right here, it's hogging an electron from this hydrogen. But then it gets an electron hogged by this oxygen. And then of course it does nothing with the carbon. So that's neutral. This is neutral for the same reason. This is neutral for the same reason. This one is also neutral for the same reason. It's bonded with two carbons. It has an electron hogged by oxygen. But then it hogs an electron from hydrogen. So it's neutral. So four of these carbons are neutral. This carbon right here has two electrons hogged by oxygens. And then it gets to take one back from the hydrogen. So it has a plus one oxidation state. This one is the opposite. It has two hydrogens that it hogs from. Then it has to give one away to the oxygen. So this has a minus one. So these two cancel out. On average, you can say that the carbons in glucose have a neutral oxidation state. And I'm dealing with the chemist definition. And I'm going to show you that they're essentially equivalent. Here all of the oxygens have no oxidation state. Because they're just bonded. Let me do it in a better color. No oxidation state or neutral oxidation state because they're double bonded with oxygen. No one's hogging from anyone. They're obviously equally electronegative. If we look at the products, carbon dioxide looks like this. So, in either of these cases, oxygen is hogging two electrons from this carbon. So it has a minus two oxygen state. This oxygen is hogging two electrons from carbon. So it has a minus two oxidation state. And this carbon is getting all of its valence electrons, all four, hogged by the oxygen. So it has a plus four oxidation state. It's lost four electrons, you can imagine. Because it's getting hogged. So that's carbon. So we could write this as four plus for the carbon. And then each oxygen has a two minus. And we can do the math later on to figure out what the total is. And then, if we look at the water-- we've looked at this before-- the oxygen is hogging two electrons, one from each hydrogen. So two minus. And then each of the hydrogens have a plus one oxidation state. So if you want to do a half reaction for cellular respiration, and in the chemists' sense of things, just dealing with electrons, you can immediately say, I start with 12 hydrogens on this side. Let me just write it this way. So H12 on this side. They all have a plus one oxidation state. And then cellular respiration occurs. And now I have 12 hydrogens. I could write the 12 a little bit differently here. But they still have a plus one. Each of them still has a plus one oxidation state. So nothing from an oxidation reduction point of view happens to the hydrogen. Now if we do the carbon. On the left-hand side of the equation, we have six carbons. They have a neutral oxidation state. But then on the right-hand side of the equation, what happens? I now have six carbons. Written a little bit differently. But I have six carbons. And they each have a plus four oxidation state. Which means that they have lost four electrons. Or their hypothetical charge, by losing those four electrons, has gone up by four. Because they're losing negatively charged electrons. So the six carbons, after cellular respiration, end up with six oxidized carbons, with plus 1four oxidation states. 1Plus-- so each of these lost four electrons. 1We have six of them. 14 times 6 is 24 electrons. 1These are the electrons that the carbon lost. So we see in 1cellular respiration that the carbon is oxidized. 1Oxidation is losing electrons. 1We see in cellular respiration, we draw the half 1reaction, carbon is losing, the six carbons are losing a 1collective 24 electrons. 1And then finally, if I were to do the oxygen on this side. 1I've lost my equation up here. 1So over here I have two oxygens. 1And I'm going to draw them a little bit separate. 1So I have these six oxygens here that have a minus two 1oxidation state. 1On the left-hand side. 1So I'll draw it like this. 1They have a minus two oxidation state. 1And then I have these 12 oxygens that 1are completely neutral. 1So I won't even write an oxidation state or oxidation 1number there. 1And then after we perform cellular 1respiration, what happens? 1Well now I have, in the carbon dioxide, I have 12 carbons 1that have a minus two oxidation state. 1Six times O2. 1So let me write that down from the carbon dioxide. 1So I have six O2s that all have a to 1minus oxidation state. 1And then I have another six oxygens that have a minus two 1oxidation state. 1So plus six oxygens that have a minus two oxidation state. 1So if you think about it, over here I had a collective 1oxidation state on all of the oxygens. 1These were neutral. 1I have 6 times minus 2, that's a minus 12. 1You can kind of view it as collective charge 1of all six of them. 16 times minus 2. 1Here I have 6 times minus 2, which is minus 12. 1And then I have 6 times 2 oxygens per molecule. 1So that's 12 times minus 2. 1That's minus 24. 1So to go from a minus 12 to a total oxidation or kind of 1hypothetical charge of minus 36, I must 1have gained 24 electrons. 1And those 24 electrons that I gained, that the oxygens 1gained, are the same 24 electrons that the carbons 1lost. So from the chemistry point of 1view, it's very clear. 1Carbon was oxidized. 1And oxygen, which gained electrons-- RIG. 1Reduction is gaining. 1Oxygen is reduced. 1And this is all a bit of review. 1But it's nice to see it in the context of cellular 1respiration. 1And this actually kind of answers one of the questions 1of where does this energy come from? 1In any of these chemical reactions, when you see energy 1being produced, it's because electrons are going from a 1higher energy state to a lower energy state. 1If I have an electron that's up here in a high energy state 1and it is able to go to a more comfortable state, lower 1orbital or lower energy orbital. 1So low energy or more stable energy state. 1It'll generate energy in the form of heat, or maybe this 1can do some work in some way, help make ATP molecules. 1And so when you see these half reactions, you see these 24 1electrons, that are being lost by carbon, 1carbon is being oxidized. 1And they're going to oxygen. 1They're going in a whole series of steps. 1It's not just happening in one huge explosion. 1It's happening over a huge series of steps. 1And as it does that, it's entering lower and lower 1energy states. 1And as these electrons enter the lower energy states, 1essentially by going from the carbons and being pushed to 1the oxygens, that's where the energy is coming from. 1That's where the energy to make the 38 1ATPs is coming from. 1So, so far we talked a little bit about how a 1chemist views oxidation. 1I touched at the beginning of the video of how a biologist 1views oxidation. 1And then we saw that cellular respiration from a chemist's 1point of view is clearly showing that the carbon is 1being oxidized. 1It's losing electrons. 1And that the oxygen is being reduced. 1It's gaining electrons. 1It's being reduced. 1That electrons are going from this carbon and they're going, 1essentially, to these oxygens right here. 1Now how does the biology definition of our 1position hold up? 1Well here it holds up pretty well. 1Because you can imagine, over here, all of the hydrogens in 1the equation are associated with glucose. 1And so they're either bonded, if you look at the structure 1of glucose. 1The hydrogens are either bonded to carbons or oxygens. 1So these are bonded to carbons and oxygens. 1And when you go on the right-hand side of the 1equation, all of the hydrogens are only bonding with oxygen. 1So net-net, carbon definitely lost hydrogens. 1And hydrogens and oxygen definitely gained hydrogens. 1Let me write that down. 1We see in respiration, carbon lost hydrogens. 1And oxygen gained hydrogens. 1And that's consistent. 1Because we see that by losing hydrogens we are being 1oxidized from a biologist point of view. 1And by gaining hydrogens, oxygen is being reduced. 1And just so you can kind of makes sense of this when you 1see this-- and when I start drawing out the mechanisms, 1which I will hopefully not make too hairy-- this process 1of transferring these hydrogens is facilitated by 1molecules like NAD plus and FAD. 1And we'll see that. 1But really, if we just want to reconcile the two notions, as 1the hydrogens are being transferred from one 1electronegative atom to another electronegative atom, 1what's really being transferred is the opportunity 1to hog electrons. 1If carbon has the hydrogen, it gets to hog the electrons. 1But if that hydrogen goes from the carbon-- and the whole 1atom; not just the nucleus, but the whole atom goes to the 1oxygen-- now the oxygen has gained that 1electron that it can hog. 1And carbon has lost the electron. 1So carbon has oxidized and oxygen has been reduced. 1And I mentioned this in previous videos. 1But probably the most confusing thing about 1oxidation is that you always want to say, all right, that 1must have something to do with oxygen. 1And it does. 1The word really comes from, what would 1oxygen do to something? 1So oxygen, when it bonds with things, it loses, it takes 1away their electrons. 1Or, in a reaction, it'll often take away the hydrogens. 1It took away the hydrogens from the 1carbon in this situation. 1So that's where the term oxidation comes from. 1But you don't have to have oxygen anywhere in your 1reaction for oxidation or reduction to occur. 1Anyway, hopefully you found that reasonably useful. 1This was actually a huge pain point for me when I learned, I 1got comfortable with the chemistry definition of 1oxidation reduction. 1And then all of a sudden you open up your biology book and 1they start talking about losing and gaining hydrogens, 1as opposed to electrons, and it took me a while to really 1reconcile these two notions.",science_biology_cellular-respiration-and-fermentation
" -  So let's say I have two functions that are the inverse of each other. So I have f of x, and then I also have g of x, which is equal to the inverse of f of x. And f of x would be the inverse of g of x as well. If the notion of an inverse function is completely unfamiliar to you, I encourage you to review inverse functions on Khan Academy. Now, one of the properties of inverse functions are that if I were to take g of f of x, g of f of x, or I could say the f inverse of f of x, that this is just going to be equal to x. And it comes straight out of what an inverse of a function is. If this is x right over here, the function f would map to some value f of x. So that's f of x right over there. And then the function g, or f inverse, if you input f of x into it, it would take you back, it would take you back to x. So that would be f inverse, or we're saying g is the same thing as f inverse. So all of that so far is a review of inverse functions, but now we're going to apply a little bit of calculus to it, using the chain rule. And we're gonna get a pretty interesting result. What I want to do is take the derivative of both sides of this equation right over here. So let's apply the derivative operator, d/dx on the left-hand side, d/dx on the right-hand side. And what are we going to get? Well, on the left-hand side, we would apply the chain rule. So this is going to be the derivative of g with respect to f of x. So that's going to be g prime of f of x, g prime of f of x, times the derivative of f of x with respect to x, so times f prime of x. And then that is going to be equal to what? Well, the derivative with respect to x of x, that's just equal to one. And this is where we get our interesting result. All we did so far is we used something we knew about inverse functions, and we'd use the chain rule to take the derivative of the left-hand side. But if you divide both sides by g prime of f of x, what are you going to get? You're going to get a relationship between the derivative of a function and the derivative of its inverse. So you get f prime of x is going to be equal to one over all of this business, one over g prime of f of x, g prime of f of x. And this is really neat because if you know something about the derivative of a function, you can then start to figure out things about the derivative of its inverse. And we can actually see this is true with some classic functions. So let's say that f of x is equal to e to the x, and so g of x would be equal to the inverse of f. So f inverse, which is, what's the inverse of e to the x? Well, one way to think about it is, if you have y is equal to e to the x, if you want the inverse, you can swap the variables and then solve for y again. So you'd get x is equal to e to the y. You take the natural log of both sides, you get natural log of x is equal to y. So the inverse of e to the x is natural log of x. And once again, that's all review of inverse functions. All right, if that's unfamiliar, review it on Khan Academy. So g of x is going to be equal to the natural log of x. Now, let's see if this holds true for these two functions. Well, what is f prime of x going to be? Well, this one of those amazing results in calculus. One of these neat things about the number e is that the derivative of e to the x is e to the x. And in other videos, we also saw that the derivative of the natural log of x is one over x. So let's see if this holds out. So we should get a result, f prime of x, e to the x should be equal to one over g prime of f of x. So g prime of f of x, so g prime is one over our f of x, and f of x is e to the x, one over e to the x. Is this indeed true? Yes, it is. One over, one over e to the x is just going to be e to the x. So it all checks out. And you could do the other way because these are inverses of each other. You could say g prime of x is going to be equal to one over f prime of g of x because they're inverses of each other. And actually, what's really neat about this, is that you could actually use this to get a sense of what the derivative of an inverse function is even going to be.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-derivatives-advanced
" When we wire blocks together, we will often run into a problem, and it's a range mismatch. For example, if we had the light intensity value being plugged into the pitch input of the speaker, let's see what would happen. Our light intensity value will send it a number between 0 and 100. However, the pitch input varies from 0 to 1,000, because it is a different measure. So these are all the different tones. If we think of it as a piano, this is the whole width of the piano. So if we'd plug these in directly, we actually would only hit 10% of all the values here, and this means this number would need to be scaled by some amount. And that is when we can use our math block to help us. The math block is very simple. It takes two inputs, A and B, which you can plug into just like I've shown you, and it spits out an output. So what you could do is multiply things together, or scale a number, or say, take whatever A is and add 5 to it and spit that as your output. So in this case, I have a light sensor and a sound sensor, and instead of plugging them together, I'm going to drop a math block in between them. And now provide the light intensity value to A-- that's the first input-- and I'm not going to give it another input B because I just want to either add, multiply, or do something to this number, A. And I'll take the result of whatever operation we come up with and plug it into tone frequency. So in the math block, just to be clear, the operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, absolute value, and square root, so you should select the correct operation here and fill in B. So let's say we wanted to divide it by 5. I would put 5 in the box for B. So if I provided the number 50, it would be divided by 5, which is 10, and 10 would spit out the other end. So fix this so that after the math block, the value ranges from 0 to 1,000.",science_electrical-engineering_lego-robotics
" -  Let's say we have some type of hard, flat, frictionless surface right over here. That's my drawing of a hard, flat, frictionless surface. And on that, I have a block, and that block is not accelerating in any direction. It is just sitting there. And let's say we know the weight of that block. It is a 10-newton block. So my question to you is, pause this video, and think about what are all of the forces that are acting on this block? All right, now let's work through this together. And to do it, I'm going to draw what's known as a free-body diagram to think about all of the forces. And the reason why it's called a free-body diagram is that we just focus on this one body. And we don't draw everything else around it, and we just draw the forces acting on it. And there's actually two typical ways of drawing a free-body diagram. I'll do them both. So first, I could draw it this way. So this is my block here. Now, I told you that it weighs 10 newtons. The weight of an object, that's the force of gravity acting on that object, and it would be downwards. So we have, from this 10 newtons right over here, we know that there is a downward force, the force of gravity acting on the mass of this object of 10 newtons. It has a magnitude of 10 newtons, and the force is acting downwards. We could say this is the magnitude of the force of gravity. And when you draw a free-body diagram, it's typical to show your vectors originating out of the center of that, of that object in your drawing. Now, my question to you is, is that the only force acting on this? If you think it is, what would happen to the object? Well, it would start or it would be accelerating downwards. But I just said that this is not accelerating in any direction. So there must be something that counteracts this, and there is. There's the normal force of this surface acting on the block. That surface is what's keeping the block from accelerating downwards. And I will do that with this vector right over here. So it's going to be going upwards, and it's going to have the exact same magnitude, just in the opposite direction. So I could say the magnitude of the normal force, the normal force is magnitude right over here, is also going to be equal to 10 newtons, but it's going upwards. And we can see that these two are going to net out, and so you have no net force acting in this vertical dimension. And I have no forces, I haven't thought about any or drawn any in the horizontal direction. And so that's why you have no net force in total, and this thing isn't going to be accelerated. Now, I mentioned that there's other ways to draw a free-body diagram. Another way that you might see it is like this, where you see the body. And from the outside of the body, you see the vectors being drawn. So in this situation, you have ten newtons downward, and you would have ten newtons upward. This is another way that you might see free-body diagrams drawn. Now, what I want to do is do something interesting to this block. Let me redraw it. So I have my surface here, my hard, frictionless surface, and it's flat. And I still have my block here. It's my 10-newton block. But now I'm going to apply a force to it. I am going to apply a force that is in this direction. It's in this direction, and its magnitude, let's say its magnitude is 20 newtons. And just so that we know the direction, this angle right over here, let's say that that is 60 degrees. I'll say theta is equal to 60 degrees. The magnitude of this force is equal to 20 newtons. So what would the free-body diagram now look like? Well, it might be tempting to just draw the force right on one of these free-body diagrams, something like that, something like that, and that would not be inaccurate. But we would have to watch out because this force is acting at an angle. So if we were to break it up into its horizontal and vertical components, some part of that force is acting downward. And so you're actually going to have a larger normal force to counteract that. And some other component is going to be working horizontally. And so what we want to do is actually break things up. 'Cause if you leave it in this angle, it gets very, very confusing. So what I want to do is I want to break up this new blue force into its horizontal and vertical components. And to do so, we just have to remember a little bit of our basic trigonometry. If I have a force like this, if I have a force like this and it is acting at an angle theta right over here, with the horizontal, and I want to break it up into its horizontal and its vertical components, and its vertical components, if the magnitude of the hypotenuse is capital F, then the magnitude of the adjacent side to this angle, this comes straight out of soh-cah-toa, from our right triangle trigonometry, it would be the magnitude of our hypotenuse times the cosine of this angle. And the magnitude of the vertical component, that would be the magnitude of our hypotenuse times the sine of that angle. And you could think about it the other way as well, if the force was like this, where it's just going in the opposite direction. But once again, you have this angle theta. And now the components would look like this, where the vertical component would have the same magnitude, but now it would be pointing downwards. And the horizontal component would have the same magnitude, but now it is pointing to the left. It is the same idea. If this force has magnitude F that's represented by the hypotenuse of this triangle, then the magnitude of our horizontal component is still going to be F cosine theta. The vector is not going in the other direction. And the magnitude of our vertical component here is going to be F sine theta. And so what about this scenario over here? Well, in this scenario, our vertical component is gonna look like this, and our horizontal component is going to look like this. And so what's the magnitude of our horizontal component? Well, it's going to be the magnitude of our hypotenuse times the cosine of the 60 degrees. So this is going to be 20 newtons times the cosine of 60 degrees. And it's really helpful, both trigonometry and physics classes, to know the values of your sines, your cosines, and your tangents at angles like zero degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 45 degrees. You could use a calculator here, but it's useful to know that the cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2. So 20 times 1/2, this is going to be equal to 10 newtons. And if we want to know the magnitude of our vertical component, well, this is going to be 20 newtons times the sine of 60 degrees. Once again, this is useful to know. It is square root of three over two. And so 20 divided by two is 10. So this is going to be 10 square root of three newtons. And so we can use that information. We've broken up our original vector into two component vectors that, if you took their sum, you would get your original one. But what's useful now is that we've broken it up into vectors that are parallel or perpendicular to our surface, which will allow us to think about what nets against these things that I already have in place. So let me draw that. So actually, I'll first draw this type of free-body diagram. So there is my block. And I have the force of gravity acting on it downwards. I will draw it right over here. So that's 10 newtons. That is the force of gravity acting downwards. Now, is that the only thing that I have acting downwards? No, I also have the vertical component of this applied force. And so this is going downwards 10 square roots of three newtons. And these aren't drawn perfectly to scale, but hopefully you get the idea. So this is 10 square roots of three newtons, just like that. And now what is our normal force, assuming that our surface is able to not be compressed in any way, that it is a hard, frictionless surface? Well, now our normal force is going to counteract both of these forces. Our normal force might look something like this. Once again, I haven't drawn it completely to scale. But this would be 10 plus 10 square roots of three newtons. And what about now in the horizontal direction? Well, I have this blue vector right here, and so that is going to the right with a magnitude of 10 newtons, 10 newtons. And so now you can hopefully appreciate why a free-body diagram is really, really, really useful. Just looking at this, I can predict what's going to happen to my block. I would say, look, this upward force is completely netted out by these downward forces, or these downward forces are completely netted out by this upward force. And the only net force that I have is ten newtons to the right. And so that lets me know that, hey, since I have a net force to the right, this block is going to accelerate to the right.",science_ap-physics-1_ap-forces-newtons-laws
" -  The following graph shows a proportional relationship. What is the constant of proportionality between y and x in the graph? Pause this video, and see if you can figure that out. All right, now let's do this together, and let's remind ourselves what a constant of proportionality even is. If we know that there is a proportional relationship between y and x, then there will be a constant of proportionality between these variables, and what this is, is it is a number that I would have to multiply x by to get to y. So I could make a little table here, as we often do when we describe proportional relationships, x and y. We know that when x is zero, y is zero. But if I multiply zero by anything, I'm gonna get zero. But then when x is one, what is y? When x is one, y is three. They mark it right over there. When x is two, what is y? X is two, we see that y is six. So our constant of proportionality is what are we multiplying x by to get to y? Well, let's see, to go from one to three, I have to multiply by three. To go from two to six, I have to multiply by three. Another way to think about it is we could write the equation y is equal to something times x. The number that we multiply x by to get y is our constant of proportionality. And we've seen, in all of these situations, this should be true for any point on this line. You give the x, you multiply it by three, you get your y. So the relationship here is y is equal to three x. So three is our constant of proportionality.",math_cc-seventh-grade-math_cc-7th-ratio-proportion
" Before we get into the meat of algebra, I wanted to give you a quote from one of the greatest minds in human history, Galileo Galilei, because I think this quote encapsulates the true point of algebra and really mathematics in general. He said, ""Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes-- I mean the universe-- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth."" So very dramatic, but very deep. And this really is the point of mathematics. And what we'll see as we start getting deeper and deeper into algebra is that we're going to start abstracting things, and we're going to start getting to core ideas that start explaining really how the universe is structured. Sure, these ideas can be applied to things like economics and fice and physics and chemistry. But at their core, they're the same idea, and so they're even more fundamental, more pure, than any one of those applications. And to see what I mean by getting down to the root idea, let's go with a-- I guess we started with the very grand, the philosophy of the universe is written in mathematics-- but let's start with a very concrete, simple idea. But we'll keep abstracting, and we'll see how the same idea connects across many domains in our universe. So let's just say we're at the store, and we're going to buy something. And there is a sale. The sale says that it is 30% percent off, and I'm interested. I don't shop at too fancy a store. So let's say I'm interested in a pair of pants. And the pair of pants before the sale even is about $20. And that is about how much I spend on my pants. So I'm interested in a $20 pair of pants. But it's even better, there's a 30% off sale on these pants. Well, how would I think about how much I'm going to get off of that $20? And this isn't algebra yet. This is something that you've probably had exposure to. You would multiply the 30% times the $20. So you would say your discount is equal to-- you could write it as 30% times $20. I'll do the $20 in purple. Or you could write it, if you wanted to write this as a decimal, you could write this as 0.30 times $20. And if you were to do the math, you would get $6. So nothing new over there. But what if I want to generalize it a little bit? That's the discount on this particular pair of pants. But what if I wanted to know the discount on anything in the store? Well, then I could say, well, let x be the price-- let me do this in a different color. So I'm just going to make a symbol. Let x be the price of the product I want to buy, price, the non-discount price of the product in the store. So now, all of a sudden, we can say that our discount is equal to 30% times x. Or if we wanted to write it as a decimal, if we wanted to write 30% as a decimal, we could write 0.30 times x. Now, this is interesting. Now you give me the price of any product in the store, and I can substitute it in for x. And then I can essentially multiply 0.3 times that, and I would get the discount. So now we're starting to, very slowly, we're starting to get into the abstraction of algebra. And we'll see that these will get much more nuanced and deep and, frankly, more beautiful as we start studying more and more kind of algebraic ideas. But we aren't done here. We can abstract this even more. Over here, we've said we've generalized this for any product. We're not just saying for this $20 product. If there's a $10 product, we can put that $10 product in here for x. And then we would say 0.30 times 10, and the discount would be $3. It might be $100 product, then the discount would be $30. But let's generalize even more. Let's say, well, what is the discount for any given sale when the sale is a certain percentage? So now we can say that the discount-- let me define a variable. So let's let m equal-- or I'll say p just so it makes sense. p is equal to the percentage off. Now what can we do? Well, now we can say that the discount is equal to the percentage off. In these other examples, we were picking 30%. But we can say now it's p. It's the percentage off. It's p. That's the percentage off times the product in question, times the price, the non-discount price of the product in question. Well, that was x. The discount is equal to p times x. Now, this is really interesting. Now we have a general way of calculating a discount for any given percentage off and any given product x. And we didn't have to use these words and these letters. We could have said let y equal the discount. Then we could have written the same underlying idea. Instead of writing discount, we could have written y is equal to the percentage off p times the non-discount price of the product, times x. And you could have defined these letters any way you wanted. Instead of writing y there, you could have written a Greek letter, or you could have written any symbol there. As long as you can keep track of it, that symbol represents the actual dollar discount. But now things get really interesting. Because we can use this type of a relationship, which is an equation-- you're equating y to this right over here, that's why we call it an equation-- this can be used for things that are completely unrelated to the price, the discount price, at the store over here. So in physics, you'll see that force is equal to mass times acceleration. The letters are different, but these are fundamentally the same idea. We could've let y is equal to force, and mass is equal to p. So let me write p is equal to mass. And this wouldn't be an intuitive way to define it, but I want to show you that this is the same idea, the same relationship, but it's being applied to two completely different things. And we could say x is equal to acceleration. Well, then the famous force is equal to mass times acceleration can be rewritten. And it's really the same exact idea as y, which we've defined as force, can be equal to mass, which we're going to use the symbol p, which is equal to p times acceleration. And we're just going to happen to use the letter x here, times x. Well, this is the exact same equation. This is the exact same equation. And we could see that we can take this equation, and it can apply to things in economics, or it can apply to things in fice, or it can apply to things in computer science, or logic, or electrical engineering, or anything, accounting. There's an infinite number of applications of this one equation. And what's neat about mathematics and what's neat about algebra in particular is we can focus on this abstraction. We can focus on the abstract here, and we can manipulate the abstract here. And what we discover from these ideas, from these manipulations, can then go and be reapplied to all of these other applications, to all of them. And even neater, it's kind of telling us the true structure of the universe if you were to strip away all of these human definitions and all of these human applications. So for example, we could say, look, if y is equal to p times x-- so literally, if someone said, hey, this is y, and someone says, on the other hand, I have p times x, I could say, well, you have the same thing in both of your hands. And if you were to divide one of them by a number, and if you wanted them to still be equal, you would divide the other one by that number. So for example, we know that y is equal to p times x. Well, what if you wanted to have them both be equal? And you say, well, what is y divided by x going to be equal to? Well, y was equal to p times x, so y divided by x is going to be the same thing as p times x divided by x. But now this is interesting. Because p times x divided by x-- well, if you multiply by something and then divide by that something, it's just you're going to get your original number. If you multiply by 5 and divide by 5, you're just going to start with p or whatever this number is. So those would cancel out. But we were able to manipulate the abstraction here and get y over x is equal to p-- and let me make that x green. And now this has implications for every one of these ideas. One is telling us a fundamental truth about the universe, almost devoid of any of these applications. But now we can go and take them back to any place that we applied. And the really interesting thing is we're going to find there are an infinite number of applications, and we don't even know, frankly, most of them. We're going to discover new ones for them in a thousand years. And so hopefully this gives you a sense for why Galileo said what he said about really mathematics is really the language with which we can understand the philosophy of the universe. And that's why people tell us that if a completely alien life form were to ever contact humans, mathematics would probably be our first common ground, 1the place that we can start to form a basis that we 1can start to communicate from.",math_algebra_foundation-algebra
" In the last video, we saw the classification of elements into groups on the periodic table, and we stopped with the definition for a transition metal. There are two ways to think about transition metals. So one way to think about it would be when some teachers say transition metal, they're talking about elements found from Groups 3 through Group 12. So all the elements in here, some people consider these to be the transition metals. So these are the elements found in the d block, right? So we're talking about d orbitals here. So you have to understand electron configurations for this video. So that's one way to think about the transition metals, but that way is maybe a little bit too general sometimes. So there is another definition, which you'll find in the IUPAC website. IUPAC is an acronym for International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, and they say that a transition element refers to an element whose atom has an incomplete d subshell. So when you're talking about the d orbitals, we already know there are five d orbitals, and each orbital holds a maximum of two electrons. So 5 times 2 is 10. So 10 will be the maximum number of electrons that you could fit in your d orbitals, or your d subshells. So let's count that out on our periodic table so 10, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 for our d block. So let's go ahead and write an electron configuration for a transition metal and let's see how that applies to our definition from IUPAC. So let's write an electron configuration for iron. So here's iron right here. And if I wanted to write an electron configuration, let's say I wanted to do noble gas notation. So once again, I'm assuming that you know how to do this already so I won't spend too much time talking about it. But if I want to write a noble gas configuration, I would go to argon, which is the noble gas before iron, and I would put argon in brackets like that. And that takes me to the fourth energy level or the fourth period on the periodic table. And then just looking at the periodic table, I can say, oh, that would be 4s1, 4s2, so I can write 4s2 here. And then I'm in my d orbitals. So, again, just looking at the periodic table to write my electron configuration, I would say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 electrons. So that would be 3d6. And I could have written this 3d6 4s2. And right now, both are considered to be correct answers. And I won't get into a discussion about the order of filling of these orbitals in this videos. So I'll save that for another video. This video is only talking about definitions and identifying elements on the periodic table. And so either one of these would be a correct electron configuration. And when I look at the d orbitals for the electron configuration, I can see that there are six electrons in my d orbitals. Well, that's an incomplete d subshell, because I can fit a total of 10 into my d orbitals. And so iron would be an example of an element whose atom has an incomplete d subshell. So iron is a transition metal. Let's write the electron configuration for zinc. So let's find zinc over here, so right there on pour periodic table. So if I wanted to write the electron configuration for zinc, once again, I would go to the noble gas before it, which is argon. So I would put in brackets argon right here. And then, once again, it takes me to the fourth energy level. So 4s1, 4s2, so 4s2. And then I count over for my d electrons-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. So it would be 3d10. And once again, I could have written that argon in brackets 3d10 4s2. So it doesn't matter. So let's think about the definition for a transition metal, an element whose atom has an incomplete d subshell. Well, if I look at the d orbitals for zinc, they are completely full. I have 10 electrons in my d orbital, and so this is a complete d subshell. So this does not meet the definition for a transition element. Now, also in the definition, it talks about cations. So let's think about to the cation that zinc would form. Zinc would go to zinc 2 plus. So if I wanted to write the electron configuration for zinc 2 plus, I need to think about where does zinc lose two electrons? So if you've going from a neutral atom of zinc to zinc 2 plus, you would have to lose two electrons. Well, I already know that those two electrons are going to be lost from the 4s orbitals. So we're going to lose these two electrons right here on your electron configuration, and so you'd be left with 3d10. And once again, you have a cation that has a complete d subshell. You've completely filled your d orbitals, and so the cation does not have an incomplete d subshell, which means that it doesn't fit our technical definition for a transition element from IUPAC. And so, once again, there are two ways of thinking about it. One's a very general way. So you might hear someone talk about an element from Groups 3 through to 12 as being a transition metal, or you might find people who are a little bit more particular about the definition, who go along with IUPAC. It's good to be aware of both ways of thinking about it.",science_chemistry_periodic-table
"  I want to do a quick follow-up to the last video because I did not give a complete picture of all of the fiscal policy tools that a government has at its disposal. What I focused on in the last video is a government that holds taxes constant, taxes constant, and increases spending. Spending goes up. The only way that a government could do that is by taking on more debt, or I guess if there are some governments that are saving, saving less, but most of them, they're going to have to take on more debt. So they're going to take on more debt. Just to think about it in terms of the, in terms of the GDP expenditure components, we know that GDP, GDP is equal to consumption, which is mostly consumers, individuals, investment, which is mostly firms, and some consumer spending on new houses. Then you have government expenditure, and then you have net exports, which kind of completes the picture. But what we described in the last video is these two things are held constant. Taxes don't change. People, the government isn't fueling its expenditures with more taxes, so this part stays constant, but with the extra debt, the government spends more, so this part goes up, everything else holds roughly constant, and so GDP would go up. The other tool that the government has, has at its disposal, is to hold spending constant, so spending is held constant, and lowering taxes, and lowering taxes, which would essentially put more money in the hands of consumers of individuals, families, and firms. Once again, the only way they can do that, if you hold spending constant, and you're reducing your revenues, the only way they can do that is once again, taking on more debt. This is a common theme here. They would have to take on more debt, assuming they don't have any savings to kind of eat up, to fice this type of thing. Looking at this again, we have GDP is equal to consumption plus investment plus government spending plus net exports, plus net exports, in this situation, government spending is held constant but because the consumers' and the firms' taxes have gone down, they have more to spend, and they will spend some component of it, and so these two pieces will go up, and GDP will go up. I just wanted to make sure we added this picture right over here. Fiscal policy isn't just about increasing or decreasing government spending. It can also be about tax policy, increasing or decreasing taxes.",economics-finance-domain_macroeconomics_aggregate-supply-demand-topic
" -  What we see here is an economy with an output gap. As you can see, the short run equilibrium output is below our full employment output. This is sometimes referred to as a recessionary output gap. And in other videos, we talk about how there could be a self-adjustment mechanism in the long run, that because we are below full employment, folks who maybe, especially folks who wanna get a job, might say, ""Hey, I'm willing to work for less and less."" And maybe our short run aggregate supply curve shifts down over time and we get to a state, something like this, and in that case, so this would be our short run aggregate supply curve two, and in that case, all of a sudden, we would be in a long run equilibrium where our equilibrium output is equal to our full employment output. But let's say that does not happen. Let's say we are in a world where, for some reason, we stay sticky with this negative output gap and you are the government and you wanna do something about it. You wanna get back to full employment output. Well, there's a couple of levers. You have fiscal policy, fiscal policy, which is all about changing how much you spend, so this would be government spending. Let me make it clear. This is government spending. Or changing the amount of taxation. So, the theory is if the government spends more, that would increase total output and then the other theory is if the government taxes less, there's more money out in the economy and that could also increase total output. And there's also monetary policy, which we're not gonna go into detail in this video, but monetary policy is messing with the money supply. If maybe there's more money out there, lower interest rates, it might increase output, and then the opposite could be true the other way. But we are going to, so let me just write this. This is the money supply. Money supply/interest rates. Interest rates. And this would be the business of a central bank. But we are going to focus on fiscal policy. So as a government, what we want to see happen is this aggregate demand curve shift to the right, so we want it to get to a place like this. We want our aggregate demand curve to shift to the right just like this, so this would be aggregate demand two. And how do we do that? How do we get this shift right over here so that we get to our full employment output? Well, there's two levers that we can think about. As we just said, government spending and taxation. Now, a big misconception is a lot of folks say, ""Well, if I increase spending by a hundred billion dollars, ""that's equivalent of reducing taxes ""by a hundred billion dollars ""because there would be a hundred billion more dollars ""out there in the economy to increase output."" But you have to be very careful. Remember what we learned about multipliers, and remember, these are all very simple models, but a regular multiplier, let me write it over here, a regular multiplier, a regular multiplier is one over one minus the marginal propensity to consume, while our tax multiplier, tax multiplier is equal to, so if you have an increase in taxes, that would be the negative of the marginal propensity to consume over one minus the marginal propensity to consume. The negative would be if you increase taxes that is going to have a negative total effect on spending. And the reason why you have this marginal propensity to consume in the numerator is if I were to have my taxes reduced by, say, a hundred dollars, depending on my marginal propensity to consume, if my marginal propensity to consume is less than one, which it typically is, I'm not gonna spend all that hundred dollars. I am going to spend some fraction of it, really the marginal propensity to consume times a hundred dollars. While if the government just goes out there and spends a hundred dollars, well, that hundred dollars got spent. And to see the impact, the difference in impact, let's go through it a little bit, let's do an example. Let's say a situation where the government, the government just spends $100 billion. So, the government wants to spend $100 billion. What is going to be the impact? And let's say we're in a world where our marginal propensity to consume is equal to 0.8. What is going to be the effect on the economy in this situation right over here? Well, in this situation, you're going to have a hundred billion dollars of spending times, you're gonna multiply it times the multiplier, one over one minus our marginal propensity to consume, 0.8, and so this is going to be equal to $100 billion, $100 billion divided by 0.2. Well, 0.2 is 1/5, so this is going to be the same thing as dividing by 1/5 or multiplying by five, so you're going to have an increase in output based on this very simple model of $500 billion. So, our multiplier here was five. But let's say we go the other way, let's say instead, the government decides to decrease taxes by a hundred billion dollars. So, decrease taxes by $100 billion, and we're gonna assume the exact same marginal propensity to consume. Well, in that situation, what's our tax multiplier? And we're decreasing taxes, so that will offset this negative. So, the increase in the economy is going to be our hundred billion dollars times our marginal propensity to consume, 0.8, divided by one minus the marginal propensity to consume. Well, this part right over here was exactly the same as what we had over there, so that's going to be equal to $500 billion, this part, times 0.8. And so, what is that going to be? Well, that is going to be equal to $400 billion. And once again, intuitively, where did this come from? Well, if the government spends that hundred billion dollars, that hundred billion dollars gets spent and then you have the marginal propensity to consume, the person or the people who get it will then spend 80 billion of that, and then the people who'd get that would spend 64 billion, on and on and on, so it eventually ends up being $500 billion. But with the decrease in taxes of a hundred billion, that first hundred billion doesn't necessarily get spent. If I get my taxes reduced, let's say they're all on me, by a hundred billion, I might save some of it based on this marginal propensity to consume. I might save 20 billion of it and spend the other 80 billion, and so that's why based on this simplified model, you might have a lower total impact right over here. So, that's a very important takeaway. Fiscal policy, government spending or taxation, but based on these models, you would use a different multiplier, and so they are not going to be necessarily equivalent.",economics-finance-domain_ap-macroeconomics_national-income-and-price-determinations
" - Scarlett and Hansol's teacher gave them a system of linear equations to solve. They each took a few steps that lead to the systems shown in the table below. So this is the teacher system. This is what Scarlett got after taking some steps. This is what Hansol got. Which of them obtained a system that is equivalent to the teacher's system? And just to remind ourselves, an equivalent system is a system that has, or at least for our purposes, is a system that has the same solution, or the same solution set. So if there is a certain xy that satisfies this system in order for Scarlett's system to be equivalent it needs to have the same solution. So let's look at this. So Scarlett, let's see, let's see if we can match these up. So her second equation here, so this is interesting, her second equation 14x - 7y = 2 over here the teacher has an equation 14x - 7y = 7. So this is interesting because the ratio between x and y is the same, but then your constant term, the constant term is going to be different. And I would make the claim that this alone tells you that Scarlett's system is not equivalent to the teacher. And you're saying, well, how can I say that? Well, these two equations if you were to write them into slope intercept form, you would see because the ratio between x and y, the x and y terms is the same. You're going to have the same slope, but you're going to have different Y intercepts. In fact, we can actually solve for that. So this equation right over here we can write it as if we, let's see, if we subtract 14x from both sides you get -7y - 14, woops, -7y =, is equal to -14x + 7 and we could divide both sides by -7. You get y = 2x -1 so that's this... All I did is algebraically manipulate this. This is this line and I could even try to graph it so let's do that. So I'll draw a quick coordinate. This is just going to be very rough. Quick coordinate axis right over there, and then this line, this line would look something like this. So its y intercept is -1 and it has a slope of 2. So let me draw a line with a slope of, a line with a slope of 2 might look something like that. So that's this line right over here or this one right over there, and let's see. This one over here is going to be, if we do the same algebra, we're going to have - 7y = -14x + 2, or y = , I'm just dividing everything by -7, 2x - 2/7 so this is going to look something like this. Its y intercept is -2/7 so it's like right over there. So this line is going to look something like, I'm going to draw my best, my best attempt at drawing it, it's going to look something... Actually that's not quite right. It's going to look something like... I'll actually just start it right over here. It's going to look something like, something like this. It's going to have the same slope, and obviously it goes in this direction as well. Actually, let me just draw that. So it's going to have the same slope, but at different y intercepts. That doesn't look right, but you get the idea. These two lines are parallel. So these two lines are parallel so any coordinate that satisfies this one is not going to satisfy this one. They have no points in common. They are parallel. That's the definition of parallel. Since this and this have no points in common, there's no way that some solution set that satisfies this would satisfy this 'cause any xy that satisfies this can't satisfy this or vice versa. They're parallel. There are no points. These two things will never intersect. So Scarlett does not have an equivalent system. Now what about Hansol? Well, we see Hansol has the same thing going on here. 5x - y, 5x - y, but then the constant term is different, -6, positive 3. So this and this also represent parallel lines. Any xy pair that satisfies this, there's no way that it's going to satisfy this. These two lines don't intersect. They are parallel. So Hansol's system is not equivalent either.",math_math1_systems
" In this video I'm going to do a bunch of example slope problems. Just as a bit of review, slope is just a way of measuring the inclination of a line. And the definition-- we're going to hopefully get a good working knowledge of it in this video-- the definition of it is a change in y divided by change in x. This may or may not make some sense to you right now, but as we do more and more examples, I think it'll make a good amount of sense. Let's do this first line right here. Line a. Let's figure out its slope. They've actually drawn two points here that we can use as the reference points. So first of all, let's look at the coordinates of those points. So you have this point right here. What's its coordinates? Its x-coordinate is 3. Its y-coordinate is 6. And then down here, this point's x-coordinate is negative 1 and its y-coordinate is negative 6. So there's a couple of ways we can think about slope. One is, we could look at it straight up using the formula. We could say change in y-- so slope is change in y over change in x. We can figure it out numerically. I'll in a second draw it graphically. So what's our change in y? Our change in y is literally how much did our y values change going from this point to that point? So how much did our y values change? Our y went from here, y is at negative 6 and it went all the way up to positive 6. So what's this distance right here? It's going to be your end point y value. It's going to be 6 minus your starting point y value. Minus negative 6 or 6 plus 6, which is equal to 12. You could just count this. You say one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. So when we changed our y value by 12, we had to change our x value by-- what was our change it x over the same change in y? Well we went from x is equal to negative 1 to x is equal to 3. Right? x went from negative 1 to 3. So we do the end point, which is 3 minus the starting point, which is negative 1, which is equal to 4. So our change in y over change in x is equal to 12/4 or if we want to write this in simplest form, this is the same thing as 3. Now the interpretation of this means that for every 1 we move over-- we could view this, let me write it this way. Change in y over change in x is equal to-- we could say it's 3 or we could say it's 3/1. Which tells us that for every 1 we move in the positive x-direction, we're going to move up 3 because this is a positive 3 in the y-direction. You can see that. When we moved 1 in the x, we moved up 3 in the y. When we moved 1 in the x, we moved up 3 in the y. If you move 2 in the x-direction, you're going to move 6 in the y. 6/2 is the same thing as 3. So this 3 tells us how quickly do we go up as we increase x. Let's do the same thing for the second line on this graph. Graph b. Same idea. I'm going to use the points that they gave us. But really you could use any points on that line. So let's see, we have one point here, which is the point 0, 1. You have 0, 1. And then the starting point-- we could call this the finish point-- the starting point right here, we could view it as x is negative 6 and y is negative 2. So same idea. What is the change in y given some change in x? So let's do the change in x first. So what is our change in x? So in this situation, what is our change in x? delta x. We could even count it. It's one, two, three, four, five, six. It's going to be 6. But if you didn't have a graph to count from, you could literally take your finishing x-position, so it's 0, and subtract from that your starting x-position. 0 minus negative 6. So when your change in x is equal to-- so this will be 6-- what is our change in y? Remember we're taking this as our finishing position. This is our starting position. So we took 0 minus negative 6. So then on the y, we have to do 1 minus negative 2. What's 1 minus negative 2? That's the same thing as 1 plus 2. That is equal to 3. So it is 3/6 or 1/2. So notice, when we moved in the x-direction by 6, we moved in the y-direction by positive 3. So our change in y was 3 when our change in x was 6. Now, one of the things that confuses a lot of people is how do I know what order to-- how did I know to do the 0 first and the negative 6 second and then the 1 first and then the negative 2 second. And the answer is you could've done it in either order as long as you keep them straight. So you could have also have done change in y over change in x. We could have said, it's equal to negative 2 minus 1. So we're using this coordinate first. Negative 2 minus 1 for the y over negative 6 minus 0. Notice this is a negative of that. That is the negative of that. But since we have a negative over negative, they're going to cancel out. So this is going to be equal to negative 3 over negative 6. The negatives cancel out. This is also equal to 1/2. So the important thing is if you use this y-coordinate first, then you have to use this x-coordinate first as well. If you use this y-coordinate first, as we did here, then you have to use this x-coordinate first, as you did there. You just have to make sure that your change in x and change in y are-- you're using the same final and starting points. Just to interpret this, this is saying that for every minus 6 we go in x. So if we go minus 6 in x, so that's going backwards, we're going to go minus 3 in y. But they're essentially saying the same thing. The slope of this line is 1/2. Which tells us for every 2 we travel in x, we go up 1 in y. Or if we go back 2 in x, we go down 1 in y. That's what 1/2 slope tells us. Notice, the line with the 1/2 slope, it is less steep than the line with a slope of 3. Let's do a couple more of these. Let's do line c right here. I'll do it in pink. Let's say that the starting point-- I'm just picking this arbitrarily. Well, I'm using these points that they've drawn here. The starting point is at the coordinate negative 1, 6 and that my finishing point is at the point 5, negative 6. Our slope is going to be-- let me write this-- slope is going to be equal to change in x-- sorry, change in y. I'll never forget that. Change in y over change in x. Sometimes it's said rise over run. Run is how much you're moving in the horizontal direction. Rise is how much you're moving in the vertical direction. Then we could say our change in y is our finishing y-point minus our starting y-point. This is our finishing y-point. That's our starting y-point, over our finishing x-point minus our starting x-point. If that confuses you, all I'm saying is, it's going to be equal to our finishing y-point is negative 6 minus our starting y-point, which is 6, over our finishing x-point, which is 5, minus our starting x-point, which is negative 1. So this is equal to negative 6 minus 6 is negative 12. 5 minus negative 1. That is 6. So negative 12/6. That's the same thing as negative 2. Notice we have a negative slope here. That's because every time we increase x by 1, we go down in the y-direction. So this is a downward sloping line. It's going from the top left to the bottom right. As x increases, the y decreases. And that's why we got a negative slope. This line over here should have a positive slope. Let's verify it. So I'll use the same points that they use right over there. So this is line d. Slope is equal to rise over run. How much do we rise when we go from that point to that point? Let's see. We could do it this way. We are rising-- I could just count it out. We are rising one, two, three, four, five, six. We are rising 6. How much are we running? We are running-- I'll do it in a different color. We're running one, two, three, four, five, six. We're running 6. So our slope is 6/6, which is 1. Which tells us that every time we move 1 in the x-direction-- positive 1 in the x-direction-- we go positive 1 in the y-direction. For every x, if we go negative 2 in the x-direction, we're going to go negative 2 in the y-direction. 1So whatever we do in x, we're going to do the same thing in 1y in this slope. 1Notice, that was pretty easy. 1If we wanted to do it mathematically, we could 1figure out this coordinate right there. 1That we could view as our starting position. 1Our starting position is negative 2, negative 4. 1Our finishing position is 4, 2. 1So our slope, change in y over change in x. 1I'll take this point 2 minus negative 4 over 4 minus 1negative 2. 12 minus negative 4 is 6. 1Remember that was just this distance right there. 1Then 4 minus negative 2, that's also 6. 1That's that distance right there. 1We get a slope of 1. 1Let's do another one. 1Let's do another couple. 1These are interesting. 1Let's do the line e right here. 1Change in y over change in x. 1So our change in y, when we go from this point to this 1point-- I'll just count it out. 1It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. 1It's 8. 1Or you could even take this y-coordinate 2 minus negative 16 will give you that distance, 8. 1What's the change in y? 1Well the y-value here is-- oh sorry what's the change in x? 1The x-value here is 4. 1The x-value there is 4. 1X does not change. 1So it's 8/0. 1Well, we don't know. 18/0 is undefined. 1So in this situation the slope is undefined. 1When you have a vertical line, you say 1your slope is undefined. 1Because you're dividing by 0. 1But that tells you that you're dealing probably with a 1vertical line. 1Now finally let's just do this one. 1This seems like a pretty straight up vanilla slope 1problem right there. 1You have that point right there, which is 1the point 3, 1. 1So this is line f. 1You have the point 3, 1. 1Then over here you have the point negative 6, negative 2. 1So our slope would be equal to change in y. 1I'll take this as our ending point, just so you can go in 1different directions. 1So our change in y-- now we're going to go 1down in that direction. 1So it's negative 2 minus 1. 1That's what this distance is right here. 1Negative 2 minus 1, which is equal to negative 3. 1Notice we went down 3. 1And then what is going to be our change in x? 1Well, we're going to go back that amount. 1What is that amount? 1Well, that is going to be negative 6, that's our end 1point, minus 3. 1That gives us that distance, which is negative 9. 1For every time we go back 9, we're going to go down 3. 1Which is the same thing as if we go forward 9, we're going 1to go up 3. 1All equivalent. 1And we see these cancel out and you get a slope of 1/3. 1Positive 1/3. 1It's an upward sloping line. 1Every time we run 3, we rise 1. 1Anyway, hopefully that was a good review of slope for you.",math_algebra-basics_alg-basics-graphing-lines-and-slope
" Is 3 comma negative 4 a solution to the equation 5x plus 2y is equal to 7? So there's two ways to think about it. One, you could just substitute this x and y value into this equation to see if it satisfies-- and then we'll do that way first-- and the other way is if you had a graph of this equation, you could see if this point sits on that graph, which would also mean that it is a solution to this equation. So let's do it the first way. So we have 5x plus 2y is equal to 7, so let's substitute. Instead of x, let us put in 3 for x. So 5 times 3 plus 2 times y-- so y is negative 4-- plus 2 times negative 4 needs to be equal to 7. I'll put a question mark here, because we're not sure yet if it does. So 5 times 3 is 15, and then 2 times negative 4 is negative 8. So the left hand side, it simplifies to 15 minus 8, and this needs to be equal to 7. And of course, 15 minus 8 does equal 7, so this all works out. This is a solution, so we've answered the question. But I also want to show you, this way we just did it by substitution. If we had the graph of this equation, we could also do it graphically. So let's give ourselves the graph of this equation, and I'll do that by setting up a table. There's multiple ways to graph this. You could put it in a slope-intercept form and all of the rest, but I'll just set up a table of x and y values. And I'll graph it, and then given the graph, I want to see if this actually sits on it. And obviously it will, because we've already shown that this works. In fact, we could try the point 3, negative 4, and that actually is on the graph. We could do it on our table, but I won't do that just yet. I'm just going to do this to give ourselves a graph. So let's try it when x is equal to 0. We have 5 times 0 plus 2 times y is equal to 7. So when x is equal to 0, y is going to be-- so you're going to have 0 plus 2y is equal to 7. y is going to be equal to 3.5. When x is equal to 1, you have 5 plus 2y is equal to 7. If you subtract 5 from both sides, you get 2y is equal to 2. You get y is equal to 1. So when x is 1, y is 1, and when x is-- well let's try-- well that's actually enough for us to graph. We could keep doing more points. We could even put the point 3, negative 4 there, but let's just try to graph it in this very rough sense right here. So let me draw my x-axis, and then this right over here is my y-axis. And let me draw some points here. So let's say that this is y is 1, 2, 3, 4. This is negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4. I could keep going down in that direction. This is 1. Let me do it a little bit-- 1, 2, 3, 4, and I could just keep going on and on in the positive x direction. So let's plot these points. I have 0, 3.5. When x is 0, y is 1, 2, 3.5. When x is 1, y is 1. And so if we were to draw this line-- I'll do it as a dotted line, just so that I can make sure I connect the dots. I can do a better job than that though. So it will look something like that. And so if someone gave you this line, you'd say oh, well it's 3, negative 4 on this line, and let's assume that we drew it really nicely and this was all to scale. Let me try one last attempt at it. So it's going to look something like that. And If someone asked is 3, negative 4 on it, you could visually do it, but it's always hard when you actually don't substitute it, because you don't know. Maybe you're a little bit off. But if you look at it over here, you say when x is equal to 3, what is y? Well, you go down here, and it looks like y is equal to negative 4. So this is a point 3 comma negative 4. Obviously, in general, you don't want to just rely off of inspecting graphs. Maybe this was 3, negative 3.9999, and you just couldn't tell looking at the graph. That's why you always want to just the substitute and make sure that it really does equal, that this equality really does hold true at that point, not just looking at the graph. But it's important to realize that the graph really is another representation to all of the solutions of this equation.",math_algebra-home_alg-linear-eq-func
" I think we have a respectable sense of how muscles contract on the molecular level. Let's take a step back now and just understand how muscles look, at least structurally, or how they relate to things that we normally associate with muscles. So let me draw a flexing bicep right here. That's their elbow and let's say that's their hand right there. So this is their bicep and it's flexing. I think we've all seen diagrams of what muscles look, at least on kind of a macro level and it's connected to the bones at either end. Let me draw the bones. I'm not going to detail where-- so it's connected to the bones at either end by tendons. So this right here would be some bone. Right there would be another bone that it's connected to. And then this is tendons, which connects the bones to the muscles. We have the general sense-- connected to two bones, when it contracts it moves some part of our skeletal system. So we're actually focused on skeletal muscles. The other types are smooth muscles and cardiac muscles. Cardiac muscles are those, as you can imagine, in our heart. And smooth muscles are-- these are more involuntary, slow moving muscles and things like our digestive tract. And I'll do video on that in the future, but most of the time when people say muscles, we associate them with skeletal muscles that move our skeletal system around, allow us to run and lift and talk and do and bite things. So this is what we normally associate-- let's dig in a little bit deeper here. So if I were to take a cross section of this bicep right there-- if I were to take a cross section of that muscle right there-- so let me do it big. And then it looks something like this. This is the inside of this muscle over here. Now I said back here, we had our tendon. And then there's actually a covering; there's no strict demarcation or dividing line between the tendon and the covering around this muscle, but that covering is called the epimysium and it's really just connective tissue that covers the muscle, kind of protects it, reduces friction between the muscle and the surrounding bone and other tissue that might be in this person's arm right there. And then within this muscle, you have connective tissue on the inside. Let me do it in another color. I'll do it in orange. This is called a perimyseum, and that's also just connective tissue inside of the actual muscle. And then each of these things that the perimysium is dividing off-- let me say if we were to take one of these things and allow it to go a little bit further-- so if we were to take this thing right here-- what this perimysium is dividing off-- and if we were to pull it out-- actually, let me do this one right here. If we were to pull this one out just like that-- so you have the perimysium surrounding it, right? This is all perimysium, and it's just a fancy word for connective tissue. There's other stuff in there. You could have nerves and you could have capillaries, all sorts of stuff because you have to get blood and neuronal signals to your muscles of entry so it's not just connective tissue. It's other things that have to be able to eventually get to your muscle cells. So each of these-- I guess you'd call it subfibers, but these are pretty big subfibers of the muscle. This is called a fascicle. The connective tissue inside of the fascicle is called the endomysium. So once again, more connective tissues, has capillaries in it, has nerves in it, all of the things that have to eventually come in contact with muscle cells. We're inside of a single muscle. All this green connective tissue is endomysium. And each of these things that are in the endomysium are an actual muscle cell. This is an actual muscle cell. I'll do it in purple. So this thing right here-- I can pull it out a little bit. If I pull this out, this is an actual muscle cell. This is what we wanted to get to, but we're going to go even within the muscle cell to see, understand how all the myosin and the actin filaments fit into that muscle cell. So this right here is a muscle cell or a myofiber. The two prefixes you'll see a lot when dealing with muscles-- you're going to see myo, which you can imagine refers to muscle. And you're also going to see the word sarco, like sarcolemma, or sarcoplasmic reticulum. So you're also go see the prefix sarco and that's flesh-- so sarcophagus-- or you can think of other things that start with sarco. So sarco is flesh. Muscle is flesh and myo is muscle. So this is myofiber. This is an actual muscle cell and so let's zoom in on the actual muscle. So let me actually draw it really a lot bigger here. So an actual muscle cell is called a myofiber. It's called a fiber because it's longer than it is wide and they come in various-- let me draw the myofiber like this. I'll take a cross section of the muscle cell as well. And these can be relatively short-- several hundred micrometers-- or it could be quite long-- at least quite long by cellular standards. We're talking several centimeters. Think of it as a cell. That's quite a long cell. Because it's so long, it actually has to have multiple nucleuses. Actually, to draw the nucleuses, let me do a better job drawing the myofiber. I'm going to make little lumps in the outside membranes where the nucleuses can fit on this myofiber. Remember, this is just one of these individual muscle cells and they're really long so they have multiple nucleuses. Let me take its cross section because we're going to go inside of this muscle cell. So I said it's multinucleated. So if we kind of imagine its membrane being transparent, there'd be one nucleus over here, another nucleus over here, another nucleus over here, another nucleus over there. And the reason why it's multinucleated is so that over large distances, you don't have to wait for proteins to get all the way from this nucleus all the way over to this part of the muscle cell. You can actually have the DNA information close to where it needs to be. So it's multinucleated. I read one-- I think it was 30 or so nucleuses per millimeter of muscle tissue is what the average is. I don't know if that's actually the case, but the nucleuses are kind of right under the membrane of the muscle cell-- and you remember what that's called from the last video. The membrane of the muscle cell is the sarcolemma. These are the nucleuses. And then if you take the cross section of that, there are tubes within that called myofibrils. So here there's a bunch of tubes inside of the actual cell. Let me pull one of them out. So I've pulled out one of these tubes. This is a myofibril. And if you were to look at this under a light microscope, you'll see it has little striations on it. the striations will look something like that, like that, like that, and there'll be little thin ones like that, like that. And inside of these myofibrils is where we'll find our myosin and actin filaments. So let's zoom in over here on this myofibril. We'll just keep zooming until we get to the molecular level. So this myofibril, which is-- remember, it's inside of the muscle cell, inside of the myofiber. The myofiber is a muscle cell. Myofibral is a-- you can view it as a tube inside of the muscle cell. These are the things that are actually doing the contraction. So if I were to zoom in on a myofibril, you're going to see it-- it's going to look something like that and it's going to have those bands in it. So the bands are going to look something like this. 1You're going to have these short bands like that. 1Then you're going to have wider bands like that, like 1these little dark-- trying my best to draw them relatively 1neatly and there could be a little line right there. 1Then the same thing repeats over here. 1So each of these units of 1repetition is called a sarcomere. 1And these units of repetition go from one-- this is called a 1Z-line to another Z-line. 1And all of this terminology comes out of when people just 1looked under a microscope and they saw these lines, they 1started attaching names to it. 1And just so you have the other terminology-- we'll talk about 1how this relates to the myosin and the actin in a second. 1This right here is the A-band. 1And then this distance right here or these parts right 1here, these are called the I-bands. 1And we'll talk about really in a few seconds how that relates 1to the mechanisms or the units that we talked-- or the 1molecules that we talked about in the last video. 1So if you were to zoom in here, if you were to go into 1these myofibrils, if you were to take a cross section of 1these myofibrils, what you'll find is-- if you were to cut 1it up, maybe slice it-- if you were slice it parallel to the 1actual screen that you're looking at, you're going to 1see something like this. 1So this is going to be your Z-band. 1This is your next Z-band. 1So I'm zooming in on sarcomere now. 1This is another Z-band. 1Then you have your actin filaments. 1Now we're getting to that molecular level 1that I talked about. 1And then in between the actin filaments, you have your 1myosin filaments. 1Remember, the myosin filaments had those two heads on them. 1They each have two heads like that, that crawl along the 1actin filaments. 1I'm just drawing a couple of them and then they're attached 1at the middle just like that. 1We'll talk about in a second what happens when the muscle 1actually contracts. 1And I could draw it again over here. 1So it has many more heads than what I'm drawing, but this 1just gives you an idea of what's happening. 1These are the myosin, I guess, proteins and they all 1intertwined like we saw in the previous video and then 1there'll be another one over here. 1I don't have to draw in detail. 1So you can see immediately that the A-band corresponds to 1where we have our myosin. 1So this is our A-band right here. 1And there is an overlap. 1They do overlap each other, even in the resting state, but 1the I-band is where you only have actin 1filaments, no myosin. 1And then the myosin filaments are held in place by titin, 1which you can kind of imagine as a springy protein. 1I want to do it in a different color than that. 1So the myosin is held in place by titin. 1It's attached to the Z-band by titin. 1So what happened? 1So we have all of these-- when a neuron excites-- so let me 1draw an endpoint of a neuron right here, the endpoint of an 1axon of a neuron right there. 1It's a motor neuron. 1It's telling this guy to contract. 1You have the action potential. 1The action potential travels along the membrane, really in 1all directions. 1And then it eventually, if we look at it from this view, 1they have those little transverse or T-tubules. 1They essentially go into the cell and continue to propagate 1the action potential. 1Those trigger the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium. 1The calcium attaches to the troponin that's attached to 1these actin filaments that moves the tropomyosin out of 1the way, and then the crawling can occur. 1The myosin can start using ATP to crawl 1along these actin filaments. 1And so as you can imagine, as they crawl along, their power 1stroke is going to push-- you can either view it as the 1actin filaments in that way or you can say that the myosin is 1going to want to move in that direction, but you're pulling 1on both sides of a rope, right? 1So the myosin is going to stay in one place and the actin 1filaments are going to be pulled together. 1And that's essentially how the muscle is contracting. 1So we've, hopefully, in this video, connected the big 1picture from the flexing muscle all the way over here 1to exactly what's happening at the molecular level that we 1learned in the last few videos. 1And you can imagine, when this happens to all of the 1myofibrils inside of the muscle, right, because the 1sarcoplasmic reticulum's releasing calcium generally 1into the cytoplasm of-- which is also called myoplasm, 1because we're dealing with muscle cells-- the cytoplasm 1of this muscle cell. 1The calcium floods all of these myofibrils. 1It's able to attach to all of the troponin-- or at least a 1lot of the troponin on top of these actin filaments and then 1the whole muscle contracts. 1And then when that's done, each muscle fiber, myofiber, 1or each muscle cell will not have that 1much contracting power. 1But when you couple it with all of them that are around 1it-- if you just have one, actually, working, or a few of 1them, you'll just have a twitch. 1But if you have all of them contracting together, then 1that's actually going to create the force to actually 1do some work, or actually pull your bones together, or lift 1some weights. 1So hopefully you found that mildly useful.",science_biology_human-biology
"  What I want to do in this video is prove to you that the square root of 2 is irrational. And I'm going to do this through a proof by contradiction. And the proof by contradiction is set up by assuming the opposite. So this is our goal, but for the sake of our proof, let's assume the opposite. Let's assume that square root of 2 is rational. And then we'll see if we lead to a contradiction, that this actually cannot be the case. And if it cannot be the case that is rational, if we get to a contradiction by assuming the square root of 2 is rational, then we have to deduce that the square root of 2 must be irrational. So let's assume the opposite. Square root of 2 is rational. Well, if the square root of 2 is rational, that means that we can write the square root of 2 as the ratio of two integers, a and b. And we can also assume that these have no factors in common. Let's say that they did have some factors in common. If we divided the numerator and the denominator by those same factors, then you're getting into a situation where they have no factors in common. Or another way of saying is that a and b are co-prime. Or another way of saying it is we could write this as a ratio of two integers where this is irreducible, where these no longer share any factors. If you can write anything as the ratio of two integers, then you could obviously simplify it further, factor out any common factors to get it to a point where it is irreducible. So I'm going to assume that my a and b, that this fraction right over here, is irreducible. And this is important for setting up our contradiction. So I'm going to assume that this right over here is irreducible.  a and b have no factors in common. Let me write that down because that's so important for this proof. a and-- want to do that same color-- a and b have no factors in common, other than, I guess, 1.  So this is irreducible. These two numbers are co-prime. So what does that do for us? Well, let's just try to manipulate this a little bit. Let's square both sides of this equation. So if you square the principal root of 2, you're going to get 2. And that's going to be equal to a squared over b squared.  And that just comes from a over b squared is the same thing as a squared over b squared. And now we can multiply both sides of this by b squared. And so we get 2 times b squared is equal to a squared. Now, what does this tell us about a squared? Well, a squared is some number, b squared times 2. So anything times 2 is going-- this is going to be an integer. We assumed b is an integer, so b squared must be an integer, and so you have an integer times 2. Well, that must give you an even number. That must give you an even integer. So this right over here, a squared, must be-- so this tells us that a squared must be even. Now, why is that interesting? Well, a squared is the product of two numbers or is the product of the same number. It's a times a. So this is another way of saying that a times a is even. So what does that tell us about a? Let's just remind ourselves. a is either going to be-- we're assuming a is an integer-- a is either going to be even or odd. We just have to remind ourselves if we multiply an even times an even, we get an even number. If we multiply an odd times an odd, we get an odd number. So we have a number times itself. We got an even number. Well, the only way to get that is if that number is even. So this tells us that a is even. And another way of saying that a is even is to say that a can be represented as the product of 2 times some integer. So let's say some integer k. So where is all of this going? Well, as you'll see, we can then use this to show that b must also be even. So let's think about that a little bit. So let's go back to this step right over here. If we say that a can be represented as two times the product of some integer, and that comes out of the fact that a is even. Then we can rewrite this expression right over here as 2-- I'll do it over here-- 2 times b squared is equal to 2k squared. Instead of a squared, I could write 2k squared. We're claiming, or we're deducing, that, assuming everything we've just assumed, that a is even. So if a is even, it can be represented as a product of 2 and some integer. And then we can write that 2 times b squared is equal to 4k squared.  And then you divide both sides by 2. You get b squared is equal to 2k squared.  And this tells us that, well, k squared is going to be an integer. You take any integer times 2 you're going to get an even value. So this tells us that b squared is even.  So that tells us that b squared is even. Well, if b squared is even, by the same logic we just used, that tells us that b is even.  So here's our contradiction. We assumed, in the beginning, that a and b have no common factors other than 1. We assumed that this fraction right over here, a/b, is irreducible. But from that and the fact that a/b must be equal to the square root of 2, we were able to deduce that a is even and b is even. Well, if a is even and b is even, and they both have 2 as a factor, and then this isn't irreducible. You could divide the numerator and the denominator by 2. a and b have a common factor of 2. So let me write this down. So this is just to make it clear. So from this and this, we have a and b have common factor of 2, which means that a over b is reducible. And so that's the contradiction.  So you assume that square root of 2 can be represented as an irreducible fraction a/b, irreducible because you can say ratio of two integers right over here, that leads you to the contradiction that, no, it actually can be reducible. So, therefore, you cannot make this assumption. It leads to a contradiction. Square root of 2 must be irrational. ",math_algebra-home_alg-intro-to-algebra
" In this video, I want to familiarize you with the idea of a limit, which is a super important idea. It's really the idea that all of calculus is based upon. But despite being so super important, it's actually a really, really, really, really, really, really simple idea. So let me draw a function here, actually, let me define a function here, a kind of a simple function. So let's define f of x, let's say that f of x is going to be x minus 1 over x minus 1. And you might say, hey, Sal look, I have the same thing in the numerator and denominator. If I have something divided by itself, that would just be equal to 1. Can't I just simplify this to f of x equals 1? And I would say, well, you're almost true, the difference between f of x equals 1 and this thing right over here, is that this thing can never equal-- this thing is undefined when x is equal to 1. Because if you set, let me define it. Let me write it over here, if you have f of, sorry not f of 0, if you have f of 1, what happens. In the numerator, we get 1 minus 1, which is, let me just write it down, in the numerator, you get 0. And in the denominator, you get 1 minus 1, which is also 0. And so anything divided by 0, including 0 divided by 0, this is undefined. So you can make the simplification. You can say that this is you the same thing as f of x is equal to 1, but you would have to add the constraint that x cannot be equal to 1. Now this and this are equivalent, both of these are going to be equal to 1 for all other X's other than one, but at x equals 1, it becomes undefined. This is undefined and this one's undefined. So how would I graph this function. So let me graph it. So that, is my y is equal to f of x axis, y is equal to f of x axis, and then this over here is my x-axis. And then let's say this is the point x is equal to 1. This over here would be x is equal to negative 1. This is y is equal to 1, right up there I could do negative 1. but that matter much relative to this function right over here. And let me graph it. So it's essentially for any x other than 1 f of x is going to be equal to 1. So it's going to be, look like this. It's going to look like this, except at 1. At 1 f of x is undefined. So I'm going to put a little bit of a gap right over here, the circle to signify that this function is not defined. We don't know what this function equals at 1. We never defined it. This definition of the function doesn't tell us what to do with 1. It's literally undefined, literally undefined when x is equal to 1. So this is the function right over here. And so once again, if someone were to ask you what is f of 1, you go, and let's say that even though this was a function definition, you'd go, OK x is equal to 1, oh wait there's a gap in my function over here. It is undefined. So let me write it again. It's kind of redundant, but I'll rewrite it f of 1 is undefined. But what if I were to ask you, what is the function approaching as x equals 1. And now this is starting to touch on the idea of a limit. So as x gets closer and closer to 1. So as we get closer and closer x is to 1, what is the function approaching. Well, this entire time, the function, what's a getting closer and closer to. On the left hand side, no matter how close you get to 1, as long as you're not at 1, you're actually at f of x is equal to 1. Over here from the right hand side, you get the same thing. So you could say, and we'll get more and more familiar with this idea as we do more examples, that the limit as x and L-I-M, short for limit, as x approaches 1 of f of x is equal to, as we get closer, we can get unbelievably, we can get infinitely close to 1, as long as we're not at 1. And our function is going to be equal to 1, it's getting closer and closer and closer to 1. It's actually at 1 the entire time. So in this case, we could say the limit as x approaches 1 of f of x is 1. So once again, it has very fancy notation, but it's just saying, look what is a function approaching as x gets closer and closer to 1. Let me do another example where we're dealing with a curve, just so that you have the general idea. So let's say that I have the function f of x, let me just for the sake of variety, let me call it g of x. Let's say that we have g of x is equal to, I could define it this way, we could define it as x squared, when x does not equal, I don't know when x does not equal 2. And let's say that when x equals 2 it is equal to 1. So once again, a kind of an interesting function that, as you'll see, is not fully continuous, it has a discontinuity. Let me graph it. So this is my y equals f of x axis, this is my x-axis right over here. Let me draw x equals 2, x, let's say this is x equals 1, this is x equals 2, this is negative 1, this is negative 2. And then let me draw, so everywhere except x equals 2, it's equal to x squared. So let me draw it like this. So it's going to be a parabola, looks something like this, let me draw a better version of the parabola. So it'll look something like this. Not the most beautifully drawn parabola in the history of drawing parabolas, but I think it'll give you the idea. I think you know what a parabola looks like, hopefully. It should be symmetric, let me redraw it because that's kind of ugly. And that's looking better. OK, all right, there you go. All right, now, this would be the graph of just x squared. But this can't be. It's not x squared when x is equal to 2. So once again, when x is equal to 2, we should have a little bit of a discontinuity here. So I'll draw a gap right over there, because when x equals 2 the function is equal to 1. When x is equal to 2, so let's say that, and I'm not doing them on the same scale, but let's say that. So this, on the graph of f of x is equal to x squared, this would be 4, this would be 2, this would be 1, this would be 3. So when x is equal to 2, our function is equal to 1. So this is a bit of a bizarre function, but we can define it this way. You can define a function however you like to define it. And so notice, it's just like the graph of f of x is equal to x squared, except when you get to 2, it has this gap, because you don't use the f of x is equal to x squared when x is equal to 2. You use f of x-- or I should say g of x-- you use g of x is equal to 1. Have I been saying f of x? I apologize for that. You use g of x is equal to 1. So then then at 2, just at 2, just exactly at 2, it drops down to 1. And then it keeps going along the function g of x is equal to, or I should say, along the function x squared. So my question to you. So there's a couple of things, if I were to just evaluate the function g of 2. Well, you'd look at this definition, OK, when x equals 2, I use this situation right over here. And it tells me, it's going to be equal to 1. Let me ask a more interesting question. Or perhaps a more interesting question. What is the limit as x approaches 2 of g of x. Once again, fancy notation, but it's asking something pretty, pretty, pretty simple. It's saying as x gets closer and closer to 2, as you get closer and closer, and this isn't a rigorous definition, we'll do that in future videos. As x gets closer and closer to 2, what is g of x approaching? So if you get to 1.9, and then 1.999, and then 1.999999, and then 1.9999999, what is g of x approaching. Or if you were to go from the positive direction. If you were to say 2.1, what's g of 2.1, what's g of 2.01, what's g of 2.001, what is that approaching as we get closer and closer to it. And you can see it visually just by drawing the graph. As g gets closer and closer to 2, and if we were to follow along the graph, we see that we are approaching 4. Even though that's not where the function is, the function drops down to 1. The limit of g of x as x approaches 2 is equal to 4. And you could even do this numerically using a calculator, and let me do that, because I think that will be interesting. So let me get the calculator out, let me get my trusty TI-85 out. So here is my calculator, and you could numerically say, OK, what's it going to approach as you approach x equals 2. So let's try 1.94, for x is equal to 1.9, you would use this top clause right over here. So you'd have 1.9 squared. 1And so you get 3.61, well what if you get even closer to 2, 1so 1.99, and once again, let me square that. 1Well now I'm at 3.96. 1What if I do 1.999, and I square that? 1I'm going to have 3.996. 1Notice I'm going closer, and closer, 1and closer to our point. 1And if I did, if I got really close, 11.9999999999 squared, what am I going to get to. 1It's not actually going to be exactly 4, 1this calculator just rounded things up, 1but going to get to a number really, really, really, really, 1really, really, really, really, really close to 4. 1And we can do something from the positive direction too. 1And it actually has to be the same number 1when we approach from the below what we're trying to approach, 1and above what we're trying to approach. 1So if we try to 2.1 squared, we get 4.4. 1If we do 2. 1let me go a couple of steps ahead, 12.01, so this is much closer to 2 now, squared. 1Now we are getting much closer to 4. 1So the closer we get to 2, the closer 1it seems like we're getting to 4. 1So once again, that's a numeric way 1of saying that the limit, as x approaches 2 1from either direction of g of x, even though right at 2, 1the function is equal to 1, because it's discontinuous. 1The limit as we're approaching 2, 1we're getting closer, and closer, and closer to 4.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-limits-continuity
" SAL KHAN: This is Sal here again. And I'm still here with my good friend Dr. Mahadevan from Stanford University. And in the last video, we had looked at adequacy of x-rays, for the neck, which is, is the x-ray good enough. But now let's assume we have good x-rays. Now, what do we look at? DR. MAHADEVAN: The next step is to look at the alignment. So we talk about the ABCs of reading a cervical spine film. And A starts with adequacy, that we went over. And the second part of A is alignment. SAL KHAN: OK. So we're still in A. So now it's alignment. I was expecting something with a B. All right, alignment. All right. So this looks like this is about alignment. DR. MAHADEVAN: This is about alignment. And there's four lines that we look at. The first is the anterior vertebral body line. SAL KHAN: OK, AVBL, right over there. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. And basically, what you're doing is, you're trying to draw a smooth line that connects the anterior aspect, the front of all the vertebral bodies. It should be nice and smooth. It's usually curved. And all the points should sort of fit on that line. Nothing should be off of that line. That would suggest that there was a problem there. SAL KHAN: I see. And anterior, as you just said, means front. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. SAL KHAN: Right, OK. DR. MAHADEVAN: The next line is going to the back of the vertebral body. It's the posterior vertebral body. SAL KHAN: So not the back of the entire vertebrae, the vertebral body, which is this boxy part right in front. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. And so same thing, connecting a line up and down should be nice and smooth, as you've drawn it. And nothing should fall off that line. No piece of that vertebral body should fall off of the line you've draw. SAL KHAN: All right, sounds good. And then? DR. MAHADEVAN: The next is, we connect all the spinolaminar junctions. So this is the spinolaminar line. And it's where the lamina connects to the spinous process. SAL KHAN: Spinous process, it sounds like we could make a whole video about that. DR. MAHADEVAN: Spinous process, if you look at the back of somebody's neck, are those little bumps that you can see. And that's the very back end. SAL KHAN: And that's these triangular things right here. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. SAL KHAN: OK. So you're just connecting that line. Kind of the front of these triangles, the base of these triangles, so to speak. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. SAL KHAN: And then the last one? DR. MAHADEVAN: And the last line is the spinous process tips. And again, we're just connecting the top, the tip of all these spinous processes, the little bony projections you can see if you look at the back of somebody's neck. And these two should generally fall in a nice, smooth curve. SAL KHAN: And so the general rule-- if any of these aren't aligned the way that we've drawn here, it's a problem. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly, exactly. We call it subluxation or malalignment or misalignment. And these all suggest that there is a problem there. SAL KHAN: Which is a big deal, because your spinal cord is running through there. DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely. If you look between the two, the green and the blue line, that's actually where your actual spinal cord runs. SAL KHAN: Right. Right down there. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. SAL KHAN: I see. So you don't want that to get messed up. All right. So let's look at a few of these x-rays and see if, one, anything's wrong. Or if there's something, if we can spot it. DR. MAHADEVAN: Actually, Sal, now that you know how to read cervical spine x-rays. I'm going to have you look at the first x-ray. SAL KHAN: OK, let's see. I'm going to get sued for malpractice. Let's see. All right. So this one over here. So let me just do the first one. Let me just go with what you told me to do. So I'm going to do the anterior side of this vertebral body. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. SAL KHAN: Look, I'm learning the words too, talking like a doctor. So I'm going to draw a line here. That looks pretty good. That looks decent. What is it? I'm kind of-- let me see. This still looks decent. And that doesn't look great. Would this count? I mean, this looks like it got shifted over a little bit. DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely. SAL KHAN: It's not a huge shifting. But it's enough that it's not easy to draw a line. So I was right? DR. MAHADEVAN: You're absolutely right. And in fact, sometimes it's very subtle. And you picked up a very subtle abnormality. But again, even though it's subtle on the x-ray, it could be serious for the patient. So you potentially saved their spinal cord and their lives, by picking up an injury like this. SAL KHAN: OK, good. You're making me feel-- very good. So that's-- it's literally something as subtle as that is what you're looking for. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. Again, it should be a nice, smooth line or a nice, smooth curve. And as you can see, at that junction, it's no longer smooth. SAL KHAN: And you don't even have to look at the other lines. Any one of these that you don't align, that's enough to say, hey, do something else. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. And that's a great, important teaching point, which is, if you see any abnormality on a plane film on an x-ray like this, you stop. And you protect their cervical spine. And then you get a more important study or a better quality study, like a CT scan. SAL KHAN: Fascinating. Although if I do look here, it does look like we could have done the PVBL. And it looks like that also is a little off too. DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely. SAL KHAN: That one and-- OK, well, let's get a few more. DR. MAHADEVAN: Great. SAL KHAN: I don't want to focus too much on my first victory. All right. So it's clear this person is facing this way. I can see their teeth. So let's see what we can do here. Can I give it a shot again? DR. MAHADEVAN: Please, please. SAL KHAN: So let's-- the AVBL, it looks pretty good. This is-- well, that looks close. DR. MAHADEVAN: It looks close, I agree. And potentially, again, you've got a very keen eye and might have picked it up. But most people might-- SAL KHAN: A gift, you might say. DR. MAHADEVAN: --might have overlooked that. SAL KHAN: So let's try the other lines here. OK. So this one is more obvious. This one is more obvious that there's kind of that disconnection right over there. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. And this is the PVBL, or the posterior vertebral body line. You can see clearly, that line is not smooth. It doesn't connect, and so there is a problem right there at that junction. SAL KHAN: OK. All right, and so now we have this last one right over here. Let me see what I can do. Let me see, don't want to lose my streak. All right. So interior side-- this actually looks pretty perfect actually. DR. MAHADEVAN: And in fact, it is a perfect. SAL KHAN: OK. Let me try the next lines here. This is the posterior vertebral body. Let me do that in a color that's easier to see. I already used orange. I'll do magenta. All right. So this is looking OK. It looks OK. I mean, nothing obvious on that line. DR. MAHADEVAN: I would say, again, you've got the keen eye. But in this particular case, I'd say, it's fine. It's within the normal range, as we say. SAL KHAN: And so let me do the base of those triangles. Let me do-- so this is a triangle right over here. DR. MAHADEVAN: Again, you want it to be a nice, smooth curve. Everything should fall on that curve. SAL KHAN: So this-- I would have to be a little bit generous with my curve to make it go to these guys down here. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. And this is the spinal laminar line. This is the third line of alignment. As you can see, to try to get those to work, you could. But they're not smooth like the other lines. And this is, again, another subtle finding. But missing this finding because the first two lines are normal could again be devastating for the patient. SAL KHAN: Right. You always want to err on the side of caution. I mean, if anything looks even a little bit suspicious, maybe another x-ray. DR. MAHADEVAN: Yeah, another x-ray, another view, like we talked about before. Or the definitive study is a CT scan, or Computed Tomography. SAL KHAN: I see, very cool. Well, thanks for this. This is useful. DR. MAHADEVAN: My pleasure.",science_health-and-medicine_healthcare-misc
" -  We are told that a sample of a compound containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms is completely combusted, producing 5.65 grams of carbon dioxide and 3.47 grams of H2O or water. What is the empirical formula of the compound? So pause this video and see if you can work through that. All right, now let's just try to make sure we understand what's going on. They say that I have some mystery compound. It only contains carbon and hydrogen, so it's going to have some number of carbon, I'll call that x. Some number of hydrogens, I'll call that y. We're going to put it in the presence of molecular oxygen and it's going to combust and after it's combusted, I'm going to end up with some carbon dioxide and some water. And what I just drew here, this is a chemical reaction that I'm describing. I haven't balanced it. I could try to, even with the x's and y's, but that's not the point of this video. The point of this video is they tell us how many grams of the carbon dioxide we have and how many grams of the water we have, they tells us that right over there. And so what we need to do is say, all right, from that, we can figure out how many moles of carbon dioxide we have, how many moles of water we have, and from that, we can figure out how many moles of carbon did we start with and how many moles of hydrogen did we start with? And if we look at those ratios, then we can come up with the empirical formula of the compound. So just to start, because I'm going to be thinking about molar moles and molar masses and the mass of a mole of a molecule or an atom, let's just get the average atomic mass for carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen for us to work with. So I'll get out our handy periodic table. We can see hydrogen has an average atomic mass of 1.008. Let me write that down. So we have hydrogen is at 1.008, and then we have carbon, and carbon is at 12.01. So carbon is at 12.01, and we could also think about them in terms of molar masses. We could say this is gram per mole, grams per mole, and then last, but not least, we have oxygen and then oxygen is at 16.00 grams per mole. It's the average atomic mass, but whether we can think of that as molar mass, that number is molar mass. So oxygen is at 16.00 grams per mole. And so now we can try to figure out how many moles of C in the product do we have? So we can see that all of the carbon in the product is in the carbon dioxide that's in the product, and so we have 5.65 grams of CO2. We can think about how many moles of CO2 that is, so times one mole of CO2 for every how many grams of CO2. Well, we just have to think about, actually, let me just put it right over here. CO2, you're going to have, let's see, you have one carbon and two oxygens. So it is going to be 12.01 plus two times 16. Two times 16.00 grams per mole, and so let's see. This would get us to, this is 32 plus 12.01, so that is 44.01. And that's grams per mole, but now we're thinking about moles per gram, so it's going to be one over 44.01 and so if we did just this, the grams of CO2 would cancel the grams of CO2 and this would give us moles of CO2, but I care about moles of carbon in the product. So how many moles of carbon are there for every mole of CO2? Well we know that we have one mole of carbon for every one mole of CO2. Every carbon dioxide molecule has one carbon in it, and so what is this going to get us? So we have 5.65 divided by, divided by 44.01, and then times one, so I don't have to do anything there. That is equal to, I'll round it to three digits here, so 0.128, so this is 0.128 and my units here are, let's see. The grams of carbon dioxide cancel the grams of carbon dioxide. The moles of carbon dioxide cancel the moles of carbon dioxide, so I am exactly where I want to be. This is how many moles of carbon that I have. And you can do the dimensional analysis, but it also makes intuitive sense, hopefully. If this is how many grams of carbon dioxide we have and a mole of carbon dioxide is going to have a mass of 44.01 grams, well then 5.65 over this is going to tell us how, what fraction of a mole we have of carbon dioxide and then whatever that number of moles we have of carbon dioxide is gonna be the same as the moles of carbon, 'cause we have one atom of carbon for every carbon dioxide molecule, so that all makes sense. And now let's do the same for hydrogen. So let's think about moles of hydrogen in the product, and it's going to be the same exercise. And if you're so inspired and you didn't calculate it in the beginning, I encourage you to try to do this part on your own. All right, so all of the hydrogen is in the water, so and we know that we have, in our product, 3.47 grams of water. 3.47 grams of H2O, and now let's think about how many moles of H2O that is. So that's going to be, let's see, every one mole of H2O is going to have a mass of how many grams of H2O? And we could do that up here. H2O, it's going to be, we have two hydrogens, so it's going to be two times 1.008 plus the mass, the average atomic mass of the oxygen is going to be plus 16, but we can also view that as what would be the mass in grams, if you had a mole of it? And so this is going to be in grams per mole, and so this is going to be, let's see, two times 1.008. This part over here is 2.016, and then you add 16 to it. It's going to be 18.016. 18.016, and then if I just calculated this, this would give me how many moles of water I have in my product, but I care about moles of hydrogen. And so how many moles of hydrogen do I have for every mole of water? So for how many moles of hydrogen for every mole of water? Well I'm going to have two moles of hydrogen for every mole of water because in each water molecule, I have two hydrogens. And so that's going to cancel out with that and we're just going to be left with moles of hydrogen. And so this is going to be equal to, I'll take my 3.47 grams of water, divide it by the, how much, how many grams a mole of water, what its mass would be, so divided by 18.016. This is how many moles of water I have. Now for every, for every molecule of water, I have two hydrogens, so then I will multiply by two. Times two is equal to zero point, I'll just round three digits right over here. 0.385. 0.385 moles of hydrogen. So now we know the number of hydrogen atoms. We know the number of carbon atoms, and to figure out the empirical formula of the compound, we can think about the ratio between the two, so I'm gonna find the ratio of hydrogens to carbons. And that is going to be equal to, I have 0.385 moles of hydrogen over, over 0.128 moles of carbon. 0.128 moles of carbon, and what is this equal to? And it looks like it's going to be roughly three, but let me verify that. In my head, that seems so, I already have the hydrogen there, and so if I divide it by 0.128, I get, yep, pretty close to three. Now actually, I think if I, yep, pretty close to three, so there you go. This is approximately three, and so I can, with pretty good confidence, this was very close to three. I could say for every carbon, I have three hydrogens in my original compound, in this thing right over here.

" So you, as the ancient philosopher in mathematics have concluded in order for the multiplication of positive and negative numbers to be consistent with everything you've been constructing so far with all the other properties of multiplication that you know so far that you need a negative number times a positive number or a positive times a negative to give you a negative number and a negative times a negative to give you a positive number and so you accept it's all consistent so far.. this deal does not make complete concrete sense to you, you want to have a slightly deeper institution than just having to accept its consistent with the distributive property and whatever else and so you try another thought experiment, you say ""well what is just a basic multiplication way of doing it?"" So if I say, two times three, one way to to conceptualize is basic multiplication is really repeating addition, so you could view this as two threes so let me write three plus three and notice there are two of them, there are two of these or you could view this as three twos, and so this is the same thing as two plus two plus two and there are three of them, and either way you can conceptualize as you get the same exact answer. This is going to be equal to six, fair enough! Now, you knew this before you even tried to tackle negative numbers. Now let's try to make one of these negatives and see what happens. Let's do two times negative three, I want to make the negative into a different color. Two times negative three. Well, one way you could view this is the same analogy here, it's negative three twice so it would be negative.. I'll try to color code it negative three and then another negative three or you could say negative three minus three or, and this is the interesting thing, instead of over here there's a two times positive three you added two, three times. But since here is two times negative three you could also imagine you are going to subtract two, three times So instead of up here, I could written two plus two plus two because this is a positive two right over here, but since we're doing this over negative three we could imagine subtracting two, three times, so this would be subtracting two (repeated) subtract another two right over here, subtract another two and then you subtract another two notice you did it, once again, you did it three times, so this is a negative three, so essentially you are subtracting two, three times. And either way, you can conceptualize right over here, you are going to get negative six negative six is the answer. Now, so you are already starting to feel better about this part right over here negative times a positive, or a positive times a negative is going to give you a negative. Now lets take to the really un-intuitive one and measure negative times a negative, and all of a sudden negatives kind of cancel to give you a positive. Now why is that the case? Well we can just build from this example right over here. Let's say we had a negative two, lets say we had negative two, let me do it a different color, let's say we had a negative two, I already used this color negative two times negative three. So now, we can d- actually I'll do this one first. Let's do multiplying something by negative three so we'll repeatedly subtract that thing three times whatever that thing is so now the thing isn't a positive two so the thing over here is a positive two but the thing we're going to subtract is a negative two So let me make it clear, this says we are going to subtract something three times, so we subtract something three times, so subtracting something (repeatedly) three times That's what this part right over here tells us and we'll do this, exactly three times Over here, it was a positive two we subtracted three times, now we're going to do a negative two, now we're going to do a negative two and we know from subtracting negative numbers, we already built this intuition that subtracting a negative is the same thing it's the same thing as adding a positive, and so this this is going to be the same thing as two plus two plus two and we're told once again, gives you a positive six, you can same use the same logic over here, now instead of adding negative three twice, really I could have written this as negative three as this example negative three negative three, and we added it we added it, now let me put a plus here to make it clear over here we added it twice, we added negative three two times, or here since we have a negative two, we're going to subtract to negative three twice, so we're going to subtract something and we're going to subtract something again, and that something is going to be our negative three, it's going to be our negative three, so negative, negative and put our three right over here and once again, subtracting negative three is like taking away someone's debt, which is essentially giving them money, this is the same thing as adding three plus three which is once again six. So now you, the ancient philosopher, feel pretty good. Not only this all consistent with all the mathematics you know the distributive property is also the property of multiplying something times something all these things you already know, and now this actually makes conceptual sense to you, this is actually very consistent with with your notion, your original notion, or one of the possible notions of multiplication which is as repeated addition",math_in-in-class-7-math-kv_in-in-7-kv-integers
" -  So we wanna evaluate the definite integral from negative one to negative two of 16 minus x to the third over x to the third dx. Now at first this might seem daunting, I have this rational expression, I have xs in the numerators and xs in the denominators, but we just have to remember, we just have to do some algebraic manipulation, and this is going to seem a lot more attractable. This is the same thing as the definite integral from negative one to negative two of 16 over x to the third minus x to the third over x to the third, minus x to the third over x to the third dx. And now what is that going to be equal to? That is going be equal to the definite integral from negative one to negative two of, I could write this first term right over here, let me do this in a different color. I could write, I could write this as 16x to the negative three, x to the negative three, and this second one, we have minus x to the third over x to the third. Well x to the third is just over, x to the third over x to the third is just going to be equal to one. So this is going to be minus one dx, so dx. And so what is this going to be equal to? Well, let's take the antiderivative of each of these parts and then we're going to have to evaluate them at the different bounds. So, let's see. The antiderivative of 16x to the negative three, we're just gonna do the power rule for derivatives in reverse. You can view this as the power rule of integration or the power rule of taking the antiderivative where what you do is you're gonna increase our exponent by one, so you're gonna go from negative three to negative two, and then you're gonna divide by that amount, by negative two. So it's going to be 16 divided by negative two times x to the negative two. All I did is I increased the exponent and I divided by that amount. So that's the antiderivative here. And 16 divided by negative two, that is just negative eight. So we have negative eight, x to the negative two. And then the antiderivative of negative one, well, that's just negative x, negative, negative x, negative x. And actually you might just know that, and then hey, if I take the derivative of negative x I get negative one, or if you view this as negative x to the zero power, because that's what one is, well, it's the same thing. You increase the exponent by one to get x to the first power. And then you divide by one and so, I mean, you can view it as that right over there, but either way you get to negative or minus x. And so now we want to evaluate that. We're going to evaluate that at the bounds and take the difference. So we're going to evaluate that at negative two and then subtract from that this evaluated at negative one. And let me do those in two different colors so we can see what's going on. So we're gonna evaluate it at negative two and we're gonna evaluate it at negative one. So let's first evaluate it at negative two. So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, when you evaluate it at negative two, it's going to be negative eight, negative eight times x to the negative two. So negative two the the negative two power minus negative two. And from that we're going to subtract it and evaluate it at negative one. So, it's going to be negative eight times negative one to the negative two power minus negative one. All right, so then what is this going to be? So, negative two the negative two. So negative two to the negative two is equal to one over negative two squared, which is equal to 1/4. So this is equal to positive 1/4, but then negative eight times positive 1/4 is going to be equal to negative two. And then we have negative two minus negative two, so that's negative two plus two. And so everything I've just done in this purplish color that is just going to be zero. And then if we look at what's going on in the orange, when you evaluate it at negative one, let's see, negative one to the negative two power, well, that's one over negative one squared. Well, this all is just going to be one. And so we're gonna have negative eight plus one, which is equal to negative seven. So all of this evaluates to negative seven. But remember, we're subtracting negative seven, and so this is going to result, we deserve a little bit of a drum roll, this is going to be equal to positive, positive seven. And obviously you don't have to write that positive out in front, I just wrote that just to emphasize that this is going to be a positive seven.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-definite-integrals
" -  So I am here at desmos.com, which is an online graphing calculator, and the goal of this video is to explore how shifts in functions happen. How do things shift to the right or left or how do they shift up and down? And what we're going to start off doing is just graph a plain vanilla function, f of x is equal to x squared. That looks as we would expect it to look, but now let's think about how we can shift it up or down. Well one thought is, well, to shift it up, we just have to make the value of f of x higher so we can add a value, and that does look like it shifted it up by one. Whatever f of x was before, we're now adding one to it so it shifts the graph up by one, that's pretty intuitive. If we subtract one, or actually, let's subtract three. Notice, it shifted it down. The vertex was right over here at zero, zero. Now it is at zero, negative three, so it shifted it down. And we can set up a slider here to make that a little bit clearer, so if I just replace this with, if I just replace this with the variable k, then let me delete this little thing here, that little subscript thing that happened. Then we can add a slider k here, and this is just allowing us to set what k is equal to, so here, k is equal to one, so this is x squared plus one, and notice, we have shifted up, and if we increase the value of k, notice how it shifts the graph up, and as we decrease the value of k, if k is zero, we're back where our vertex is right at the origin, and as we decrease the value of k, it shifts our graph down. And that's pretty intuitive, 'cause we're adding or subtracting that amount to x squared so it changes, we could say the y value, it shifts it up or down. But how do we shift to the left or to the right? So what's interesting here is to shift to the left or the right, we can replace our x with an x minus something, so let's see how that might work. So I'm gonna replace our x with an x minus, let's replace it with an x minus one. What do you think is going to happen? Do you think that's going to shift it one to the right or one to the left? So let's just put the one in. Well, that's interesting. Before, our vertex was at zero, zero. Now our vertex is at one, zero. So by replacing our x with an x minus one, we actually shifted one to the right. Now why does that make sense? Well, one way to think about it, before we put this x, before we replaced our x with an x minus one, the vertex was when we were squaring zero. Now, in order to square zero, squaring zero happens when x is equal to one. When x is equal to one, you do one minus one, you get zero, and then that's when you are squaring zero. So it makes sense that you have a similar behavior of the graph at the vertex now when x equals one as before you had when x equals zero. And to see how this can be generalized, let's put another variable here and let's add a slider for h. And then we can see that when h is zero and k is zero, our function is really then just x squared, and then if h increases, we are replacing our x with x minus a larger value. That's shifting to the right and that is, as h decreases, as it becomes negative, that shifts to the left. Now right here, h is equal to negative five. You typically won't see x minus negative five. You would see that written as x plus five, so if you replace your x's with an x plus five, that actually shifts everything five units to the left. And of course, we can shift both of them together, like this. So here, we're shifting it up, and then we are, we could get back to our neutral horizontal shift and then we can shift it to the right like that. And everything we did just now is with the x squared function as our core function, but you could do it with all sorts of functions. You could do it with an absolute value function. Let's do absolute value, that's always a fun one. So instead of squaring all this business, let's have an absolute value here. So I'm gonna put an absolute, whoops. Absolute value, and there you have it. You can start at, let me make both of these variables equal to zero, so that would just be the graph of f of x is equal to the absolute value of x. But let's say you wanted to shift it so that this point right over here that's at the origin is at the point negative five, negative five, which is right over there. So what you would do is you would replace your x with x plus five, or you would make this h variable to negative five right over here, 'cause notice, if you replace your h with a negative five, inside the absolute value, you would have an x plus five, and then if you want to shift it down, you just reduce the value of k, and if you want to shift it down by five, you reduce it by five, and you could get something like that. So I encourage you, go to desmos.com. Try this out for yourself, and really play around with these functions to give yourself an intuition of how things and why things shift up or down when you add a constant, and why things shift to the left or the right when you replace your x's with an x minus, in this case, an x minus h, but it really could be x minus some type of a constant.",math_algebra2_transformations
" To power a single motor, you use the motor block, which is under your output here. However, this only works when you're powering a single motor. However, if you are building some sort of vehicle and you have multiple motors attached-- let's say you have a motor plugged into A and B-- you need to use the move block, which is under the common area, and the move block allows you to control multiple motors. And you do so by selecting the port your motors are plugged into, so in this example, I have A and B checked, and that's where my motors are plugged into. And now I can easily adjust the direction to both those motors here. And I can also adjust the steering to favor either towards A or B, and what steering does is it just adjusts the power being sent to those motors. And you also have an overall power setting for all motors that are plugged in. You can go to max power and all the way to 0. And the duration is how long you want this block to execute for. So you can do unlimited, and this will just continue running and you won't even need a loop in this case. You can also do some fine adjustments and say, I want my motors to turn five degrees, and because of the internal rotation sensor, it can do a very fine adjustment. You can also set it to do rotations, such as, I want my motors to rotate three times. There. And the last option is you can set the duration, so you can have your motors run for 2.5 seconds if that's what you need in your application. The final setting is Next Action, and what this does is it allows you to select Brake or Coast. Brake means when this block ends, the motors immediately shut off. And, however, you can also select Coast, which means the power ramps off slowly and you get this smoother response. So that's how you can control either multiple motors, or the same thing applies if you're using a single motor. It's all the same settings, except it only applies to a single motor port.",science_electrical-engineering_lego-robotics
" Let's compare the fraction 4/7 to the fraction 5/7. And what I want you to do right now is to pause this video and think about which of these fractions represents a larger quantity. I'm assuming you've had a go at it, and the one thing that might jump out at you is that they both have the same bottom number, which we call the denominator. They both have a denominator of 7. So one way to think about it is this is literally 4 sevenths. This is literally 5 sevenths. So we could rewrite 4/7 as literally 4 times 1/7. And we can rewrite 5/7 as literally 5 times 1/7. It's 5/7. So now if I have 4 of something versus 5 of something, which is going to be a larger quantity? Well, clearly 5 of this 1/7 is going to be more. So 4/7 is smaller, 5/7 is larger. And so what we can do is we can write a less than symbol. The way that I remember less than and greater than, is that the point, the small side of the symbol, always is on the same side as the smaller number. So this could be read as 4/7 is less than 5/7, or that 4 times 1/7 is less than 5 times 1/7. Now, let's do another scenario, but instead of having the same denominator, let's have the same numerator. So let's say we want to compare 3/4 versus-- let's say versus 3/9. Which of these two fractions is a larger number? And once again, pause the video and try to think about it on your own. Well, as we mentioned, we don't have the same denominator here. We have the same top number instead. Here is the same bottom number, same denominator. Here we're going to have the same numerator. We have the 3 right over there. And we could view 3/4 as literally 3 times 1/4. And we could view 3/9 as literally 3 times 1/9. So we have 3/4 and we have 3/9. So we really just have to about what's larger, a fourth or a ninth? Well, think about if you start with a whole-- think about starting with a whole like this. And let me make a whole right over here, so the same sized whole. A fourth is literally taking the whole and dividing it into 4 pieces. While a ninth is taking the whole and dividing it into 9. 9 equal sections, I could say. So let's divide this into 4 equal sections. So my best attempt to hand draw equal sections. So that's 2 equal sections and then that looks pretty close to 4 equal sections. So that right over there is 1/4. And let me draw ninths here. So let me first split this into 3 equal sections. So those would be third. And then split each of those into 3 equal sections. So this is my best attempt at that, at hand drawing 9 equal sections, splitting the whole into 9 equal sections. So when you see here-- and you might have already realized this-- if you divide something into 4 equal sections, each section is going to be bigger than if you divide it into 9 equal sections. A ninth is smaller than a fourth. A ninth is smaller than 1/4. So 3/9 is going to be smaller than 3/4. So once again, when you want to do less than or greater than, you want to put the point, the small side of the symbol, on the same side as the smaller number. So it would look like this. And this is the greater than symbol, because what you have on the left is the larger number. 3/4 is greater than 3/9. And if you actually wanted to represent not just 1/4 and 1/9, we could actually color it in. 3 times one fourth, well that's 1, 2, 3. While 3 times 1/9, or 3/9, is 1, 2, 3. And when you look at it that way, it's pretty clear. But the important thing to realize is, is that when the denominator is larger, you're dividing the whole into more pieces so each piece will be smaller. So making the denominator larger makes the fraction smaller. Making the numerator larger makes the fraction larger.",math_in-in-class-6-math-india-icse_in-in-6-fractions-icse
" -  What I'd like to do in this video is get an intuitive sense for what the derivative with respect to x of sine of x is and what the derivative with respect to x of cosine of x is. And I've graphed y is equal to cosine of x in blue and y is equal to sine of x in red. We're not going to prove what the derivatives are, but we're gonna know what they are, get an intuitive sense and in future videos we'll actually do a proof. So let's start with sine of x. So the derivative can be viewed as the slope of the tangent line. So for example at this point right over here, it looks like the slope of our tangent line should be zero. So our derivative function should be zero at that x value. Similarly, over here, it looks like the derivative is zero. Slope of the tangent line would be zero. So whatever our derivative function is at that x value, it should be equal to zero. If we look right over here on sine of x, it looks like the slope of the tangent line would be pretty close to one. If that is the case, then in our derivative function when x is equal to zero that derivative function should be equal to one. Similarly, over here, it looks like the slope of the tangent line is negative one, which tells us that the derivative function should be hitting the value of negative one at that x value. So you're probably seeing something interesting emerge. Everywhere, while we're trying to plot the slope of the tangent line, it seems to coincide with y is equal to cosine of x. And it is indeed the case that the derivative of sine of x is equal to cosine of x. And you can see that it makes sense, not just at the points we tried, but even in the trends. If you look at sine of x here, the slope is one, but then it becomes less and less and less positive all the way until it becomes zero. Cosine of x, the value of the function is one and it becomes less and less positive all the way until it equals zero. And you could keep doing that type of analysis to feel good about it. In another video we're going to prove this more rigorously. So now let's think about cosine of x. So cosine of x, right over here, the slope of the tangent line looks like it is zero. And so it's derivative function needs to be zero at that point. So, hey, maybe it's sine of x. Let's keep trying this. So over here, cosine of x, it looks like the slope of the tangent line is negative one and so we would want the derivative to go through that point right over there. All right this is starting to seem, it doesn't seem like the derivative of cosine of x could be sine of x. In fact, this is the opposite of what sine of x is doing. Sine of x is at one, not negative one at that point. But that's an interesting theory, maybe the derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x. So let's plot that. So this does seem to coincide. The derivative of cosine of x here looks like negative one, the slope of a tangent line and negative sign of this x value is negative one. Over here the derivative of cosine of x looks like it is zero and negative sine of x is indeed zero. So it actually turns out that it is the case, that the derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x. So these are really good to know. These are kind of fundamental trigonometric derivatives to know. We'll be able to derive other things for them. And hopefully this video gives you a good intuitive sense of why this is true. And in future videos, we will prove it rigorously.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-derivative-rules
" So let's just review what we've seen with budget lines. Let's say I'm making $20 a month. So my income is $20 per month. Let's say per month. The price of chocolate is $1 per bar. And the price of fruit is $2 per pound. And we've already done this before, but I'll just redraw a budget line. So this axis, let's say this is the quantity of chocolate. I could have picked it either way. And that is the quantity of fruit. If I spend all my money on chocolate, I could buy 20 bars of chocolate a month. So that is 20. This is 10 right over here. At these prices, if I spent all my money on fruit I could buy 10 pounds per month. So this is 10. So that's 10 pounds per month. That would be 20. And so I have a budget line that looks like this. And the equation of this budget line is going to be-- well, I could write it like this. My budget, 20, is going to be equal to the price of chocolate, which is 1, times the quantity of chocolate. So this is 1 times the quantity of chocolate, plus the price of fruit, which is 2 times the quantity of fruit. And if I want to write this explicitly in terms of my quantity of chocolate, since I put that on my vertical axis and that tends to be the more dependent axis, I can just subtract 2 times the quantity of fruit from both sides. And I can flip them. And I get my quantity of chocolate is equal to 20 minus 2 times my quantity of fruit. And I get this budget line right over there. We've also looked at the idea of an indifference curve. So for example, let's say I'm sitting at some point on my budget line where I have-- let's say I am consuming 18 bars of chocolate and 1 pound of fruit. 18-- and you can verify that make sense, it's going to be $18 plus $2, which is $20. So let's say I'm at this point on my budget line. 18 bars of chocolate, so this is in bars, and 1 pound of fruit per month. So that is 1. And this is in pounds. And this is chocolate, and this is fruit right over here. Well, we know we have this idea of an indifference curve. There's different combinations of chocolate and fruit to which we are indifferent, to which we would get the same exact total utility. And so we can plot all of those points. I'll do it in white. It could look something like this. I'll do it as a dotted line, it makes it a little bit easier. So let me draw it like this. So let's say I'm indifferent between any of these points, any of those points right over there. Let me draw it a little bit better. So between any of these points right over there. So for example, I could have 18 bars of chocolate and 1 pound of fruit, or I could have-- let's say that is 4 bars of chocolate and roughly 8 pounds of fruit. I'm indifferent. I get the same exact total utility. Now, am I maximizing my total utility at either of those points? Well, we've already seen that anything to the top right of our indifference curve of this white curve right over here-- let me label this. This is our indifference curve. Everything to the top right of our indifference curve is preferable. We're going to get more total utility. So let me color that in. So everything to the top right of our indifference curve is going to be preferable. So all of these other points on our budget line, even a few points below or budget line, where we would actually save money, are preferable. So either of these points are not going to maximize our total utility. We can maximize or total utility at all of these other points in between, along our budget line. So to actually maximize our total utility what we want to do is find a point on our budget line that is just tangent, that exactly touches at exactly one point one of our indifference curves. We could have an infinite number of indifference curves. There could be another indifference curve that looks like that. There could be another indifferent curve that looks like that. All that says is that we are indifferent between any points on this curve. And so there is an indifference curve that touches exactly this budget line, or exactly touches the line at one point. And so I might have an indifference curve that looks like this. Let me do this in a vibrant color, in magenta. So I could have an indifference curve that looks like this. And because it's tangent, it touches at exactly one point. And also the slope of my indifference curve, which we've learned was the marginal rate of substitution, is the exact same as the slope of our budget line right over there, which we learned earlier was the relative price. So this right about here is the optimal allocation on our budget line. That right here is optimal. And how do we know it is optimal? Well, there is no other point on the budget line that is to the top right. In fact, every other point on our budget line is to the bottom left of this indifference curve. So every other point on our budget line is not preferable. So remember, everything below an indifference curve-- so all of this shaded area. Let me actually do it in another color. Because indifference curve, we are different. But everything below an indifference curve, so all of this area in green, is not preferable. And every other point on the budget line is not preferable to that point right over there. Because that's the only point-- or I guess you could say, every other point on our budget line is not preferable to the points on the indifference curve. So they're also not preferable to that point right over there which actually is on the indifference curve. Now, let's think about what happens. Let's think about what happens if the price of fruit were to go down. So the price of fruit were to go from $2 to $1 per pound. So if the price of fruit went from $2 to $1, then our actual budget line will look different. Our new budget line. I'll do it in blue, would look like this. If we spent all our money on chocolate, we could buy 20 bars. If we spent all of our money on fruit at the new price, we could buy 20 pounds of fruit. So our new budget line would look something like that. So that is our new budget line. So now what would be the optimal allocation of our dollars or the best combination that we would buy? Well, we would do the exact same exercise. We would, assuming that we had data on all of these indifference curves, we would find the indifference curve that is exactly tangent to our new budget line. So let's say that this point right over here is exactly tangent to another indifference curve. So just like that. So there's another indifference curve that looks like that. Let me draw it a little bit neater. So it looks something like that. And so based on how the price-- if we assume we have access to these many, many, many, many, many indifference curves, we can now see based on, all else equal, how a change in the price of fruit changed the quantity of fruit we demanded. Because now our optimal spent is this point on our new budget line which looks like it's about, well, give or take, about 10 pounds of fruit. So all of a sudden, when we were-- so let's think about just the fruit. Everything else we're holding equal. So just the fruit, let's do, when the price was $2, the quantity demanded was 8 pounds. And now when the price is $1, the quantity demanded is 10 pounds. And so what we're actually doing, and once again, we're kind of looking at the exact same ideas from different directions. Before we looked at it in terms of marginal utility per dollar and we thought about how you maximize it. And we were able to change the prices and then figure out and derive a demand curve from that. Here we're just looking at it from a slightly different lens, but they really are all of the same ideas. But by-- assuming if we had access to a bunch of indifference curves, we can see how a change in price changes our budget line. And how that would change the optimal quantity we would want of a given product. So for example, we could keep doing this and we could plot our new demand curve. So I could do a demand curve now for fruit. At least I have two points on that demand curve. So if this is the price of fruit and this is the quantity demanded of fruit, when the price is $2, the quantity demanded is 8. And when the price is-- actually, let me do it a little bit different. When the price is $2-- these aren't to scale-- the quantity demanded is 8. Actually let me do it here-- is 8. And these aren't to scale. But when the price is $1, the quantity demanded is 10. So $2, 8, the quantity demanded is 10. And so our demand curve, these are two points on it. But we could keep changing it up assuming we had access to a bunch of indifference curves. We could keep changing it up and eventually plot our demand curve, that might look something like that.",economics-finance-domain_microeconomics_choices-opp-cost-tutorial
" -  We're talking about why biodiversity is important specifically to us as humans in the form of ecosystem services. Given that we'll lose about 20% of the present species richness by the middle of the century it's crucial to ask why that should matter to any of us. Should be worried about that loss? And why do so many of us care so much about it already. There are three main ways in which biodiversity is crucial to humans. The first is by direct services, the second is by indirect services, and the third is the aesthetic or ethical effect. We get so many things directly from biodiversity on this planet, food, clothing, housing, transportation, many medicines and medical supplies, and even energy in some cases. These things are derived directly from various ecosystems. Food goes without saying, all of our major food types, as diverse as they might be, originated in diverse ecosystems. Turns out, that they're a wild types of tomatoes still growing in Peru. These Peruvian tomatoes are a different species from the kind of tomato we typically eat and hold some of the genetic diversity within them. When bred with some of the tomatoes that we're using as our own food now, the yield from the hybrid tomatoes can go up almost as much as 50%. And, we wouldn't have that productivity if we'd let that wild type of Peruvian tomato go extinct. If we didn't have that as part of the biodiversity out there today, there's no way that we would have access to that genetic diversity. Another direct service provided by biodiversity is shelter. Originally, we built housing out of all kinds of biological materials and even today, we're still building houses out of trees. What about medicine? Almost all the medicines that humankind has developed have come directly from studying the way that organisms live in their environment, how they interact and the chemicals that they use during those interactions. The rosy periwinkle is a very famous example of a plant that grows in some very secluded environments in Madagascar. And it turns out that this plant produces a couple of very interesting chemicals that are now used to treat childhood leukemia. Again, we wouldn't have those medicines if the rosy periwinkle had gone extinct. Some of the more interesting things that I think people forget about when thinking about the value biodiversity fall under the category of indirect services that are delivered to us by healthy ecosystems. If you think about mangrove swamps which hare these fantastic places along the coastal margins of some tropical countries where specific types of trees, trees called mangroves grow. Mangroves can grow in salt water, so they form a semi-marine forest at the edge between land and sea. There are many species of mangrove trees and they're all really tough, resilient plants that provide tremendous services to us and to the natural environment. They protect the coastline from wave action and erosion, they're nurseries for all kinds of different types of organisms, and some of these are very important food types for us. Unfortunately, in certain parts of the world people are destroying the mangroves in order to make shrimp fisheries. They remove the mangroves and set up shrimp farms with the idea that they're adding economic value to that part of the coastline by putting in a shrimp farm that's going to produce a commercially viable product. But if you look at a graph of the value of these things then value of the shrimp farm is really only one third, maybe even only one quarter of the value of the original, undisturbed mangrove swamp because of the protection that the mangroves give against storms and erosion and the food sources they produce such as fish. You can actually attach a dollar value to these things which is sometimes the only way that people really come to grips with ecosystem value. It's the only way that people really understand the value of ecosystem services to humanity. Economic value of intact biodiversity has also been determined for ecosystems far from mangrove swamps, much closer to home. Some years ago, a large city on the east coast, which shall remain nameless, except that it's New York, had an issue with the quality of its source water. There are rivers feeding into the New York City area and the sources of that water were being compromised by pollution and environmental degradation to the point where biodiversity was being lost in some of those areas. So, city officials had a question in front of them, how do we deal in a cost effective way with this problem of declining quality of our water. It turns out that to build treatment plants to deal with cleaning the water up was gonna cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $6 billion just to build the treatment plants. Then another $300 million per year to maintain those plants and make sure that they were doing the things they were supposed to by removing the harmful chemicals that were being introduced through environmental degradation upstream. Then they looked at what it was gonna cost to clean up and restore the environments to make sure that the ecosystems and the biodiversity in those ecosystems were maintained to the point where they were doing what they would naturally do by removing chemicals from the water, basically filtering it through wetland habitat. Wetlands are tremendous, tremendous places for the recycling of dangerous chemicals and for the removal of chemicals from water and for clarifying and cleaning water. The cost for this restoration was gonna be about $1 billion, spread over 10 years. Much, much lower costs. So the answer was pretty clear, you're gonna go and spend that billion dollars over 10 years. Not only do you enhance the quality of the water in a very cost effective way but you do something else, too. And that addresses the third and final aspect of biodiversity value. The ethical and aesthetic services or value provided by biodiversity. These services may in fact be, in some ways, the most important ones. Sure, we can attach dollar values to the direct and indirect costs of a decline in biodiversity and the decline environmental services and ecosystem services but the ethical and aesthetic value is something that's very, very difficult to put a price on. You might say, okay, well, it costs so much to go visit a park or you might enjoy the views so much that you'll put a quarter into the telescope and soak in that environment but that's not really what we're talking about. The value here comes in what we leave for the future. A drop in biodiversity, removal of biodiversity, the extinction of species, those are things that we can't repair. Lost biodiversity is something we cannot bring back. So our children are gonna inherit a depleted world. The ethical and aesthetic quality of the environments that they're going to experience in their future, is gonna be decreased. How do you put a dollar value on that? We are the stewards of the environment but we are also the major influence on environmental quality and certainly on ecosystem function these days through our activities that result in pollution, over fishing, habitat destruction, loss of certain species from the environment. No one wants a world that's filled with nothing but wheat, corn, dandelions, some cows and us. That's a very simple ecosystem that's fraught with future difficulty and instability. If you reduce biodiversity to the point where the loss of species in the ecological food web causes an ecological collapse of that system, we won't be just standing by watching that collapse, we're going to be part of it. Clearly, biodiversity ecosystem are great places to live and to visit. There's much to see and make you feel happy, restful, appreciative, full of awe, reminded of what a remarkable and unique plant this is. After all, it's ours. I think there's a deeper sort of societal psychology at work here. And it behooves us to pay attention not just to the economically measured direct and indirect services and benefits provided by diversity rich, healthy ecosystems. But also to the ethical and aesthetic value of those amazing environments that are the inheritance we will leave for future generations.",science_biology_biodiversity-and-conservation
" -  If five is divided into pieces that are each one half of a whole, how many pieces are there? And this would be the equivalent of saying, ""What is five divided by 1/2?"" And they help us out with this visual. So pause this video and see if you can figure out what that is. How many pieces would you get if you divide five into pieces that are each one half of a whole? All right, now let's work through this together. So here on this number line we go from zero to five, and then notice they've divided into pieces that are each a half of a whole. This is one piece right over here. So how many of those halves, so this right over here is one half, how many of those halves does it take to make five? Well, two halves make a whole, and we have five wholes. So it's going to be five times two, or 10. And we see that right over here. One half, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 halves make five wholes. So this is going to be equal to 10. So five divided into pieces of one half, or five wholes divided into pieces of one half would be equal to 10 pieces. Let's do another example. So we have a similar question here. Here we're asked, ""If three wholes are divided into pieces that are each 1/6 of a whole, how many pieces are there?"" Once again, pause this video and think about it. Well, they really help us out with this visual because we have three wholes. This is one whole, two whole, and then three wholes, and then we have divided them into pieces that are each 1/6 of a whole. This is a sixth right over here, this is a sixth right over here, so each of these are sixths. And so, if we look at this, we have six sixths in a whole, and so in three wholes we're gonna have six, 12, 18 pieces. And you could literally just count these up. But it makes sense. If you take three wholes and you divide it into sixths, so this is a sixth right over here, each of these wholes are going to be six sixths, so three wholes are going to be three times six sixths, or 18 sixths. There you go.",math_5th-engage-ny_engage-5th-module-4
" - Diabetes mellitus is a syndrome that's caused by improper function of insulin, and, as a result, there's disregulation of the blood sugar levels. This results in high blood sugar, which is also known as hyperglycemia, but what exactly does this all mean? To get a better idea, let's first go over the body's normal regulation of blood sugar. To do that, I'm gonna just bring in a diagram here. In this diagram, you'll see up here, you have the esophagus, that goes into the stomach and into the beginning portion of the intestines. Then, here in pink, represents a blood vessel. In yellow here, is the pancreas. There are three major types of nutrients that your body uses for energy. There's fat, protein, and carbohydrates. We're gonna be focusing on carbohydrates. I'm gonna just abbreviate that CHO, which stands for carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, which is the chemical makeup of carbohydrates. The carbohydrates that we eat go through our esophagus and into our stomach and they start to get digested. As they enter into the intestines, they're digested down into glucose. Glucose is a simple sugar, and it's very important in the body because cells throughout the body use glucose as energy. Glucose, like I said, is a type of sugar, so, sometimes, people will refer to it as blood sugar levels, and what they are referring to are the level of glucose in the blood. This glucose is absorbed through the GI tract into the blood vessels here. Once it's in the blood, it then travels to the cells of the body, such as muscle cells, where it can be used for energy, or the glucose in the blood can travel to the liver, where it is stored to be used as energy in the future, so let's see this happen. This is where the role of the pancreas becomes important because glucose, on its own, is not able to actually enter the cells, like muscle cells, or into the liver. Without the pancreas, glucose would just become piled up in the blood. Luckily, the pancreas here can sense this pileup, or this increase in the blood sugar, and it releases a hormone known as insulin. When the pancreas releases this insulin, it kinda acts like a key that unlocks the cells of the body, such as the muscle cells and the liver, allowing the glucose to enter the cells, so, in the case of the muscle cells, those cells can now start to do work. In the case of the liver, the glucose can be stored. However, if this just kept going and insulin wasn't kept in check, what would happen, over time, and as you can see here, is that that blood glucose level would get too low. Fortunately, the pancreas can also sense when these blood glucose levels are getting too low and it stops secreting insulin, and it starts to secrete another hormone, known as glucagon. What glucagon does is it stimulates the liver to release this stored glucose back into the blood to replenish the blood glucose levels, and, eventually, the blood glucose levels return to normal. Let me draw a diagram here to help you remember how our bodies maintain the blood glucose levels. You can think of the maintece of the blood glucose level as being a balance between insulin, and if the balance is tipped in the direction of insulin here, it will result in the unlocking of cells. It will also allow the liver to store the glucose, then both of these things result in a lowering of the blood glucose level. Then, as this gets too far, the pancreas reacts, and it then has glucagon to shift the balance, by causing the release of that stored glucose, which results in a raising of the blood glucose level. Now that we have an understanding of how the body normally regulates blood glucose levels with insulin and glucagon, what exactly is going on in diabetes mellitus? Well, I mentioned at the beginning that diabetes mellitus is a syndrome that's caused by improper functioning of insulin, and in a sense, the insulin just doesn't work. This may be due to many different underlying causes, such as the pancreas here not being able to produce the insulin, the pancreas just may be producing too little insulin, or, for some reason, the cells may not be receptive to the insulin, in a sense that that key mechanism doesn't unlock the cells to allow the glucose to get in. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, though, when you don't have insulin here to balance out the blood glucose levels, this balance is gonna be tipped in the favor of glucagon. As such, what's gonna happen is these effects of glucagon here, are going to become more predomit, so what you see in diabetes mellitus, one of the characteristic findings is that there's going to be hyperglycemia. This is because the glucagon is causing the glucose from the liver to be released, and since insulin isn't functioning properly, this key effect here, also isn't working, so the cells aren't able to get all of this glucose that is in the blood, so despite having all of this energy present in the blood, the cells aren't able to use it, so someone with diabetes is, oftentimes, very fatigued or tired. That's because they're not able to extract the energy from the blood. Lastly, the body tries to compensate for this increased concentration of glucose here in the blood, and what it tries to do is it tries to dilute the blood with water from cells. What happens is that all this water leaves the cells, and the person becomes dehydrated, so, frequently, someone with diabetes will be dehydrated and very thirsty. Diabetes mellitus is a syndrome that's caused by dysfunctional insulin or a lack of insulin, resulting in an inability of the body to maintain its normal blood sugar balance, and you get this hyperglycemia here. Then, over time, actually, this persistent hyperglycemia can actually cause damage to many vital organs in the body, such as the nerves, eyes, and kidneys.",science_health-and-medicine_endocrine-system-diseases
" Now that we know how a signal can spread through a neuron, through an electrotonic potential and action potential and combinations of the two, let's put it all together by looking again at the structure of a neuron, the anatomy of a neuron, and thinking about why it has that anatomy and how it all can work. So we've already talked about the dendrites as being where the neuron can be stimulated from multiple inputs. If we're in the brain, these dendrites might be near the terminal ends of axons of other neurons. If we're some type of sensory cell, these dendrites could be stimulated by some type of sensory input. But let's just say, for the sake of argument, they are stimulated in some way. And because they're stimulated in some way, it allows positive ions to flood into the neuron from the outside. As we know, there's a potential difference. It's more negative inside of the neuron than outside of the neuron. And so if a channel gets opened up because of some stimulus, that would allow positive ions to flow in. And the primary positive ions we've been talking about are the sodium ions. Maybe this is some type of sodium gate that gets opened up because of this stimulus. So when that happens, you will have electrotonic spread. You will have an electrotonic potential being spread. So let's say that we had a voltmeter right here on the axon hillock. It's kind of the hill that leads to the axon right over here. So what you might see happening after some amount of time-- so let me draw. So let's say this is our voltage in millivolts across the membrane-- our voltage difference, I should say. This is the passage of time. Let's say the stimulus happens at time 0. But right at time 0, we haven't really noticed it with our voltmeter. Our voltage right across the membrane right over there is at that equilibrium, negative 70 millivolts. But after some small amount of time, this electrotonic potential has gotten to this point, because all of these positive charges are trying to get away from each other. It's gotten to that point. And you might see a bump in the voltage-- in the voltage difference, I guess I should say. This thing might go up. So it might look something like that. Now, that by itself might not be-- we might have gotten the voltage difference low enough, I guess we could say. Or we might not have gotten the voltage inside of the cell positive enough in order to trigger the voltage-gated ion channels. And so maybe nothing happens. Maybe this right over here, this is negative 55 millivolts. And so that's what you have to get the voltage up to, the voltage difference up to, in order to trigger the ion channels right over there. So those are the sodium channels to get positive charge in. Here's the potassium channels to get the positive charge out. The axon hillock has a ton of these, because these are really there. Once they get triggered, they can trigger an impulse that can then go down the entire axon, and maybe stimulate other things, maybe in the brain or whatever else this neuron might be connected to. So maybe that stimulus by itself didn't trigger it. But let's say that there's another stimulus that happens right at the same time, or around the same time. And that happens. And on its own, that might have caused a similar type of bump right over here. But when you add the two together and they're happening at the same time, their combined bumps are enough to trigger an action potential in the hillock, or a series of action potentials in the hillock. And so then, you really have, essentially, fired the neuron. So now all sorts of positive charge gets flushed into the neuron. And then purely through electrotonic spread, you will have this electrotonic potential spread down the axon. Now, this is the interesting part, because we can think a little bit about, what is the best way for an axon to be designed? In general, if you're trying to transfer a current, the ideal thing to do is, the thing that you're transferring the current down should conduct really well. Or you could say it has low resistance. But you want it to be surrounded by an insulator. You want it to be surrounded. So if this was a cross section, you want it to be surrounded by an insulator that has high resistance. And the reason is because you don't want the potential to leak across your membrane-- high resistance right over here. If you didn't have something high resistance around it, your current would actually go slower. This is true if you're just dealing with electronics. If you just had a bunch of copper wires on one side, and you had some copper wires that were surrounded by a really good insulator, a really good resistor-- for example, plastic or rubber of some kind. The current is actually going to have less energy loss. It's going to travel faster when it's surrounded by an insulator. So you might say, OK, well gee. The best thing to do would be to surround this entire axon with a good insulator. And for the most part, that is true. It is surrounded by a good insulator. That is what the myelin sheath is. So let's say we want to surround this whole thing with just one big grouping of Schwann's cells, so one big myelin sheath-- which is a good insulator. It does not conduct current well. So this right over here is just one big myelin sheath right over here. Now, what's the problem with this? Well, if this axon is really long-- and let's say, you know, you're a dinosaur or something. And you're trying to go up your neck, and your neck is 20 feet long. Or even a human being, we're a reasonable size. And you're going several feet, or even whatever, you want to go a reasonable distance purely with electrotonic spread, your signal, remember, it dissipates. Your signal is going to be really weak right over here. You're going to have a weak signal on the other end. It might not be even strong enough to make anything interesting happen at these terminals, which wouldn't be strong enough to trigger, maybe, other neurons, or whatever else might need to happen at this other end. So then you say, OK, well then why don't we try to boost the signal? Well, how would you boost the signal? You say, OK. I like having this myelin sheath. But why don't we put gaps in the myelin sheath every so often? And then those gaps would allow the membrane to interface with the outside. And in those areas, we could put some voltage-gated channels that can release action potentials, in order to essentially boost the signal. And that's is exactly what the anatomy of a typical neuron is like. So instead of just one big insulating sheath like this, it would-- let me make some gaps here. Whoops, I'm going to do that in black. So actually, let me just draw it like this. Let me just erase this. So clear, and let me clear this. That's good enough. And so what we could do is we could put gaps in it right over here where the axon, the axonal membrane itself can interface with its surroundings. And of course, we know we call those gaps the nodes of Ranvier, or Ran-Veer. I'm not really sure how to pronounce it. So let me put those gaps in here. So you put those gaps in here, so these are the myelin sheath. And this right over here is a node of Ranvier. These are nodes of Ran-Veer, or Ranvier. And right in those little nodes, right in those nodes, right where the myelin sheath isn't, we can put these voltage-gated channels to essentially boost the signal. If the signal had to go electrotonically all the way over here, it'd be very weak. It's going to dissipate as it goes down, but it could be just strong enough right at this point in order to trigger these voltage-gated channels, in order to essentially boost the signal again, in order to trigger an action potential, boost the signal. And now the signal is boosted, it'll dissipate, dissipate, dissipate, boost. And it'll boost right over here again. And then it'll dissipate, dissipate, dissipate, and boost. Dissipate, dissipate, boost. And so by having this combination, you want the myelin sheath. You want the insulator in order to keep the transmission of the current to fast, in order to have minimal energy loss. But you do need these areas where the myelin sheath isn't in order to boost the signal, in order for the action potentials to get triggered, and so your signal can keep being-- well, I guess keep being amplified, if we wanted to talk in kind of electrical engineering speak. And this type of conduction, where the signal just keeps boosting, and if you were just to superficially observe it, it looks like the signal is almost jumping. It gets triggered here, then it gets triggered, here then it gets triggered here, then it gets triggered here, then it gets triggered here. 1This is called saltatory conduction. 1It comes from the Latin word saltare-- once again, 1I don't know how to pronounce. 1My Latin isn't too good. 1But it comes from the Latin word saltare, 1which means to jump around or to hop around. 1And that's because it looks like the signal is hopping around. 1But that's not exactly what's happening. 1The signal is traveling passively through. 1It gets triggered here in the axon hillock. 1Then it travels passively through electrotonic spread. 1And then it gets boosted. 1And you have the myelin sheath around it 1to make sure it goes as fast as possible, 1and you get very little loss of signal. 1And then it gets boosted at the nodes of Ranvier, 1because it triggers these voltage-gated channels again. 1That triggers an action potential. 1And then your signal gets boosted, 1and then it dissipates-- boosted, dissipates, boosted, 1dissipates, boosted, dissipates. 1Maybe it could even get boosted again. 1And then it can trigger whatever else it has to trigger.",science_biology_human-biology
" -  In this video, we're going to think about what the derivative with respect to x of the natural log of x's. And I'm gonna go straight to the punch line. It is equal to one over x. In a future video, I'm actually going to prove this. It's a little bit involved. But in this one, we're just going to appreciate that this seems like it is actually true. So right here is the graph of y is equal to the natural log of x. And just to feel good about the statement, let's try to approximate what the slope of the tangent line is at different points. So let's say right over here, when x is equal to one, what does the slope of the tangent line look like? Well, it looks like here, the slope looks like it is equal, pretty close to being equal to one, which is consistent with the statement. If x is equal to one, one over one is still one, and that seems like what we see right over there. What about when x is equal to two? Well, this point right over here is the natural log of two, but more interestingly, what's the slope here? Well, it looks like, let's see, if I try to draw a tangent line, the slop of the tangent line looks pretty close to 1/2. Well, once again, that is one over x. One over two is 1/2. Let's keep doing this. If I go right over here, when x is equal to four, this point is four comma natural log of four, but the slope of the tangent line here looks pretty close to 1/4 and if you accept this, it is exactly 1/4, and you could even go to values less than one. Right over here, when x is equal to 1/2, one over 1/2, the slope should be two. And it does indeed, let me do this in a slightly different color, it does indeed look like the slope is two over there. So once again, you take the derivative with respect to x of the natural log of x, it is one over x. And hopefully, you get a sense that that is actually true here. In a future video, we'll actually prove it.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-derivatives-advanced
" What we're going to prove in this video is a couple of fairly straightforward parallelogram-related proofs. And this first one, we're going to say, hey, if we have this parallelogram ABCD, let's prove that the opposite sides have the same length. So prove that AB is equal to DC and that AD is equal to BC. So let me draw a diagonal here. And this diagonal, depending on how you view it, is intersecting two sets of parallel lines. So you could also consider it to be a transversal. Actually, let me draw it a little bit neater than that. I can do a better job. Nope. That's not any better. That is about as good as I can do. So if we view DB, this diagonal DB-- we can view it as a transversal for the parallel lines AB and DC. And if you view it that way, you can pick out that angle ABD is going to be congruent-- so angle ABD. That's that angle right there-- is going to be congruent to angle BDC, because they are alternate interior angles. You have a transversal-- parallel lines. So we know that angle ABD is going to be congruent to angle BDC. Now, you could also view this diagonal, DB-- you could view it as a transversal of these two parallel lines, of the other pair of parallel lines, AD and BC. And if you look at it that way, then you immediately see that angle DBC right over here is going to be congruent to angle ADB for the exact same reason. They are alternate interior angles of a transversal intersecting these two parallel lines. So I could write this. This is alternate interior angles are congruent when you have a transversal intersecting two parallel lines. And we also see that both of these triangles, triangle ADB and triangle CDB, both share this side over here. It's obviously equal to itself. Now, why is this useful? Well, you might realize that we've just shown that both of these triangles, they have this pink angle. Then they have this side in common. And then they have the green angle. Pink angle, side in common, and then the green angle. So we've just shown by angle-side-angle that these two triangles are congruent. So let me write this down. We have shown that triangle-- I'll go from non-labeled to pink to green-- ADB is congruent to triangle-- non-labeled to pink to green-- CBD. And this comes out of angle-side-angle congruency. Well, what does that do for us? Well, if two triangles are congruent, then all of the corresponding features of the two triangles are going to be congruent. In particular, side DC on this bottom triangle corresponds to side BA on that top triangle. So they need to be congruent. So we get DC is going to be equal to BA. And that's because they are corresponding sides of congruent triangles. So this is going to be equal to that. And by that exact same logic, AD corresponds to CB. AD is equal to CB. And for the exact same reason-- corresponding sides of congruent triangles. And then we're done. We've proven that opposite sides are congruent. Now let's go the other way. Let's say that we have some type of a quadrilateral, and we know that the opposite sides are congruent. Can we prove to ourselves that this is a parallelogram? Well, it's kind of the same proof in reverse. So let's draw a diagonal here, since we know a lot about triangles. So let me draw. There we go. That's the hardest part. Draw it. That's pretty good. All right. So we obviously know that CB is going to be equal to itself. So I'll draw it like that. Obviously, because it's the same line. And then we have something interesting. We've split this quadrilateral into two triangles, triangle ACB and triangle DBC. And notice, all three sides of these two triangles are equal to each other. So we know by side-side-side that they are congruent. So we know that triangle A-- and we're starting at A, and then I'm going to the one-hash side. So ACB is congruent to triangle DBC. And this is by side-side-side congruency. Well, what does that do for us? Well, it tells us that all of the corresponding angles are going to be congruent. So for example, angle ABC is going to be-- so let me mark that. You can say ABC is going to be congruent to DCB. And you could say, by corresponding angles congruent of congruent triangles. I'm just using some shorthand here to save some time. So ABC is going to be congruent to DCB, so these two angles are going to be congruent. Well, this is interesting, because here you have a line. And it's intersecting AB and CD. And we clearly see that these things that could be alternate interior angles are congruent. And because we have these congruent alternate interior angles, we know that AB must be parallel to CD. So this must be parallel to that. So we know that AB is parallel to CD by alternate interior angles of a transversal intersecting parallel lines. Now, we can use that exact same logic. We also know that angle-- let me get this right. Angle ACB is congruent to angle DBC. And we know that by corresponding angles congruent of congruent triangles. So we're just saying this angle is equal to that angle. Well, once again, these could be alternate interior angles. They look like they could be. This is a transversal. And here's two lines here, which we're not sure whether they're parallel. But because the alternate interior angles are congruent, we know that they are parallel. So this is parallel to that. So we know that AC is parallel to BD by alternate interior angles. And we're done. So what we've done is-- it's interesting. We've shown if you have a parallelogram, opposite sides have the same length. And if opposite sides have the same length, then you have a parallelogram. And so we've actually proven it in both directions. And so we can actually make what you call an ""if and only if"" statement. You could say opposite sides of a quadrilateral are parallel if and only if their lengths are equal. And you say if and only if. So if they are parallel, then you could say their lengths are equal. And only if their lengths are equal are they parallel.

" -  What we're going to do in this video is talk about acidity and in particular, we're gonna talk about the pH scale. Now the first question is what does pH stand for and it turns out that there's some debate why we have this lowercase p here, we know why we have the h, and some people will tell you it stands for power of hydrogen, the capital h for hydrogen. Some people will say it's the potential of hydrogen. Some people will say it's the capacity for hydrogen, you might say capacity doesn't start with a p but if you go into Latin, it can. But what do all of these things mean and why do we care about hydrogen so much? Well, it turns out that hydrogen, and in particular, a hydrogen positive ion, and ion is just a positively charged molecule, that a hydrogen ion can play a major role in how acidic or basic something is. And so the pH scale, you're gonna see it go from zero all the way to 14 with of course, seven in the middle, and something that is towards the left, something that is less than seven is considered acidic, and so if you have a pH near zero that is highly, highly, highly acidic, while something to the right is considered basic and something in the middle is considered neutral. And another term for basic you'll sometimes see is alkaline, and alkaline actually comes from Arabic for alkali which was the word that ancient Arab chemists use for a compound that happens to be very basic by our modern definition. But what does it mean to be acidic and what does it mean to be basic and once again, how does that connect with hydrogen ions? Well, it turns out, and I'm not gonna go in depth in this video, is that things that are acidic tend to have lots of hydrogen ions and while things that are basic tend to react, react with these hydrogen ions. There's other definitions for what it means to be an acid or base and we'll go into depth in chemistry class on that, but this is why it's connected with the term pH. Now what are examples of things that are acidic? Well, you see it on this chart right over here. Here, we're going in the vertical direction. Things in our everyday life that are quite acidic, a lot of fruits are quite acidic, for example, lemons and grapefruits and orange juice are quite acidic. They're at the low end of the scale. And some of the telltale signs for acidity is if you were to drink it or eat it, that it would have this kind of sharp sour taste to it, while if you go to the other end of the spectrum, things that are basic, these would be things like bleaches and ammonia solution and we can even go super basic to liquid drain cleaner, and these are going to have more of a slimy texture to it. In fact, even soap is quite basic. And of the basic things that you could eat, you might have a bitter taste associated with it. But to be clear, I really don't recommend eating or drinking anything that is either highly basic or highly acidic, and the reason is is that things that are at the extreme of the pH scale, so things that are either extremely basic or things that are extremely acidic like battery acid or hydrochloric acid, because they're so reactive, they will damage you. If you pour it in your skin, it will damage you. If you ingest it, it will damage your cells and it can even kill you. So don't try to taste things to see whether they're acid or basic, and if you do, try to make sure that they're closer to this middle range of our pH scale. So I've talked a lot about things that are acidic or basic, but also what's interesting is things that we consider to be neutral. So our blood, for example, is quite neutral, and this is something that doctors might measure because if your pH in your blood gets a little bit too high or a little bit too low, that can cause some serious problems. Sea water is pretty close to being neutral. Milk is not that far off of being neutral. Now with that said, in order to read the pH scale appropriately or appreciate the differences in acidity and basicity, it's important to realize that it is not a linear scale. So for example, something that has a pH of eight is not twice as basic as something that has a pH of four. It turns out, when you go form one level of our pH scale to the other, you are going up in basicity, say going from a pH four to a pH of five, by a factor of 10. And so, comparing something with a pH of four to a pH of eight, that thing with the pH of four would be 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000 times more acidic, or you could say the thing with a pH of eight is 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000 times more basic. So I'll leave you there. Keep a lookout when people talk about pH balance or blood pH, and we're also, as we study more and more biology, we're gonna talk about how pH might influence some biological reactions and especially once you get into chemistry, pH will inform us what type of reaction is likely to happen.",science_in-in-class-10-chemistry-india_in-in-acids-bases-and-salts
" -  Nth derivative of g at x equals zero is given by, so the nth derivative of g evaluated x equals zero is equal to square root of n plus seven over n to the third for n is greater than or equal to one. What is the coefficient for the term containing x squared in the Maclaurin series of g? Let's just think about the Maclaurin series for g. If I were to have my function g of x. The Maclaurin series, I could say approximately equal to especially if I'm not gonna list out all of the terms, is going to be equal to, well it's going to be equal to g of zero plus g prime of zero times x plus g prime prime of zero divided by, I could say two factorial but that's just two, times x squared, and that's about as far as we go. Because we just have to think about what is the coefficient for the term containing x squared. If they said what's the coefficient for the term containing x to the third, I would keep going. I'd go g prime. I would take the third derivative evaluated at zero over three factorial. I could do this as a factorial too, but that just evaluates to two. I could do this as one factorial. I could do this as zero factorial just so you see it's a consistent idea here. I could, of course, keep on going, but we just care about, they're just asking us what is the coefficient for the term containing x squared? They just want us to figure out this. What is this thing right over here? To know that, we need to figure out what is the second derivative of g evaluated x equals zero? Well they tell us that over here. It's a little bit unconventional where they give us a formula, a general formula for any derivative evaluated x equals zero, but that's what they're telling us here. So in this case, the n isn't zero. The n is the derivative we're taking, and that's going to be our second derivative, so this is, so if I wanted to figure out g. If I am figuring out the second derivative, and I could write it like that evaluated zero, or I could write it like this just so the notation is consistent. I could write it like that. The second derivative evaluated x equals zero is going to be equal to, well our n is two, so this is going to be the square root of two plus seven over two to the third power. Two plus seven is nine, take the principle root of that. It's gonna give us positive three over two to the third which is eight, so this part right over here is 3/8, so the whole coefficient is going to be 3/8, that's this numerator, divided by, divided by two. Which of course is equal to 3/16, and we're done. They didn't want us to figure out a couple of terms of this which we could call the Maclaurin polynomial and nth degree Maclaurin polynomial. They didn't want us to find the entire, you know, keep going with this series. They just wanted to find one coefficient right here. The coefficient on the second degree term which we just figured out is 3/16.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-series-new
" We know a little bit about magnets now. Let's see if we can study it further and learn a little bit about magnetic field and actually the effects that they have on moving charges. And that's actually really how we define magnetic field. So first of all, with any field it's good to have a way to visualize it. With the electrostatic fields we drew field lines. So let's try to do the same thing with magnetic fields. Let's say this is my bar magnet. This is the north pole and this is the south pole. Now the convention, when we're drawing magnetic field lines, is to always start at the north pole and go towards the south pole. And you can almost view it as the path that a magnetic north monopole would take. So if it starts here-- if a magnetic north monopole, even though as far as we know they don't exist in nature, although they theoretically could, but let's just say for the sake of argument that we do have a magnetic north monopole. If it started out here, it would want to run away from this north pole and would try to get to the south pole. So it would do something, its path would look something like this. If it started here, maybe its path would look something like this. Or if it started here, maybe its path would look something like this. I think you get the point. Another way to visualize it is instead of thinking about a magnetic north monopole and the path it would take, you could think of, well, what if I had a little compass here? Let me draw it in a different color. Let's say I put the compass here. That's not where I want to do it. Let's say I do it here. The compass pointer will actually be tangent to the field line. So the pointer could look something like this at this point. It would look something like this. And this would be the north pole of the pointer and this would be the south pole of the pointer. Or you could-- that's how north and south were defined. People had compasses, they said, oh, this is the north seeking pole, and it points in that direction. But it's actually seeking the south pole of the larger magnet. And that's where we got into that big confusing discussion of that the magnetic geographic north pole that we're used to is actually the south pole of the magnet that we call Earth. And you could view the last video on Introduction to Magnetism to get confused about that. But I think you see what I'm saying. North always seeks south the same way that positive seeks negative, and vice versa. And north runs away from north. And really the main conceptual difference-- although they are kind of very different properties-- although we will see later they actually end up being the same thing, that we have something called an electromagnetic force, once we start learning about Maxwell's equations and relativity and all that. But we don't have to worry about that right now. But in classical electricity and magnetism, they're kind of a different force. And the main difference-- although you know, these field lines, you can kind of view them as being similar-- is that magnetic forces always come in dipoles, soon. while you could have electrostatic forces that are monopoles. You could have just a positive or a negative charge. So that's fine, you say, Sal, that's nice. You drew these field lines. And you've probably seen it before if you've ever dropped metal filings on top of a magnet. They kind of arrange themselves along these field lines. But you might say, well, that's kind of useful. But how do we determine the magnitude of a magnetic field at any point? And this is where it gets interesting. The magnitude of a magnetic field is really determined, or it's really defined, in terms of the effect that it has on a moving charge. So this is interesting. I've kind of been telling you that we have this different force called magnetism that is different than the electrostatic force. But we're defining magnetism in terms of the effect that it has on a moving charge. And that's a bit of a clue. And we'll learn later, or hopefully you'll learn later as you advance in physics, that magnetic force or a magnetic field is nothing but an electrostatic field moving at a very high speed. At a relativistic speed. Or you could almost view it as they are the same thing, just from different frames of reference. I don't want to confuse you right now. But anyway, back to what I'll call the basic physics. So if I had to find a magnetic field as B-- so B is a vector and it's a magnetic field-- we know that the force on a moving charge could be an electron, a proton, or some other type of moving charged particle. And actually, this is the basis of how they-- you know, when you have supercolliders-- how they get the particles to go in circles, and how they studied them by based on how they get deflected by the magnetic field. But anyway, the force on a charge is equal to the magnitude of the charge-- of course, this could be positive or negative-- times, and this is where it gets interesting, the velocity of the charge cross the magnetic field. So you take the velocity of the charge, you could either multiply it by the scalar first, or you could take the cross product then multiply it by the scalar. Doesn't matter because it's just a number, this isn't a vector. But you essentially take the cross product of the velocity and the magnetic field, multiply that times the charge, and then you get the force vector on that particle. Now there's something that should immediately-- if you hopefully got a little bit of intuition about what the cross product was-- there's something interesting going on here. The cross product cares about the vectors that are perpendicular to each other. So for example, if the velocity is exactly perpendicular to the magnetic field, then we'll actually get a number. If they're parallel, then the magnetic field has no impact on the charge. That's one interesting thing. And then the other interesting thing is when you take the cross product of two vectors, the result is perpendicular to both of these vectors. So that's interesting. A magnetic field, in order to have an effect on a charge, has to be perpendicular to its you velocity. And then the force on it is going to be perpendicular to both the velocity of the charge and the magnetic field. I know I'm confusing you at this point, so let's play around with it and do some problems. But before that, let's figure out what the units of the magnetic field are. So we know that the cross product is the same thing as-- so let's say, what's the magnitude of the force? The magnitude of the force is equal to? Well, the magnitude of the charge-- this is just a scalar quantity, so it's still just the charge-- times the magnitude of the velocity times the magnitude of the field times the sine of the angle between them. This is the definition of a cross product and then we could put-- if we wanted the actual force vector, we can just multiply this times the vector we get using the right-hand rule. We'll do that in a second. Anyway we're just focused on units. Sine of theta has no units so we can ignore it for this discussion. We're just trying to figure out the units of the magnetic field. So force is newtons-- so we could say newtons equals-- charge is coulombs, velocity is meters per second, and then this is times the-- I don't know what we'll call this-- the B units. We'll call it unit sub B. So let's see. If we divide both sides by coulombs and meters per second, we get newtons per coulomb. And then if we divide by meters per second, that's the same thing as multiplying by seconds per meter. Equals the magnetic field units. So the magnetic field in SI terms, is defined as newton seconds per coulomb meter. And that might seem a little disjointed, and they've come up with a brilliant name. And it's named after a deserving fellow, and that's Nikolai Tesla. And so the one newton second per coulomb meter is equal to one tesla. And I'm actually running out of time in this video, because I want to do a whole problem here. But I just want you to sit and think about it for a second. Even though in life we're used to dealing with magnets as we have these magnets-- and they're fundamentally maybe different than what at least we imagine electricity to be-- but the magnitude or actually the units of magnetism is actually defined in terms of the effect that it would have on a moving charge. And that's why the unit-- one tesla, or a tesla-- is defined as a newton second per coulomb. So the electrostatic charge per coulomb meter. Well, I'll leave you now in this video. Maybe you can sit and ponder that. But it'll make a little bit more sense when we do some actual problems with some actual numbers in the next video.

" In this video I'm going to work through the exact same scenario that we saw in the last video but it will be a little bit more mathy. The reason why I'm going to make it a little bit more mathy is so that you see it's a same idea it's just going to have a little bit more cryptic notation but it allows us to generalize the ideas that we saw in the last video. Let's just assume, instead of saying that the marginal propensity to consume in our little island is .6, let's just say our marginal propensity to consume is C. What we want to do is we want to figure out, given some initial change in expenditure and this guy's change in expenditure will be this guy's change in income. That cycle is round and round due to the multiplier effect. What is going to be the total change in our GDP? This is what we care about, we care about our total change in the GDP. Y could be viewed as expenditure or it could be viewed as income depending on how you think about things. Let's say this guy, instead of saying that's he's going to spend all in the thousand dollars, let's just call his incremental change in expenditure, let's just call that delta Y nought. Delta just means change in, and Y, we could view this as aggregate expenditure. I'm putting this little zero here. This is our first iteration, this is the first time that we're doing one these deltas. Then as we keep doing them we're going to have Y1, Y2, Y3 and so on and so forth. If we think about the total change in GDP, you're definitely going to have this. In the last example this was $1000. This guy is $1000 expenditures, this guy is a $1000 income. Then you have delta Y nought. Then we saw that this guy, his marginal propensity to consume is C. He's going to spend of the income he gets, he's going to spend C times that. He's now going to do Delta Y1. This is the next incremental bump in our GDP we're seeing and that's going to be equal to C times what he just got. Now, after doing the zero iteration in the first iteration our total change is going to be ... Actually let me write it this way, times delta Y1, and delta Y1, this is just the same thing as C x delta Y nought. It's fancy notation but it's just saying something fairly basic, The exact same thing that we said in the last video. Now this guy, all of a sudden, above and beyond what he spent in that zeroth iteration, he's now getting delta Y1. He has a marginal propensity to consume, we're just assuming of C. Now he is going to spend C times that. He's now going to make an expenditure of, I'll do this just in the same color, he's now going to do delta Y2 which is equal to C x delta Y1. Now we have delta Y2, this new incremental bump and they're getting smaller and smaller and smaller but we can go an infinite number of times. Just to remember what this is, delta Y2 is the same thing as C x delta Y1. Delta Y1 is the same thing as C x delta Y nought. So this thing right over here, this whole thing could be written as C^2 x delta Y nought. This right over here C x delta Y nought. This of course is equal to, this is just delta Y nought. We can just keep going. If this guy would then get this amount and he'll spent C times that to the farmer and so if we had a Y3, it would just amount to C times this which is C^3 x delta Y nought and we could keep going on and on and on an infinite number of time but each of these terms are going to smaller and smaller because we're going to assume, in order for this to actually work, we're going to assume that C is between 0 and 1. Obviously, when someone gets new income and thinking of the simple case, someone is not going to spend more, the marginal propensity to consume, they can't spend more than they just got. In general they're not going to spend the whole thing. So we're going to assume that it is less than 1. This is exactly the same idea that we did in the last one but now it is general and we can simplify this a little bit mathematically. This is all equal to our delta Y, our total bump in GDP due to that initial spark. If we factor that initial spark out with the delta Y nought. Actually, let me do that in different color just so the math becomes clear. We have the delta Y nought, delta Y nought, delta Y nought, delta Y nought. When I say nought, I'm talking about that zero subscript. If we factor that our, we get our total bump in GDP. Whether you want to do this output, expenditure or income, is equal to, we're going to factor that out, the delta Y nought times, and then we're just left with, you factor the change in Y nought here you get 1 and then over here, + C + C^2 + C^3 and you go on and on and on. In the last video I told you that this right over here is going to simplify to 1 over 1 - C. This is equal to, this part over here is equal to 1 over 1 - C. Now, you might have not been satisfied and since this is a more mathy video it's a good place to actually show you that it would sum up to 1 over 1 - C. Not to introduce too many variables, but let's just call this thing X. Let's just say that X is equal to this whole thing right over here. It's equal 1 + C + C^2 + C^3, so on and so forth. Now let's imagine what we would get if we multiply X x C. What happens if I multiply, and I'll do this in a different color. What happens if I multiply C x X? Well then, each of these terms I can multiply by C. 1 x C is C, C x C is C^2, C^2 x C is C^3, C^3 x C is C^4, so on and so forth. Now, what happens if I subtract this from that? If I subtract the left hand sides I get X - CX on the left hand side. I'll do that in that pink color. Where did it go? Actually I think I changed the color on my ... I'll just write X - CX and that's going to be equal to, if you subtract this stuff from that stuff over there, you have a C - C, they'll cancel out. Let me do this in yellow. C^2 - C^2, that will cancel out. C^3 - C^3, that would cancel out. Every term other than 1 is going to cancel out. Everything is going to cancel out and you're just going to be left with the 1 here which is a pretty neat trick in my mind. Then we can factor out the X right over here. You get X x 1 - C = 1 and then you divide both sides by 1 - C, you get X = 1 over 1 - C. X was exactly this thing right over here. This thing is equal to 1 over 1 - C. This right here, we just showed you exactly what we told you in the last video that the total bump in GDP, this right over here, you could view this as the total bump in GDP is going to be equal to that initial bump in GDP which we called delta Y nought. That was that initial spending that that farmer did and the builders initial income, that the total bump is going to be equal to that initial bump times this expression which we view as the multiplier. This is the multiplier right here is a function of the marginal propensity to consume. This right over here, let me label it all. Actually, let me just rewrite it. The total bump in our aggregate expenditure or output or income is going to be equal to the initial bump times the multiplier which ends up being a function of our marginal propensity to consume. This right over here is our multiplier and this right over here is, you could view that as our initial bump. Just to make sure that it works out from what we saw in the last video. In the last video our marginal propensity to consume was .6. C was 0.6 and our initial bump, our initial expenditure was equal to 1,000. If you put .6 in here you will get 2.5 and so you get the exact same multiplier and you get the exact same total bump in GDP as we got in the last video. At least now we have a little general and you're hopefully a little bit more comfortable with some of these notation that I'm using. Unfortunately, you'll see different notation almost every economics textbook. I just want to make sure that this makes reasonable sense to you.",economics-finance-domain_macroeconomics_aggregate-supply-demand-topic
" - What we have here is a zoom-in of the surface of water. So up here you have the air, this is the air, these are some air molecules, maybe they're nitrogen molecules. They're fairly far apart, in fact, in reality, they would be even more far apart than this. And then over here you have water molecules. We've seen this many times. You have the oxygen atom and it's bonded to two hydrogen atoms, and the oxygen atom likes to hog the electrons more. It's more electronegative, so you have a partially negative charge at this end and partially positive ends at this end. And that attraction between the partially positive ends and the partially negative ends, that's what gives water all sorts of neat properties. Those are the hydrogen bonds. Those are the hydrogen bonds that give water all sorts of neat properties and keep it in its liquid state at a standard temperature and pressure. Now what I want to think about is the surface in particular. And if you look at the surface of water, it might look completely smooth. But if you were to zoom in on a molecular level, you'll see that, well, it's just made up of these molecules. But roughly speaking, roughly speaking, let's just say that this is roughly the surface, the surface of the water. The surface of the water. Now, what's going on at the surface? Well, all these molecules are interacting through hydrogen bonds. Let's say this molecule right over here, it has hydrogen bonds pulling on it upwards, up to this one, pulling it this way, pulling it downwards, pulling it in really, really, to some degree, almost every direction. And they all have their kinetic energy and they're bumping around, but they're flowing past each other. The hydrogen bonds are giving that cohesiveness. The molecules are attracted to each other. But if you look at the molecules on the surface, if you look at the ones on the surface, sure, they might have stuff pulling down on them, they might have stuff pulling them to the side, but they don't have anything pulling on them from above. And because of this, you could imagine that they're able to get a little bit more densely packed, that they're able to get a little closer to their neighbors. And this is what allows them to actually have a stronger, I guess you could say, intermolecular force at the surface than you have within the body, and that causes a phenomenon known as surface tension. So you have stronger, you have kind of a deeper, and this is still just hydrogen bonds, but since they're not being pulled in other directions by, upwards by the air, they're able to get a little bit more closely packed, a little bit tighter, and this we refer to as surface tension, surface tension. And you have probably observed surface tension many, many, many times in your life in the form of, say, a water droplet. A water droplet, it's able to have this roughly round shape because all the little water molecules on the surface of the water droplet, and here the surface might even be on the bottom of the water droplet. They are more attracted to each other than they are to the surrounding air, so they're able to form this type of a shape. You might've seen it if you go to a pond or a stream sometimes, so you see some still water. And let's say, let me do this in blue. So let's say that this is the surface of the water right over here. You might have seen insects that are able to walk on the surface of the water. And I'm not doing a great job at drawing the insects. They don't look exactly like that. But they can walk on the surface of the water. You might've seen or you might've even tried to do something like put a paperclip on the water. And even though this thing is actually more dense than the water and you might expect it to sink, but because of the surface tension, which really forms something of a film on top of the water, the thing won't penetrate the surface, so the paperclip will float, unless you were to push on it a little bit and it allow it to puncture the surface, and then it would actually sink, which is what you would expect because it is actually denser. You'd even see this if you were to take a cup, if you were to take a cup and you were to fill it all the way up to the rim and then a little bit higher, it won't immediately overflow. It won't immediately overflow. If you're very careful, you'll see that you form a bulge here. And that bulges because those individual water molecules are more attracted to each other than they are to the surrounding air. So that allows for something of a little bulge. Obviously if you keep pouring water, at some point, they're just gonna start overflowing because gravity's gonna take over there. Gravity's gonna overwhelm the surface tension. But this bulge will actually form. So surface tension, it is really due to the cohesion of the water. Remember, cohesion is when the molecules are attracted to each other. And it definitely, and especially because they're more attracted to each other than the surrounding air.",science_biology_water-acids-and-bases
"  In the last video we tried to figure out the slope of a point or the slope of a curve at a certain point. And the way we did, we said OK, well let's find the slope between that point and then another point that's not too far away from that point. And we got the slope of the secant line. And it looks all fancy, but this is just the y value of the point that's not too far away, and this is just the y value point of the point in question, so this is just your change in y. And then you divide that by your change in x. So in the example we did, h was the difference between our 2 x values. This distance was h. And that gave us the slope of that line. We said hey, what if we take the limit as this point right here gets closer and closer to this point. If this point essentially almost becomes this point, then our slope is going to be the slope of our tangent line. And we define that as the derivative of our function. We said that's equal to f prime of x. So let's if we can apply this in this video to maybe make things a little bit more concrete in your head. So let me do one. First I'll do a particular case where I want to find the slope at exactly some point. So let me draw my axes again. Let's draw some axes right there. Let's say I have the curve-- this is the curve-- y is equal to x squared. So this is my y-axis, this is my x-axis, and I want to know the slope at the point x is equal to 3. When I say the slope you can imagine a tangent line here. You can imagine a tangent line that goes just like that, and it would just barely graze the curve at that point. But what is the slope of that tangent line? What is the slope of that tangent line which is the same as the slope of the curve right at that point. So to do it, I'm actually going to do this exact technique that we did before, then we'll generalize it so you don't have to do it every time for a particular number. So let's take some other point here.  Let's call this 3 plus delta x. I'm changing the notation because in some books you'll see an h, some books you'll see a delta x, doesn't hurt to be exposed to both of them. So this is 3 plus delta x. So first of all what is this point right here? This is a curve y is equal to x squared, so f of x is 3 squared-- this is the point 9. This is the point 3,9 right here.  And what is this point right here? So if we were go all the way up here, what is that point? Well here our x is 3 plus delta x. It's the same thing as this one right here, as x naught plus h. I could have called this 3 plus h just as easily. So it's 3 plus delta x up there. So what's the y value going to be? Well whatever x value is, it's on the curve, it's going to be that squared. So it's going to be the point 3 plus delta x squared. So let's figure out the slope of this secant line.  And let me zoom in a little bit, because that might help. So if I zoom in on just this part of the curve, it might look like that. And then I have one point here, and then I have the other point is up here.  That's the secant line.  Just like that. This was the point over here, the point 3,9. And then this point up here is the point 3 plus delta x, so just some larger number than 3, and then it's going to be that number squared. So it's going to be 3 plus delta x squared. What is that? That's going to be 9. I'm just foiling this out, or you do the distribute property twice. a plus b squared is a squared plus 2 a b plus b squared, so it's going to be 9 plus two times the product of these things. So plus 6 delta x, and then plus delta x squared.  That's the coordinate of the second line. This looks complicated, but I just took this x value and I squared it, because it's on the line y is equal to x squared. So the slope of the secant line is going to be the change in y divided by the change in x. So the change in y is just going to be this guy's y value, which is 9 plus 6 delta x plus delta x squared. That's this guy's y value, minus this guy's y value.  So minus 9. That's your change in y. And you want to divide that by your change in x. Well what is your change in x? This is actually going to be pretty convenient. This larger x value-- we started with this point on the top, so we have to start with this point on the bottom. So it's going to be 3 plus delta x. And then what's this x value? What is minus 3? That's his x value. So what does this simplify to? The numerator-- this 9 and that 9 cancel out, we get a 9 minus 9. And in the denominator what happens? This 3 and minus 3 cancel out. So the change in x actually end up becoming this delta x, which makes sense, because this delta x is essentially how much more this guy is then that guy. So that should be the change in x, delta x. So the slope of my secant line has simplified to 6 times my change in x, plus my change in x squared, all of that over my change in x. And now we can simplify this even more. Let's divide the numerator and the denominator by our change in x. And I'll switch colors just to ease the monotony. So my slope of my tangent of my secant line-- the one that goes through both of these-- is going to be equal if you divide the numerator and denominator this becomes 6. I'm just dividing numerator and denominator by delta x plus six plus delta x. So that is the slope of this secant line So slope is equal to 6 plus delta x. That's this one right here. That's this reddish line that I've drawn right there. So this number right here, if the delta x was one, if these were the points 3 and 4, then my slope would be 6 plus 1, because I'm picking a point 4 where the delta x here would have to be 1. So the slope would be 7. So we have a general formula for no matter what my delta x is, I can find the slow between 3 and 3 plus delta x. Between those two points. Now we wanted to find the slope at exactly that point right there. So let's see what happens when delta x get smaller and smaller. This is what delta x is right now. It's this distance. But if delta x got a little bit smaller, then the secant line would look like that. Got even smaller, the secant line would look like that, it gets even smaller. Then we're getting pretty close to the slope of the tangent line. The tangent line is this thing right here that I want to find the slope of. Let's find a limit as our delta x approaches 0. So the limit as delta x approaches 0 of our slope of the secant line of 6 plus delta x is equal to what? This is pretty straightforward. You can just set this equal to 0 and it's equal to 6. So the slope of our tangent line at the point x is equal to 3 right there is equal to 6. And another way we could write this if we wrote that f of x is equal to x squared. We now know that the derivative or the slope of the tangent line of this function at the point 3-- I just only evaluated it at the point 3 right there-- that that is equal to 6. I haven't yet come up with a general formula for the slope of this line at any point, and I'm going to do that in the next video. ",math_old-differential-calculus_derivative-intro-dc
" -  Flavia wanted to estimate the mean age of the faculty members at her large university. She took an SRS, or simple random sample, of 20 of the approximately 700 faculty members, and each faculty member in the sample provided Flavia with their age. The data were skewed to the right with a sample mean of 38.75. She's considering using her data to make a confidence interval to estimate the mean age of faculty members at her university. Which conditions for constructing a t interval have been met? So pause this video and see if you can answer this on your own. Okay, now let's try to answer this together. So there's 700 faculty members over here. She's trying to estimate the population mean, the mean age. She can't talk to all 700, so she takes a sample, a simple random sample of 20, so the n is equal to 20 here. From this 20, she calculates a sample mean of 38.75. Now ideally, she wants to construct a t interval, a confidence interval, using the t statistic and so that interval would look something like this. It would be the sample mean plus or minus the critical value times the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of n. And we use a t statistic like this and a t table and a t distribution when we are trying to create confidence intervals for means where we don't have access to the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, but we can compute the sample standard deviation. Now in order for this to hold true, there's three conditions just like what we saw when we thought about z intervals. The first is is that our sample is random. Well, they tell us that here that she took a simple random sample of 20, and so we know that we are meeting that constraint, and that's actually choice A, the data is a random sample from the population of interest, so we can circle that in. So the next condition is the normal condition. Now the normal condition when we're doing a t interval is a little bit more involved because we do need to assume that the sampling distribution of the sample means is roughly normal. Now there's a couple of ways that we can get there. Either our sample size is greater than or equal to 30. The central limit theorem tells us that then our sampling distribution, regardless of what the distribution is in the population, that the sampling distribution actually would then be approximately normal. She didn't mean that constraint right over here. Here, her sample size is only 20, so so far this isn't looking good. Now that's not the only way to meet the normal condition. Another way to meet the normal condition, if we have a smaller sample size smaller than 30 is one, if the original distribution of ages is normal, so original distribution normal, or even if it's roughly symmetric around the mean, so approximately symmetric, but if look at it, this, they tell us that it has right skew. They say the data were skewed to the right with the sample mean of 38.75. So that tells us that the data set that we're getting in our sample is not symmetric, and the original distribution is unlikely to be normal. Think about it. It's not going to be, you're likely to have people who are, you could have faculty members who are 30 years older than this, 68 and three quarters, but you're very unlikely to have faculty members who are 30 years younger than this, and that's actually what's causing that skew to the right. So this one does not meet the normal condition. We can't feel good that our sampling distribution of the sample means is going to be normal, so I'm not gonna fill that one in. Choice C: Individual observations can be considered independent. So there's two ways to meet this constraint. One is is if we sample with replacement. Every faculty member we look at after asking them their age, we say, ""Hey, go back into the pool and we might pick 'em again ""until we get our sample of 20."" It does not look like she did that. It doesn't look like she sampled with replacement, and so even if you're sampling without replacement, the 10% rule says that, ""Look, as long as this is less than ""10% or less than or equal to 10% of the population, ""then we're good,"" and the 10% of this population is 70; 70 is 10% of 700, and so this is definitely less than or equal to 10%, and so it can be considered independent, and so we can actually meet that constraint as well. So the main issue where our t interval might not be so good is that our sampling distribution, we can't feel so confidant that that is going to be normal.",math_ap-statistics_estimating-confidence-ap
" (slow music) -  Where does biodiversity come from? The simple answer to that question is evolution and we could leave it at that. We could all go home because we're done, but that's not going to make much of a video. What we really wanna ask ourselves is what is that? What is evolution and how does it result in biodiversity? I like to think of the study of evolution as following two fairly simply pathways. These paths are pattern and process. Both of these are not only fascinating areas of study, but are crucial in expanding our knowledge of how life originated and how it continues to evolve. The pattern pathway studies the shape of evolution itself by looking at relationships, relationships among organism over time. And to do that, you need to create a diagram or a structure that links these organisms in time showing a branching sequence of relationships much like a family tree or genealogy. These evolutionary trees record not only the relationships among the organisms, but the events that occurred over time that indicate why we think these different organisms are related. Patterns depicted by genealogical trees really are a subject all on their own called phylogenetic systematics. But let's set that aside for a moment. The process path is maybe a slightly better way to start. We want to talk about the mechanisms of evolution. How it actually happens. These are the drivers of the diversity along the multitude of lineages that spring out branching and branching up the tree, up the limbs of the tree of life. Darwin and even some of his predecessors understood this. They could see that things could change. That the pattern of life, this tree, existed, that evolution happened and that the relationships among organisms could be traced by looking at features of those organisms and how they change depending on where they were in the tree. They could see, for example, that the wings of birds, the front legs of mammals and reptiles and, in fact, all the four limbed animals indicated that there was some common relationship there. There was common lineage. But at the same time, you could have change among the branches within those lineages. You could get a change in the front leg to a wing or to a grasping arm. General patterns were evident in everything. But at the time, there wasn't a good understanding of the mechanisms. The processes that could explain how these obviously changing, yet related forms could come about. Darwin and his contemporaries read a lot of stuff about variation, which was visible all around them. It could all be seen. They realized that not all the individuals in a species or even in a population were exact duplicates of each other. This was a surprise to some people, but the evidence was everywhere, even in things as simple as the speed of race horses. If you didn't have variation in how fast horses could run, the races would be pretty boring. Races actually demonstrate how horses were chosen for variations in speed. Humans bred fast horses with each other to get even faster horses and these horses were selected for being the fastest and that's the key word, selection. Darwin thought, hey what if nature worked that way. What if nature selected organisms some how. He noticed that the form and the physiology and the behavior of plants and animals varied within natural populations just as much as they did in domesticated populations of things like horses. Darwin realized that what we're really talking about here are the beginnings of the understanding of the evolutionary mechanism behind evolution, natural selection. Natural selection means that some natural variance, some individuals with different form or physiology or behavior, might be better at getting through life than others. Better that is of gathering food, staying away from predators, turning sunlight into usable energy, resisting wind, having good root systems. In other words, fitting the circumstances of the environment and surviving. What Darwin was really saying is that fitness of an individual meant being better able to produce offspring that had traits like the parent. Traits that would help the offspring be better suited to the conditions of their environment. This has been referred to as survival of the fittest. Actually, I prefer the phrase survival of the fitter because fittest implies that there's an end point, that there's a goal, but there isn't. It's all relative because there are so many compromises and trade offs and being well suited to a place as complex as the natural world that organisms can never reach that perfect match in all respects. This process of the environment selecting variants that are better suited to that environment, no matter how complex is called natural selection. And those traits that make the selected variance better able to survive and reproduce and pass on those traits to future generations are known as adaptations. For example, a wild population of redwood trees might have some individuals that attain greater heights than others and this results in better exposure to sunlight on foggy days enhancing their ability to make food by photosynthesis when a change in the environment such as the fog rolling in, challenges the survival of shorter trees. This in turn not only increases their individual chances for survival, but it also makes available more energy to the taller redwoods to produce more seeds that carry this tallness trait into future generations. So you get natural selection for a tallness trait and an adaptation to an environment that can present changes. Of course, as I mentioned, these simplistic examples kind of skim over the fact that there's always a series of trade offs in nature. We have to consider, for example, that taller trees might have more trouble getting moisture from the roots all the way up to the tips of those highest branches, or that they could be more exposed to storms that could knock them down, or maybe there's some other physiological cause that we might not even have thought of. All these factors are part of a complicated balance that optimizes life to a given environmental situation or set of competing selective factors. Stuff happens. Life is never simple. To me, all these aspects come together to represent the great beauties of life, this constant interplay of processes that results in the complexity of biodiversity, what Darwin called grandeur in this view of life. The flip side of this selection coin is that individuals in a population can also be selected against, because they're less well adapted, sometimes because of susceptibility to diseases or simply by not being good at avoiding being eaten. Something that keeps those individuals from being reproductively successful. You might have noticed by now that there's an important element to this story of variation, selection, and adaptation that's missing here. Darwin noticed it too. He was a very smart guy and he fully recognized that there had to be some way by which organisms could pass on those selected traits, those adaptations to their offspring. It wouldn't work otherwise. There had to be a way that the offspring of individuals that had been selected for could inherit the traits of their successful parents and ancestors. In Darwin's day, there wasn't a good understanding of a mechanism for that. It was only much later that scientists discovered how information is stored in genetic material and passed on to offspring. Today, our detailed understanding of evolutionary processes is built on the discoveries of both Darwin and geneticists. Stepping back now to put it all together, we can see that for all this to work, several different things have to be going on. You have to have variation in nature among the members of a population. You have to have natural forces that can select for or against the enhanced reproduction of individuals who possess certain variations. And you have to have a mechanism by which those selected variations get passed on, inherited by offspring and their future generations. These simple concepts are essentially all you really need for evolution to happen and from these basic principles, we get all the complicated interweavings and interactions among all the factors that become the underlying drivers of Earth's biodiversity.

" -  Let's talk a little bit about the water cycle, which we're all familiar with. In fact, we're all part of the water cycle, every moment of our lives. We might not fully appreciate it. So let's just jump in the cycle. I'll start with evaporation. So we could start with the surface of the ocean here, or this river, or this lake. And at any given moment, there's going to be water evaporating off of that surface. Water molecules that were in their liquid state, liquid state, they just have enough energy to bounce away and go into the gas state. And water in a gaseous state we call vapor, water vapor. Water, water vapor. And so that water vapor, it is going to rise, likely with the air that has been heated on the surface, due to the sun, and there's other more complex dynamics at play, but as it rises, and as the overall temperature cools, that water vapor will condense into little droplets. It'll condense around little, tiny air particles, little particles of dust that you can't even see with your eye, and that's what forms clouds. So this is little droplets, so the water's actually back to the liquid form, they're not individual water molecules anymore, they're now able to interact with each other, and they're condensing around these little, microscopic dust particles to form these water droplets. And if it's cold enough, they might also form small ice crystals, and that's what clouds are. And we see here, they're talking about transportation, you can have these clouds, we obviously, if you look outside and you see clouds, those clouds are moving with the wind. And so they could be moving all of those droplets with the overall wind. And when those droplets get heavy enough, they will precipitate, they will precipitate down. Now they could precipitate back into where we started, they could go back to the ocean there. Or you could go onto a mountain here, and since if the air is cold enough, and if you have the right conditions, that precipitation might be snow, and it might stay snow right over there. Or ice, but then eventually things might warm up, or they might not warm up, but if they do warm up, well, then, they would melt, and there would be snow melt run-off. And that's what you're seeing there. If that rain is falling in this area, so let's say it's not cold enough for it to be snow, we are talking about rain. Well, most of that water is actually going to percolate down into the soil. So most of it goes down. We look around us and we see these rivers and lakes, and we say wow, there's a lot of water there. But it turns out, there's actually a lot more water inside the ground and obviously, in the ocean. And we'll talk about that in a little bit. So you have all of this water that forms in these underground aquafiers here. But some of it also ends up in these lakes and these lakes are usually in a situation where the ground is either already saturated with water, or there's the right types of rocks, so it can contain the water up here, and similarly, rivers are formed by runoff, it's snow melt run-off can famously form rivers. And in general, if you see a creek or a river near your house, especially when it rains it fills up, that's a good indication that the ground water's already saturated and so things are running off into that river. And so that in general is the water cycle. You have evaporation, it condenses into clouds, it eventually precipitates, and it keeps going, round and round and round. Now of course, there's others actors at play. You have things like plants. Plants will take up water from the upper soil, as far as the plant's roots go. And it will use that water to transport nutrients down from the soil up into the leaves. It also uses that water as part of the photosynthesis process that we've studied in many videos. And a lot of that water gets transpired out. So once again, this is transpiration, essentially, evaporation out the leaves of the water. Over here you see this word sublimation. That's going straight from the solid form of water, ice, into the gas form of water, or water vapor. And this will happen in situations where it's cold and it's very, very, very, very dry. And you have, in general, low pressure. So instead of going into the liquid state, right then the water molecules start just leaving as water vapor. And of course, I said, we're part of it. Well, how are we part of it? We will drink some of this fresh water, our bodies are actually mostly water. The cells in our bodies are 70% water. Everything we study in biology, water is a key environment for all of these things to occur. And then we use that water, and then we will get that water out of our body, and then it continues on as part of this water cycle. Now one thing that I find really interesting, as an organism that is dependent on fresh water, when people say fresh water, we're talking about water without salt, as opposed to salt water. So we really need the fresh water in this lake, or in this river, or we might dig wells, so that we can get the water out of these aquafiers. It actually turns out that very little of the overall water in the world is fresh water. And so let me show you this chart over here. I always knew that, but I didn't fully appreciate how little was fresh water. So of all the water on our planet, 97.5% is salt water, for the most part, in our oceans. Only 2-1/2% is fresh water. And even of that 2-1/2% fresh water, very little of it is what we traditionally associate fresh water, the lakes and the rivers. When I think of fresh water, I'm gonna say oh, let me go to a lake or a river, that's stuff that we could potentially drink. But most of it is actually in glaciers and permanent snow cover. So it's ice, snow, that is just not melting. And it makes you think about what would happen if this stuff were to melt. And then you also have ground water, which we could have access to. That's why people dig wells, so we're talking about, well, ground water includes soil moisture, swamp water, and permafrost. Very little of the water is actually in lakes and rivers, which I personally find fascinating. It wasn't obvious to me before I, frankly, saw this chart. Now another really interesting thing is, how long, on average, water molecules might stay in different parts of this water cycle. Going back here, you can imagine that a water molecule can stay for a very long time in the ocean, especially, you know it's going to be moving around, depending on ocean currents and temperature and all of that, but you can imagine, it could stay in that liquid form in that ocean for a very long time. And maybe it spends a shorter amount of time in a cloud. And people have actually studied this, which I find fascinating. I'd be curious to figure out how they actually got this data. But this is the average residence time for water molecules. And you can see here that water can stay in glaciers and permafrost for a very long time, we're talking it could be up to 10,000 years, and these are all rough numbers. It can stay as ground water anywhere from two weeks, to 10,000 years, I guess, depending on how isolated that ground water is. It could be in the oceans and seas as salt water for 4,000 years, and we can look at all of these, all the way, within living organisms, it'll stay about, on average, a water molecule will last about a week in the atmosphere, so that's getting water vapor, turning into a cloud, precipitating down, on average, one and a half weeks. And once again, these are averages. It doesn't mean that every water molecule will stay exactly one and half weeks in the atmosphere, but it's a pretty interesting thing to think about, and it gives you a little bit more sense of, well, one, where all the water is, and how it all works together with the water cycle.",science_biology_ecology
" -  Let's see if we can take the indefinite integral of sine of x to the fourth dx. And like always, pause the video and see if you can work through it on your own. So if we had an odd exponent up here, whether it was a sine or a cosine, then the technique I would use, so if this was sine to the third of x, I would separate one of the sine of xs out, so I would rewrite it as sine squared x times sine of x, and then I would convert this using the Pythagorean Identity, and then when I distribute the sine of x, I'd be able to use u-substitution. We've done that in previous example videos. You could have done this if it was cosine to the third of x as well, or to the fifth, or to the seventh, if you had an odd exponent. But here we have an even exponent. So what do we do? So the technique we will use, and I guess you could call it a trick, the technique or trick to use is once again you want to algebraically manipulate this so you can use integration techniques that we are familiar with. And in this case we would want to use the Double Angle Identity. The Double Angle Identity tells us that sine squared of x is equal to 1/2 times one minus cosine of two x. So how can I apply this over here? Our original integral is just the same thing as, this is going to be the same thing as the integral of sine of x squared, all of that squared, dx. Now I can make this substitution. So this is the same thing as this, which is of course the same thing as this by the Double Angle Identity. So I could rewrite it as the integral of 1/2 times one minus cosine of two x, and then all of that squared dx. And what is that going to be equal to? That's going to be equal to, let's see. 1/2 squared is 1/4, so I can take that out. So we get 1/4 times the integral of... I'm just going to square all this business. One squared, which is one, minus two cosine of two x plus cosine squared of two x dx. Fairly straightforward to take the indefinite integral, or to take the antiderivative of these two pieces. But what do I do here? Once again I've got an even exponent. Let's apply the Double Angle Identity for cosine. We know that cosine squared of two x is going to be equal to 1/2 times one plus cosine of double this angle, so cosine of four x. Once again just make the substitution. This is going to be equal to... Actually let me just write it this way. 1/4, and maybe I'll switch... I'll just keep it in this color. 1/4 times one minus two cosine two x plus 1/2, I'll just distribute the 1/2. Plus 1/2 plus 1/2 cosine of four x dx. Let's see, I could take this 1/2 and add it to this one, and that's going to get me 3/2, so add those together, I'm going to get 3/2. So let me rewrite this as, I'm in the home stretch really, this is going to be equal to 1/4 times the integral of 3/2 minus two cosine of two x. The derivative of four x is four, so it'd be great if I had a four out here. Let me rewrite 1/2 as four over eight. Really I'm just multiplying and dividing by four. That's one way to think about it. So I could say, plus 1/8 times four cosine of four x. I'm just doing this so that it's... In theory you could do u-substitution, but we've have a lot of practice with this. I have a function, I have its derivative, I could just integrate with respect to the four x right over there. I guess you could say it's the reverse chain rule, which is really what u-substitution is all about. Now I'm ready to integrate. So this is going to be equal to, I think we deserve a little bit of a drumroll, 1/4 times 3/2 x, c-derivative of two x is sitting right over here too, so this is going to be minus sine of two x. We can verify that this is a c-derivative of this. It's going to be two cosine of two x, we have it right over there, plus 1/8 times sine of four x. Derivative of sine of four x is going to be four cosine of four x, which is exactly what we have there. And then home stretch, we just write the plus C, plus sub constant. This is an indefinite integral. And we're all done. This wasn't the simplest of problems, but it also wasn't too bad. And it's strangely satisfying to get it done.",math_old-integral-calculus_integration-techniques
" -  In the last video we began to see some pretty good evidence that DNA was the molecular basis for inheritance and we saw that from the work of Avery, McCarthy and McLead where they tried to identify whether it was DNA or proteins that acted as a transformation principle in Griffith's experiments and I encourage you to watch that video if all of this sounds unfamiliar. But even their work in 1944 was not viewed as conclusive evidence. It was viewed as strong evidence, but not conclusive evidence because, remember how they did it, they took the heat killed smooth strain, the smooth strain you might remember from Griffith's experiment was the virulent one. The heat killed it. When you heat kill it in injected amounts, it didn't do anything to the mouse, but if you took the heat killed smooth strain and put it with the rough strain, it somehow transformed the rough strain in to the smooth strain, in to the virulent strain and so they took the heat killed smooth strain and they took out its different components and they eventually were able to isolate one that was able to transform the rough strain in to the smooth strain by itself and then they applied all sorts of chemical tests to it and said, ""Hey, there's pretty good evidence ""that this is DNA,"" but it wasn't conclusive because, well, maybe they didn't purify it properly or maybe there was still a little bit of protein. Maybe it was mostly DNA, but maybe it was a little bit of protein that was still left there that actually did the transformation. So the scientific community, they weren't just saying, ""Hey, that looks pretty good, ""Let's move on, let's just assume."" They wanted to continue to test it and especially test it in different ways. And, the conclusive evidence didn't come until a few years later, until 1952 when Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase decided to study T2 bacterio phage. Let me write this down. T2 bacterio phage, this is phage that infects bacteria. Bacterio phage. When you hear the word phage, we're referring to viruses. Now they knew that T2 bacterio phage was composed of proteins and DNA and they didn't, well, we now know, that it's a protein shell and there's DNA inside, but they, from their point of view, they said, ""Okay, it's made up and if we try to ""look at the stuff that this virus is made of, ""it's protein and DNA."" So protein plus DNA, and they knew that this virus, when it infects bacteria, it injects something into that bacteria. So it injects something and that something is what hijacks that bacteria's genetic information to start producing more of the T2 bacterio phage. So they could identify the something that gets injected. If they could figure out if that something was either a protein or a virus, then they would have conclusively proven so sorry, if they could show that something was not protein or virus, if it was protein or DNA, if they could show that it was either protein or DNA, then they could show conclusively that it's either the protein or the DNA that forms the molecular basis and so they're actually quite sceptical of Avery, McCarthy and MacLead's experiments. They actually, Hershey and Chase, actually thought that they were gonna show that it was the protein, and remember, this whole time people were like, ""Protein, we know it's these complex molecules ""that have these different shapes ""and all these different amino acids. ""It seems like that's much more likely to encode ""the complexity of genetic information than DNA."" They didn't have an appreciation for the structure of DNA at this time. So they devised an experiment to figure out what is that something that the T2 bacterio phage is infecting. Is that something protein? Is it protein or DNA? So this is the question. So what they do is they take two batches or they developed two batches of T2 bacterio phage. One batch of the T2 bacterio phage they do it in the presence of radioactive phosphorus, phosphorus 32. In the other batch, I should say they grow that T2 bacterio phage in the process of another radioactive isotope, but this time it is of sulfur. This is sulfur 35. So why are they doing that? Well phosphorus is found in DNA. So in this first batch, the radioactive marker, you could say, is going to incorporate itself into the DNA. In the second batch, sulfur is found in the protein and not in the DNA and so this would actually tag the protein parts. And if you're wondering, well, how do you develop these radioactive batches, well, you let the viruses hijack cells in a medium that has either the radioactive sulfur or the radioactive phosphorus and as they reproduce, they are going to incorporate that radioactive material into either the protein or the DNA of the new viruses that get produced. So anyway, they were able to produce some of the T2 bacterio phage in the presence of the radioactive phosphorus and they knew that way that the DNA would get that radioactive material in it and then with the radioactive sulfur they said the protein would have that radioactive sulfur. And then for each of those batches, they then infected bacterio phage with them and they said, okay, they're going to inject something in to the bacterio phage, and to figure out what that something is that was injected in to the bacterio phage they take the products in either of the two scenarios, they first blend 'em up so that all of the stuff that's left outside gets taken off of the surface of the bacteria cells and then they stick it in to a centrifuge and the centrifuge is, you can imagine, it's kind of just a big spinning machine. If you were to take a test tube and take it sideways, one way to think about it, put it sideways like this. Put maybe a stopper in it so nothing leaks and then you spin it around really, really, really, really fast, what you're going to find, you can actually generate significant g forces and so the heavier stuff is going to gravitate to the bottom of the test tube or to the right when it is on its side, and the lighter stuff is going to gravitate to the left. And, it turns out that the bacteria, the actual bacterial cells, those are heavier so the bacterial cells are going to go towards the bottom of the test tube and they're gonna form a material that we call the pellet and then all of the other stuff, all of the fluid and the leftover phage parts those are going to go up to the top of the test tube and we call that the supernatent. I always have trouble pronouncing that. Supernatent. And so they said, ""Look, if we look at the pellet,"" which they knew had the bacterial cells int here or you could even say the remts of the bacterial cells, ""if the pellet here ""contains phosphorus, that means that the DNA, ""our radioactive DNA or our tagged DNA ""made it in to the bacteria, ""but if it contains sulfur, that means that the protein ""made it in to the bacteria."" And, what they found is they found that the radioactive phosphorus was in the pellet which allowed them to conclude that, hey, it's the DNA from the virus that made it inside of the bacteria and not the protein and then they said, ""Well, it must be! ""Wow, the Avery, McCarthy and Maclead were correct. ""It's actually the DNA that is this transformation principle ""that can go in and hijack the genetic, ""the machinery of the bacteria ""to produce more of the actual virus, ""so this is a really, really, really big deal."" Once again, we started with Mendel saying, ""Hey, we have these inheritable factors ""and they seem to segregate and sort in certain ways. ""They seem to be discrete."" Bover and Sutton said, ""Hey, ""chromosomes seem to kind of, ""their behavior during meiosis ""when cells split ""seem to kind of match up to that."" Morgan starts to provide some evidence. We have Griffith's experiments with the mice and the bacteria and saying, ""Hey, look, ""there's some transformation principle."" Avery, McCarthy and MacLeod say, ""Hey, ""looks like when we try to really purify ""this transformation principle, ""it seems like DNA is what really matters."" And then Hershey and Chase validate that even more conclusively.",science_biology_dna-as-the-genetic-material

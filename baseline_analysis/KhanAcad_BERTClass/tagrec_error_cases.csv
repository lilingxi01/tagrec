" -  Let's say we have a linear equation and we know when X is equal to four that Y is equal to nine and we've plotted that point here on our XY plane. Actually, I forgot to label the x-axis right over there. Now let's say we also know, we also know that when X is equal to six Y is equal to one. And we've plotted that point there. And so this green line represents all of the solutions to this linear equation. Now what I want to do in this video is I want to say, well can we find that linear equation and can we express it in both point-slope form and in slope-intercept form. And I encourage you, like always, pause the video and see if you can do it. So let's first think about point-slope form. Point, point-slope form. And point-slope form is very easy to generate if you know a point on the line, or if you know a point that satisfies, where the X and Y coordinates satisfy the linear equation, and if you were to know the slope of the line that represents the solution set of that linear equation. Now for sure we actually were given two points that are solutions, that represent solutions to the linear equation. To fully apply point-slope, or to apply point-slope easily, we just have to figure out the slope. And what we could do is, we could just evaluate well what's the slope between the two points that we know? And we just have to remind ourselves that slope, slope, is equal to, slope is equal to change in y over change in x. Sometimes people say rise over run. And what's that going to be? Well, if we say that this second point right over here, if we say this is kind of our, if we're starting at this point and we go to that point, then our change in Y, going from this point to that point is going to be, it's going to be equal to one minus, one minus nine. One minus nine. This point right over here is the point six comma one. So we started at Y equals nine, we finish at Y equals one, our change in Y is going to be one minus nine. We have a negative eight change in Y, which makes sense. We've gone down eight. So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to negative eight. That's our change in Y. And what's our change in X? Well we go from X equals four to X equals six. So we end up at X equals six and we started at X equals four. We started at X equals four, so our change in X is six minus four, which is equal to two. Which is equal to two. And you could have even done it visually. To go from this point to this point your change in Y, your change in Y is you went down eight. So your change in, let me write this. So your change in Y is equal to negative eight. And what was your change in X? Again to get to this point? Well, your change in X is positive two. So your change in X is equal to two. And so what's your slope? Change in Y over change in X. Negative eight over two is equal to negative four. So now that we have a, now that we know the slope and we know a point, we know a, we actually know two points on the line, we can express this in point-slope form. And so let's do that. And the way I like to it is I always like to just take it straight from the definition of what slope is. We know that the slope between any two points on this line is going to be negative four. So if we take an arbitrary Y that sits on this line and if we find the difference between that Y and, let's focus on this point up here. So if we find the difference between that Y and this Y, and nine, and it's over the difference between some X on the line and this X, and four. This is going to be the slope between any XY on this line and this point right over here. And the slope between any two points on a line are going to have to be constant. So this is going to be equal to the slope of the line. It's going to be equal to negative four. And we're not in point-slope form or classic point-slope form just yet. To do that, we just multiply both sides times X minus four. So we get Y minus 9, we get Y minus nine is equal to our slope, negative four times X minus four. Time X minus four. And this right over here is our classic, this right over here is our classic point-slope form. We have the point, sometimes they even put parenthesis like this, but we could figure out the point from this point-slope form. The point that sits on this line with things that make both sides of this equation equal to zero. So it would be X equals four, Y equals nine, which we have right up there, and then the slope is right over here, it's negative four. Now from this can we now express this linear equation in y-intercept form? And y-intercept form, just as a bit of a reminder, it's Y is equal to MX plus B. Where this coefficient is our slope and this constant right over here allows us to figure out our y-intercept. And to get this in this form we just have to simplify a little bit of this algebra. So you have Y minus nine. Y minus nine is equal to, well let's distribute this negative four. And I'll just switch some colors. Let's distribute this negative four. Negative four times X is negative four X. Negative four time negative four is plus 16. And now, if we just want to isolate the Y on the left hand side, we can add nine to both sides. So let's do that. Let's add nine, let's add nine to both sides. Let's add nine to both sides. On the left-hand side we're just left with Y. And on the right-hand side we're left with negative four X and then 16 plus nine is plus 25. And there you have it. We have the same linear equation, but it's now represented in slope-intercept form. Once again, we see the slope right over here and now we can figure out what the y-intercept is. The y-intercept when X is equal to zero, Y is going to be equal to 25. My axis right here, I haven't drawn it high enough, but if I made it even taller and taller and you see this line is gonna intersect the y-axis when Y is equal to, Y is equal to 25. So there you go, we wrote it in point-slope form, that is that right over there, and we wrote it in Y, sorry, we wrote it in slope, we wrote it in slope-intercept form. Point-slope and slope-intercept. Hopefully you enjoyed that.",math_in-in-grade-11-ncert_in-in-class11-straight-lines
" -  What we have here are two different visualizations of a country's output at different points in time. You might recognize here on the left we have our production possibilities curve for this country. And it's a very simple country that either produces forks and/or spoons. So if it could produce all forks efficiently it would be right here, that many forks. If it could produce all spoons efficiently it would be right here. And all the combinations of forks and spoons that it would produce efficiently at its potential, well that's what defines this production possibilities curve. On the right here we have this country's real GDP versus time. And so you could view their real GDP as some way of computing their aggregate production of spoons and forks. Now we know that real economies do a lot more than just produce two goods. They produce millions of goods and services, but then you would need a graph that would have millions of dimensions which is very hard for most of our brains to understand. But what we have here is, thinking about three different scenarios at three different times for this country. Now we're gonna connect the dots between the visualization on the left, the production possibilities curve, and the visualization on the right. And we're also gonna think about other economic indicators other than real GDP and how those might play out. So let's start off at time T sub one right over here. From what we know of production possibility curves, what is going on in the economy? Pause this video and try to think about that. Well we know that if you're on your production possibilities curve, you're operating at your potential. But here we have a situation where we are operating beyond our potential. This is not a sustainable situation. This is a situation where some people would argue the economy is overheating. This is like if on your personal life if you're pulling all nighters in order to study for a test, that is not a sustainable situation. But at T sub one when you're operating above your potential, it is associated with low unemployment and many would argue unsustainably low unemployment. And because there's so much demand for labor, There's so much demand for utilization of other resources that that could increase price pressure. So it's also associated with higher inflation. Now what would time T sub one, what could that be on this graph here? Well I already depicted it. It could be this point right over here, where our real GDP is above this horizontal red line which you could view as our potential GDP, our full employment GDP, our full employment output. And so this shows that we have a positive output gap just as when we're above or beyond our PPC that is also a positive output gap. Now sometimes we associate this positive output gap being performing beyond the potential as being associated with an expansion versus a recession. And it is indeed the case that this T sub one is happening during an expansion. An expansion is a situation where the GDP is growing. So this is an expansion here. And then if we go from the next trough to the next peak, this is an expansion here. And the opposite of an expansion is a recession, so this is a recession where we're going from a peak to a trough. And if we go from the next peak to the next trough that also would be a recession. So this positive output gap is happening during an expansion. But you could have a situation where you're right here where you have a positive output gap, where you're operating beyond your potential, but the economy has started to shrink. So it's not always the case. Even though positive output gaps get associated with expansions, it's not always during an expansion. But anyway, let's move forward in time. Let's say for various reasons our economy slows down a bit and we go to time T sub two. Now we are actually operating at potential. We are at our productions possibility curve. And so at what point could that be on this graph? Well we have it depicted right here at time T sub two. The country is operating exactly at its potential. The country is operating efficiently in a sustainable way. And then we go to time T sub three. So at time T sub three it's clear that we have a negative output gap and you can see it over here as well. We have a negative output gap. And if you think about the economic indicators other than real GDP what will they be doing? This is a situation where an economy is operating below full employment where the unemployment rate could be elevated, or it's typically elevated when you have this negative output gap. And because both the labor and oftentimes other resources aren't being fully utilized, there might not be a lot of price pressure. So in this situation inflation would be lower. And in extreme cases you could even have negative inflation, which we would call deflation. Now associated with all of these ideas is the idea of economic growth. So in everyday language when people talk about economic growth, they're usually talking about expansions. They're talking about situations where real GDP is growing. But economists, when they talk about economic growth do not mean that. To an economist, economic growth is when the potential of an economy increases. And we know that the only way that the potential of an economy increases is if they all of a sudden have more factors of production, better resources, better technology, the population has increased. So economic growth would be associated with pushing out the actual PPC. So this would, if you saw now they had more technology or more people now, so now that would push out the PBC. And economic growth, for example, if this red line, which is the country's potential, were to increase like this, that would be economic growth. The actual real GDP at any given time would likely cycle around that.",economics-finance-domain_ap-macroeconomics_economic-iondicators-and-the-business-cycle
" - So, check out this problem. You've got a 12 kilogram mass sitting on a table, and on the left hand side it's tied to a rope that passes over a pulley and that rope gets tied to a three kilogram mass. And then on the right side of this 12 kilogram box, you've got another rope and that rope passes over another pulley on the right and is tied to the five kilogram box over here. The question is, what's the acceleration of the 12 kilogram box? Let's make it even harder. Let's say there's a coefficient of kinetic friction between this 12 kilogram box and the table of 0.1. Now you're looking at a really hard problem if you try to solve this the hard way. And by the hard way, I mean using Newton's second law for each box individually and then trying to solve what'd you end up with is at least three equations and three unknowns because you're gonna have three different accelerations. For each of these, you'll have two different tensions cause this left rope is under a different tension from the right rope now. It's only when you have a single rope can you say that it's the same tension. This problem's gonna be hard. There's gonna be tons of Algebra mistakes potentially. And so to avoid that, we can solve this the easy way. And if you remember, the easy way is just by saying, well, let's treat all of these boxes as if they're a single object. And we can do that cause they're all gonna have the same magnitude of acceleration that I'm just calling a system. That's gonna be the magnitude of acceleration of our system. All these boxes will accelerate with the same magnitude. Some may have negative accelerations, some may have positive accelerations like these, but they're gonna all have the same magnitude of acceleration cause we're gonna assume that these ropes don't break. And if they broke, then they'll be different magnitudes or if they stretch, but we're assuming that doesn't happen. And the way we can find this is by just saying, well, if this is just a single object, I don't have to worry about any internal forces, now these tensions become internal forces. And those don't make a system accelerate, only external forces are gonna make a system accelerate. So, all I have to do is find out what are all the external forces that try to make this system go, try to accelerate it, and ones that try to prevent acceleration. I'll call this F external and then I divide by the total mass because this is just simply Newton's second law as if this were one big object. So, what are my external forces? Well, the force that makes it go is gonna be this five kilogram's force of gravity so I'm gonna have a force of gravity over here. That tries to propel the system forward. This is the one that's gonna be driving the system. If I let go of these boxes, it's gonna start shifting in this direction because this five kilogram mass has a larger force of gravity than this three kilogram mass. So, I'm gonna include that as a positive. I'm just gonna define direction of motion as positive, 'cause it's easy. You could do it differently if you wanted to. You could find the other way as positive. So five times 9.8 meters per second squared is how you find this force of gravity. Are there any other forces that are propelling this forward? No, no external forces are. So, are there any forces that are trying to reduce the acceleration? Yeah, there's this force of gravity over here. This force of gravity on the three kilogram mass is trying to prevent the acceleration because it's pointing opposite the direction of motion. The motion of this system is upright and down across this direction but this force is pointing opposite that direction. This force of gravity right here. So, I'm gonna have to subtract three kilograms times 9.8 meters per second squared. Am I gonna have any other forces that try to prevent the system from moving? You might think the force of gravity on this 12 kilogram box, but look, that doesn't really, in and of itself, prevent the system from moving or not moving. That's perpendicular to this direction. I've called the direction of motion, this positive direction. If it were a force this way, if it were a force this way or a force that way it'd try to cause acceleration of the system. This force of gravity just gets negated by the normal force, so I don't even have to worry about that force. So, are there any forces associated with the 12 kilogram box that try to prevent motion? It turns out there is. There is going to be a force of friction between the table because there's this coefficient of kinetic friction. So, I've got a force this way, this kinetic frictional force, that's gonna be, have a size of Mu K times f n. That's how you find the normal force and so this is gonna be minus, the Mu K is 0.1 and the normal force will be the normal force for this 12 kilogram mass. So, I'll use 12 kilograms times 9.8 meters per second squared. You might object, you might say, ""Hey, hold on, 12 times 9.8, that's the force of gravity. ""Why are you using this force? ""I thought you said we didn't use it?"" Well, we don't use this force by itself, but it turns out this force of friction depends on this force. So, we're really using a horizontal force, a force that tries to prevent motion, which is why we've got this negative sign here, but it's a horizontal force. It just so happens that this horizontal force depends on a vertical force, which is the normal force. And so that's why we're multiplying by this .1 that turns this vertical force, which is not propelling the system, or trying to stop it, into a horizontal force which is trying to reduce the acceleration of the system. That's why I subtracted and then I divide by the total mass and my total mass is gonna be three plus 12 plus five is gonna be 20 kilograms. Now, I can just solve. If I solve this, I'll get that the acceleration of this system is gonna be 0.392 meters per second squared. So, this is a very fast way. Look it, this is basically a one-liner. If you could put this together right, it's a one-liner. There's much less chance for error than when you're trying to solve three equations with three unknowns. This is beautiful. When you apply this though, be careful. The acceleration of the five kilogram mass would be negative 0.392 because it's accelerating downward. The acceleration of the 12, we'd call positive 0.392 because it's accelerating to the right and we typically call rightward accelerations positive. And then the three kilogram mass also would have positive .392 because it's accelerating upward.",science_physics_forces-newtons-laws
" -  A food scientist wants to estimate the difference between the mean weights of eggs classified as jumbo and large. They plan on taking a sample of each type of egg to construct a two-sample t interval. Which of the following are conditions for this type of interval? So before I even look at these choices, and they say choose all answers that apply, so it might be more than one, let's just think about what the conditions for inference for this type of interval actually are. So we've done this many times in many different contexts, and so we first of all have the random condition. And that's the idea that each of our samples are random or we are conducting some type of an experiment where we randomly assign folks to one or eggs in this case to one of two groups. In this case we are taking two samples, and we would hope that they are truly random samples. The second is the normal condition, and the normal condition is a little bit different depending on whether we're talking about means or whether we're talking about proportions. The random condition is essentially the same. The normal condition when we're talking about means, remember they're looking at the difference between mean weights of eggs, is you would want your, there's actually several ways to meet the normal condition. One is is if the underlying distribution is normal. The second way is if your sample sizes for each of your samples are greater than or equal to 30. So if your first sample size is greater than or equal to 30 and your second sample size is greater than or equal to 30. Or even if the underlying data you don't know if it's normal or if it isn't normal, and even if you aren't able to meet these, as long as your sample data is roughly symmetric and not skewed heavily in one way or the other, then that also roughly meets the normal condition when we're dealing with means. And then the third condition, and we see this whether we're dealing with means or proportions or differences of means or differences of proportions, is the independence condition. And this is the idea that either your individual observations are done with replacement in both of your samples or that the sample size for both of your samples is no more than 10% of the population. Then you have met this condition. So with that little bit of a review, let's see which of these apply. They observe at least 10 heavy eggs and 10 light eggs in each sample. So this actually is the normal condition when we are dealing with proportions, not for means. So I would rule this out. It's a good distractor choice. The eggs in each sample are randomly selected from their population. Yep, that's the random condition right over there, so I would select that. They sample an equal number of each type of egg. So this is a common misconception, that whether we're dealing with means or proportions, when we're thinking about the difference between say means or the difference between proportions, that somehow your sample sizes have to be the exact same. That is not the case. Your sample sizes do not have to be the exact case. Or do not have to be the exact same. So we would rule this out as well. So right over here, they have listed the random condition. They could've also listed the normal condition and the independence condition.",math_ap-statistics_two-sample-inference
" f is a linear function whose table of values is shown below. And they give us three different x-values and the corresponding f of x values. Which graphs show functions that are increasing faster than f? So when we're talking about increasing faster, we're really talking about a higher rate of change of y with respect to f, or a higher rate of change of the vertical axis with respect to the horizontal axis, which is another way of saying which of these have a steeper slope than the function f? So let's see what the change in our vertical axis is with respect to our change in our horizontal axis. Once again, the Greek letter-- this triangle is the Greek letter delta, which is shorthand for ""change in."" So this is the change in f over the change in x. So we see over here, when x changes by 1, the value of our function changes by positive 5. And it's linear, so that's true. Between any two points, the ratio between our change in f and our change in x is the same. If we go up 1 again, we have plus 1 in the x-direction, we are once again increasing by 5. If you start from this point and go all the way here, so if you go plus 2 along x, you're going to go plus 10 along f. So it would be 10 over 2, which is still 5. So either way, the slope, or the rate of change of the vertical axis with respect to the horizontal axis, is 5 for f. Now, let's see which of these increase faster. Well, a isn't even increasing. So A is decreasing. As x increases, y is decreasing. So that definitely can't be the case. If we look at this one right over here, it looks like-- let's see, if we start over here, if we increase 1 along the x-direction, if our change in x is 1, it looks like our change in y is exactly 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So it looks like for choice B, our slope is exactly 5, or our change in y over change in x is exactly 5. So it's not increasing faster than f. It's increasing the same as f. Now let's look at C. So I'm going to try to find a point where it looks like I have an integer point right over here. So that's the point, negative 3, negative 3. And if I move 1 in the x-direction, it looks like I'm increasing by more than 5. I'm increasing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, it looks like. So this one looks like it has a slope of 8. So this one is increasing faster than f, so we'll circle that right over there. And now let's look at this choice. So if we start right over here-- and I just picked this point because that's at a nice integer coordinate. It's at the point 2, negative 4. If we increase x by 1, then we increase y by 1, 2, 3-- looks like about 3 and 1/2, definitely not 5. In order for it to increase as fast as f, it would have to increase by 5, so it would have to be up here. So it would have to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It would have had to have been up here. The line would've looked something more like that just to match f, much less grow faster than f. So D does not meet the criteria. It is only C.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-linear-equations-functions
" You are by now probably used to the idea of measuring angles in degrees. We use it in everyday language. We've done some examples on this playlist where if you had an angle like that, you might call that a 30-degree angle. If you have an angle like this, you could call that a 90-degree angle. And we'd often use this symbol, just like that. If you were to go 180 degrees, you'd essentially form a straight line. Let me make these proper angles. If you go 360 degrees, you have essentially done one full rotation. And if you watch figure skating on the Olympics, and someone does a rotation, they'll say, oh, they did a 360. Or especially in some skateboarding competitions, and things like that. But the one thing to realize-- and it might not be obvious right from the get-go-- but this whole notion of degrees, this is a human-constructed system. This is not the only way that you can measure angles. And if you think about it, you'll say, well, why do we call a full rotation 360 degrees? And there's some possible theories. And I encourage you to think about them. Why does 360 degrees show up in our culture as a full rotation? Well, there's a couple of theories there. One is ancient calendars. And even our calendar is close to this, but ancient calendars were based on 360 days in a year. Some ancient astronomers observed that things seemed to move 1/360 of the sky per day. Another theory is the ancient Babylonians liked equilateral triangles a lot. And they had a base 60 number system. So they had 60 symbols. We only have 10. We have a base 10. They had 60. So in our system, we like to divide things into 10. They probably liked to divide things into 60. So if you had a circle, and you divided it into 6 equilateral triangles, and each of those equilateral triangles you divided into 60 sections, because you have a base 60 number system, then you might end up with 360 degrees. What I want to think about in this video is an alternate way of measuring angles. And that alternate way-- even though it might not seem as intuitive to you from the get-go-- in some ways is much more mathematically pure than degrees. It's not based on these cultural artifacts of base 60 number systems or astronomical patterns. To some degree, an alien on another planet would not use degrees, especially if the degrees are motivated by these astronomical phenomena. But they might use what we're going to define as a radian. There's a certain degree of purity here-- radians. So let's just cut to the chase and define what a radian is. So let me draw a circle here, my best attempt at drawing a circle. Not bad. And let me draw the center of the circle. And now let me draw this radius. And let's say that this radius-- and you might already notice the word radius is very close to the word radians. And that's not a coincidence. So let's say that this circle has a radius of length r. Now let's construct an angle. I'll call that angle theta. So let's construct an angle theta. So let's call this angle right over here theta. And let's just say, for the sake of argument, that this angle is just the exact right measure so that if you look at the arc that subtends this angle-- and that seems like a very fancy word. But let me draw the angle. So if you were to draw the angle-- so if you look at the arc that subtends the angle, that's a fancy word. That's really just talking about the arc along the circle that intersects the two sides of the angles. So this arc right over here subtends the angle theta. So let me write that down. Subtends this arc, subtends angle theta. Let's say theta is the exact right size so that this arc is also the same length as the radius of the circle. So this arc is also of length r. So given that, if you were defining a new type of angle measurement, and you wanted to call it a radian, which is very close to a radius, how many radians would you define this angle to be? Well, the most obvious one, if you kind of view a radian as another way of saying radiuses, or I guess radii. Well, you say, look, this is subtended by an arc of one radius. So why don't we call this right over here one radian, which is exactly how a radian is defined. When you have a circle, and you have an angle of one radian, the arc that subtends it is exactly one radius long. Which you can imagine might be a little bit useful as we start to interpret more and more types of circles. When you give a degrees, you really have to do a little bit of math and think about the circumference and all of that to think about how many radiuses are subtending that angle. Here, the angle in radians tells you exactly the arc length that is subtending the angles. So let's do a couple of thought experiments here. So given that, what would be the angle in radians if we were to go-- so let me draw another circle here. So that's the center, and we'll start right over there. So what would happen if I had an angle-- if I wanted to measure in radians, what angle would this be in radians? And you could almost think of it as radiuses. So what would that angle be? Going one full revolution in degrees, that would be 360 degrees. Based on this definition, what would this be in radians? Well, let's think about the arc that subtends this angle. The arc that subtends this angle is the entire circumference of this circle. Well, what's the circumference of a circle in terms of radiuses? So if this has length r, if the radius is length r, what's the circumference of the circle in terms of r? Well, we know that. That's going to be 2 pi r. So going back to this angle, the length of the arc that subtends this angle is how many radiuses? Well, it's 2 pi radiuses. It's 2 pi times r. So this angle right over here, I'll call this a different-- well, let's call this angle x. x in this case is going to be 2 pi radians. And it is subtended by an arc length of 2 pi radiuses. If the radius was one unit, then this would be 2 pi times 1, 2 pi radiuses. So given that, let's start to think about how we can convert between radians and degrees, and vice versa. If I were to have-- and we can just follow up over here. If we do one full revolution-- that is, 2 pi radians-- how many degrees is this going to be equal to? Well, we already know this. A full revolution in degrees is 360 degrees. Well, I could either write out the word degrees, or I can use this little degree notation there. Actually, let me write out the word degrees. It might make things a little bit clearer that we're kind of using units in both cases. Now, if we wanted to simplify this a little bit, we could divide both sides by 2. In which case, on the left-hand side, we would get pi radians would be equal to how many degrees? Well, it would be equal to 180 degrees. And I could write it that way, or I could write it that way. And you see over here, this is 180 degrees. And you also see if you were to draw a circle around here, we've gone halfway around the circle. So the arc length, or the arc that subtends the angle, is half the circumference. Half the circumference is pi radiuses. So we call this pi radians. Pi radians is 180 degrees. And from this, we can come up with conversions. So one radian would be how many degrees? Well, to do that, we would just have to divide both sides by pi. And on the left-hand side, you'd be left with 1-- I'll just write it singular now. 1 radian is equal to-- I'm just dividing both sides. Let me make it clear what I'm doing here, just to show you this isn't some voodoo. So I'm just dividing both sides by pi here. On the left-hand side, you're left with 1. And on the right-hand side, you're left with 180/pi degrees. So 1 radian is equal to 180/pi degrees, which is starting to make it an interesting way to convert them. Let's think about it the other way. If I were to have 1 degree, how many radians is that? Well, let's start off with-- let me rewrite this thing over here. We said pi radians is equal to 180 degrees. So now we want to think about 1 degree. So let's solve for 1 degree. 1 degree, we can divide both sides by 180. We are left with pi/180 radians is equal to 1 degree. 1So pi/180 radians is equal to 1 degree. 1This might seem confusing and daunting. 1And it was for me the first time I 1was exposed to this, especially because we're not 1exposed to this in our everyday life. 1But what we're going to see over the next few examples 1is that as long as we keep in mind this whole idea 1that 2 pi radians is equal to 360 degrees, 1or that pi radians is equal to 180 degrees, which is the two 1things that I do keep in my mind. 1We can always re-derive these two things. 1You might say, hey, how do I remember 1if it's pi/180 or 180/pi to convert the two things? 1Well, just remember, which is hopefully intuitive, 1that 2 pi radians is equal to 360 degrees. 1And we'll work through a bunch of examples in the next video, 1to just make sure that we're used 1to converting one way or the other.",math_engageny-geo_geo-5
" In the last video, I told you that if I had a hyperbola with the equation x squared over a squared minus y squared over b squared is equal to 1, that the focal distance for this hyperbola is just equal to the square root of the sum of these two numbers. The square root of a squared plus b squared. In this video I really just want to show you that. And actually, just so you know, this equation right here, this is a particular hyperbola that opens to the left and the right. And that's because those are the asymptote points. Those would be the axis. And that's because the x term is positive. If the y term was positive and the x term had a negative sign, then the hyperbola would open upwards and downwards, like that. And the proof that I'm showing you in this video, it's just a bunch of algebra, really, is identical in the y case, you'd just switch around x's and the y's. But I just wanted to make sure you realize that. That I'm just doing a particular case of hyperbola that opens the left and the right. I could call it a horizontal hyperbola, instead of a vertical one, but I wanted to make it clear there is another type of hyperbola. But anyway, let's draw a graphical representation of all this just to make sure we understand, or we re-understand, or better understand what the foci points are and where they sit on the hyperbola So those are my axis. The asymptotes of this hyperbola are the lines y is equal to plus or minus b over a. Oh woops, not using my line tool. So, that's one and that's the other asymptote. then the hyperbola will look something like this. It looks something like that. It's going to intersect at a comma 0, right there. This is going to be a comma 0. And the intersect at minus a comma 0. We saw this in the previous video. It looks something like that. And then the focus points are going to sit out here someplace. There and there. And the focal length this a squared plus b square. The square root of a squared plus b squared. That's just this distance right here. That distance is the focal length. So this is going to be the point f,0 and this is going to be the point minus f,0. Now we learned in the last video that one of the definitions of a hyperbola is the locus of all points, or the set of all points, where if I take the difference of the distances to the two foci, that difference will be a constant number. So if this is the point x comma y, and it could be any point that satisfies this equation, it's any point on the byperbola, we know, or we are told, that if we take this distance right here-- --let's call that d1 --and subtract from that the distance to the high other foci-- call that d2 --that that number is a constant regardless of where we are on the hyperbola. In fact the locus of all points are-- the hyperbole in fact is all of the points that satisfy that condition. And we learned in last video just by taking the difference of the distance, we picked this point and we said, OK, what's that distance minus that distance. And we figured out that it's 2a. So d1 minus d2 is equal to-- I'm going off the video screen --d1 minus d2 is equal to 2a. So let's use this fact right here that d1 minus d2 is equal to 2a, to try to prove this. Right there. So the first thing to do is figure out what d1 and d2. Just using the distance formula. So what's d1? d1 is the distance between this point and this point minus f0. So what you do is we just use the distance formula, which is really just Pythagorean theorem. So it's the difference of the x's. It's the x distance. So it's x minus f squared plus the y distances. y minus 0, so that's just y, squared. Take the square root of that. So that's d1, right there. d1. And we want to subtract from that d2. the difference of the distances, and in this case d1 is definitely bigger than d2. Or you could take the absolute values if you didn't want to worry about that. And so here, we get the square root of x minus f, x minus f squared, plus y squared. What does that equal to? Well, we said that equals to 2a, that equals this distance right here. So that is equal to 2a. Now let's see if we can simplify this at all. Well an interesting thing to do my just to be the put this on the other side of the equation. And this just can get hairy, so I really hope I don't make any careless mistakes. So this becomes-- and I might write small to save space --this becomes x plus f, right, minus minus, squared plus y squared is equal to 2a plus the square root of x minus f squared plus y squared. Now, to get rid of these radicals, let's square both sides of this equation. The left hand side, if you were to square it just becomes x plus f squared plus y squared. And then to square this we have to square the first term, which is 4a squared. Then we multiply the two terms and multiply that by 2, right? We're just taking this whole thing and squaring it, so that's-- and this is just a review of kind of binomial algebra --so this is equal to plus 2a times this times 2 is 4a times the square root of x minus f squared plus y. y squared, I don't want to lose that squared right there. And then we square this term. And this is just multiplying a binomial. So that's equal to-- you just get rid of the radical sign, and I'm just going to be staying in that color for now --that's equal to x minus f squared plus y squared. And already it looks like there's some cancellation that we can do. We can cancel out-- there's a y squared on both sides of this equation --so let's just cancel those out. Subtract y squared from both sides of the equation. And let's multiply this term out. So this right here is x squared plus 2xf plus f squared. And then that is equal to 4a squared plus 4a times the square root of x minus f squared plus y squared. And then multiply this out. Plus x squared minus 2xf plus f squared. And then let's see, what can we cancel out. We have x squared on both sides of this, we subtract x squared from both sides of the equation. We have an f squared on both sides of the equation so let's cancel that out. And let's see, what can we do to simplify it. So we have a minus 2xf and a plus 2xf. Let's add 2xf to both sides this equation or bring this term over here. So if you add 2xf to both sides of this equation-- let's see, my phone is ringing, let me just turn it off --if you add 2xf to both sides of this equation, what do you get? You get 4xf-- remember I just brought this term over this left hand side --is equal to 4a squared plus 4a times a square root of x minus f squared plus y squared. It's easy to get lost in the algebra. Remember all we're doing, just to kind of remind you of what this whole point was, we're just simplifying the difference of the distances between these two points, and then see how it relates to the equation of the hyperbola itself. The a's and the b's. Let's take this 4a put it on this side, so you get 4xf minus 4a squared is equal to 4a times the square root of-- well let's just multiply this out 'cause we'll probably have to eventually --x squared minus 2xf plus f squared plus y squared. That's this just multiplied out. That's the y squared right there. We could divide both sides of this by 4. All I'm trying to do is just simplify this as much as possible, so then this becomes xf minus a squared is equal to a times the square root of this whole thing. x squared minus 2xf plus f squared plus why squared. And now we could square both sides of this equation right here. And then if you square both sides, this side becomes x squared f squared minus 2a squared xf plus a to the fourth. That's this side squared. And that's equal to, if you square the right hand side, a squared times the square of a square root is just that expression, x squared minus 2xf plus f squared plus y squared. This really is quite hairy. And let's see what we can do now. Let's divide both sides of this equation by a squared, and then you get x squared-- I'm really just trying to simplify this as 1much as possible --over a squared minus-- so the a 1squareds cancel out --minus 2xf plus a to the fourth divided a 1square well that's just a squared. 1So a squared is equal to x squared minus 2xf plus f 1squared plus y squared. 1Well good. 1There's something to cancel out. 1There's a mine 2xf on both sides of this equation so 1let's cancel that out. 1Simplify our situation a little bit. 1And let's see, we have. 1so we could do is subtract this x squared from this. 1So you get-- let me rewrite it --so you get x squared 1f squared over a squared minus x squared. 1And let's bring this y to this side of the equation too. 1So minus y squared. 1That's all I did, I just brought that to that side. 1And then let's bring-- and I'm kind of skipping a couple of 1steps, but I don't want to take too long --let's take this a 1and put it on that side equation. 1So we took the x and the y, we subtracted that from 1both sides of the equation. 1So they ended up on the left hand side. 1And then if we subtract a squared from both sides of this 1equation-- this is a fatiguing problem --then you get f 1squared minus a squared. 1I think we're almost there. 1This can simplify to, let's see we can factor 1out the x squared. 1This becomes f squared over a squared minus 11 times x squared. 1I just factor out the x squared there, minus y squared is equal 1to f squared, the focal length squared, minus a squared. 1And let's see, let's divide both sides of the equation by 1this expression right there, and we get-- and this should 1start to look familiar --we get f squared over a squared minus 11, x squared divided by f squared minus a squared minus y 1squared over f squared mine is a squared is equal 1. 1Right, I divided both sides by this, so I just get a 1 1on this right hand side. 1Let's see if I can simplify this. 1If I multiply the numerator and the denominator 1by a squared, right? 1As long as I multiply the numerator and the denominator 1by the same number I'm just multiplying my 1, so I'm 1not changing anything. 1So if I do that, the numerator becomes f-- if I multiply it, 1it becomes f squared minus a squared. 1I'm just multiplying that times a squared. 1And the denominator becomes a squared times f 1squared minus a squared. 1And all that times x squared. 1Minus y squared minus a squared mine is a 1squared is equal to 1. 1This cancels with this. 1And we get something to starting to look like the 1equation of a hyperbola. 1My energy is coming back! 1It seems like I see the light at the end of the tunnel. 1We get x squared over a squared minus y squared over f minus 1a squared is equal to 1. 1Now this looks a lot like our original equation of the 1hyperbola, which was x squared over a squared minus y squared 1over b squared is equal to 1. 1In fact this is equation of the hyperbola but instead set of 1writing b squared, since we wrote it, we essentially said, 1what is the locus of all points where the difference of the 1distances to those two foci is equal to 2a? 1And we just played with the algebra for while. 1It was pretty tiring, and I'm impressed if you've gotten this 1far into the video, and we got this equation, which should be 1the equation of the hyperbola, and it is the equation 1of the hyperbole. 1It is this equation. 1So this is the same thing is that. 1So f squared minus a square. 1Or the focal length squared minus a squared is 1equal to b squared. 1You add a squared to both sides, and you get f squared 1is equal to b squared plus a squared or a squared 1plus b squared. 1Which tells us that the focal length is equal to the 1square root of this. 1Of a squared plus b squared. 1And that's what we set out to figure out in the beginning. 1So hopefully you're now satisfied that the focal length 1of a hyperbola is the sum of these two denominators. 1And it's also truth if it is an upward or vertical hyperbola. 1And if we're dealing with an ellipse, it's the difference of 1these two-- the square root of the difference of 1these two numbers. 1Anyway, I'll leave you there. 1That was an exhausting problem. 1I have to go get a glass of water now.",math_precalculus_conics
" -  We have three different pictures here, and my question to get us warmed up is which of these could represent 20 divided by four? Pause this video and see if you can figure that out. All right, so let's go through each of these. And, actually, let's think about what each of them could represent. So how many total circles do we have in this picture right over here? Let's see, we have one, two, three, four, and then we have four groups of four. So four, eight, 12, 16. So this looks like 16 circles. 16 circles divided into, we could do it as divided into groups of four, or we could actually also view it as divided into four equal groups, because both of those are true. And we see that that is going to be equal to four. So this one over here, it's really representing 16 divided by four, not 20 divided by four. Now, what about this one? Let's see, here, it looks like we have one, two, three, four, five groups of one, two, three, four, five. So this looks like 25 circles divided into groups of five, or divided into five equals groups, which is, of course, equal to five. So this is 25 divided by five, not 20 divided by four. Now, but what about this one? So let's see, we have one, two, three, four, five, and we have, one, two, three, four groups of five. So five, 10, 15, 20. So we definitely have 20 circles there. And we have divided it into four equal groups. We have divided it into four equal groups, and so that's exactly what we're talking about, or what we started talking about. This is 20 divided by four. And you can see, when you take 20 and divide it into four equal groups, then you get one, two, three, four, five circles per group. And we're done.",math_arithmetic_arith-review-multiply-divide
" -  It is election season, and there is a runoff between candidate A versus candidate B. And we are pollsters. And we're interested in figuring out, well, what's the likelihood that candidate A wins this election? Well, ideally, we would go to the entire population of likely voters right over here, let's say there's 100,000 likely voters, and we would ask every one of the them, who do you support? And from that, we would be able to get the population proportion, which would be, this is the proportion that support, support candidate A. But it might not be realistic. In fact, it definitely will not be realistic to ask, well, all 100,000 people. So instead, we do the thing that we tend to do in statistics is, is that we sample this population, and we calculate a statistic from that sample in order to estimate this parameter. So let's say we take a sample right over here. So this sample size, let's say n equals 100. And we calculate the sample proportion that support candidate A. So out of the 100, let's say that 54 say that they're going to support candidate A. So the sample proportion here is 0.54. And just to appreciate that we're not always going to get 0.54, there could've been a situation where we sampled a different 100, and we would've maybe gotten a different sample proportion. Maybe in that one, we got 0.58. And we already have the tools in statistics to think about this, the distribution of the possible sample proportions we could get. We've talked about it when we thought about sampling distributions. So you could have the sampling distribution of the sample proportions, of the sample proportions, proportions. And it's going, this distribution's going to be specific to what our sample size is, for n is equal to 100. And so we can describe the possible sample proportions we could get and their likelihoods with this sampling distribution. So let me do that. So it would look something like this. Because our sample size is so much smaller than the population, it's way less than 10%, we can assume that each person we're asking, that it's approximately independent. Also, if we make the assumption that the true proportion isn't too close to zero or not too close to one, then we can say that, well, look, this sampling distribution is roughly going to be normal. So we'll have a normal, this kind of bell curve shape. And we know a lot about the sampling distribution of the sample proportions. We know already, for example, and if this is foreign to you, I encourage you to watch the videos on this on Khan Academy, that the mean of this sampling distribution is going to be the actual population proportion. And we also know what the standard deviation of this is going to be. So, let me, maybe that's one standard deviation. This is two standard deviations. That's three standard deviations above the mean. That's one standard deviation, two standard deviations, three standard deviations below the mean. So this distance, let me do this in a different color, this standard deviation right over here, which we denote as the standard deviation of the sample proportions, for this sampling distribution, this is, we've already seen the formula there. It's the square root of p times one minus p, where p is, once again, our population proportion divided by our sample size. That's why it's specific for n equals 100 here. And so in this first scenario, let's just focus on this one right over here, when we took a sample size of n equals 100 and we got the sample proportion of 0.54, we could've gotten all sorts of outcomes here. Maybe 0.54 is right over here. Maybe 0.54 is right over here. And the reason why I had this uncertainty is we actually don't know what the real population parameter is, what the real population proportion is. But let me ask you maybe a slightly easier question. What is, what is the probability, probability that our sample proportion of 0.54 is within, is within two times two standard deviations of p? Pause the video, and think about that. Well, that's just saying, look, if I'm gonna take a sample and calculate the sample proportion right over here, what's the probability that I'm within two standard deviations of the mean? Well, that's essentially going to be this area right over here. And we know, from studying normal curves, that approximately 95% of the area is within two standard deviations. So this is approximately 95%. 95% of the time that I take a sample size of 100 and I calculate this sample proportion, 95% of the time, I'm going to be within two standard deviations. But if you take this statement, you can actually construct another statement that starts to feel a little bit more, I guess we could say inferential. We could say there, there is a 95% probability that the population proportion p is within, within two standard deviations, two standard deviations of p-hat, which is equal to 0.54. Pause this video. Appreciate that these two are equivalent statements. If there's a 95% chance that our sample proportion is within two standard deviations of the true proportion, well, that's equivalent to saying that there's a 95% chance that our true proportion is within two standard deviations of our sample proportion. And this is really, really interesting because if we were able to figure out what this value is, well, then we would be able to create what you could call a confidence interval. Now, you immediately might be seeing a problem here. In order to calculate this, our standard deviation of this distribution, we have to know our population parameter. So pause this video, and think about what we would do instead. If we don't know what p is here, if we don't know our population proportion, do we have something that we could use as an estimate for our population proportion? Well, yes, we calculated p-hat already. We calculated our sample proportion. And so a new statistic that we could define is the standard error, the standard error of our sample proportions. And we can define that as being equal to, since we don't know the population proportion, we're going to use the sample proportion, p-hat times one minus p-hat, all of that over n. In this case, of course, n is 100. We do know that. And it actually turns out, I'm not going to prove it in this video, that this actually is an unbiased estimator for this right over here. So this is going to be equal to 0.54 times one minus 0.54, so it's 0.46, all of that over 100. So we have the square root of .54 times .46 divided by 100, close my parentheses, Enter. So if I round to the nearest hundredth, it's going to be, actually, even if I round to the nearest thousandth, it's going to be approximately 5/100. So this is going to be, this is approximately 0.05. So another way to say all of these things is, instead, we don't know exactly this, but now we have an estimate for it. So we could now say with 95% confidence, and that will often be known as our confidence level right over here, with 95% confidence between, between, and so we'd want to go two standard errors below our sample proportion that we just happened to calculate. So that would be 0.54 minus two times 5/100. So that would be 0.54 minus 10/100, which would be 0.44. And we'd also want to go two standard errors above the sample proportion. So that would be that plus 10/100. And 0.64 of voters, of voters support, support A. And so this interval that we have right over here, from 0.44 to 0.64, this will be known as our confidence interval, confidence interval. And this will change, not just in the starting point and the end point, but it will change the actual length of our confidence interval, will change depending on what sample proportion we happened to pick for that sample of 100. A related idea to the confidence interval is this notion of margin of error, margin of error. And for this particular case, for this particular sample, our margin of error, because we care about 95% confidence, so that would be two standard errors. So our margin of error here is two times our standard error, would just be 0.1 or 0.10. And so we're going one margin of error above our sample proportion right over here 1and one margin of error 1below our sample proportion right over here 1to define our confidence interval. 1And as I mentioned, this margin of error is not going 1to be fixed every time we take a sample. 1Depending on what our sample proportion is, 1it's going to affect our margin of error 1because that is calculated, essentially, 1with the standard error. 1Another interpretation of this is 1that the method that we used 1to get this interval right over here, 1the method that we used to get this confidence, 1to get this confidence interval, 1when we use it over and over, 1it will produce intervals, 1and the intervals won't always be the same. 1It's gonna be dependent on our sample proportion, 1but it will produce intervals 1which include the true proportion, 1which we might not know and often don't know. 1It'll include the true proportion 95% of the time. 1I'll cover that intuition more in future videos. 1We'll see how the interval changes, 1how the margin of error changes. 1But when you do this calculation 1over and over and over again, 195% of the time, 1your true proportion is going to be contained 1in whatever interval you happen to calculate that time. 1Now, another interesting question is, 1is, well, what if you wanted to 1tighten up the intervals on average? 1How would you do that? 1Well, if you wanted to lower your margin of error, 1the best way to lower the margin of error 1is if you increase this denominator right over here. 1And increasing that denominator means 1increasing the sample size. 1And so one thing that you will often see 1when people are talking about election coverage is, 1well, we need to sample more people 1in order to get a lower margin of error. 1But I'll leave you there, 1and I'll see you in future videos.",math_statistics-probability_confidence-intervals-one-sample
" A ball is shot into the air from the edge of a building, 50 feet above the ground. Its initial velocity is 20 feet per second. The equation h-- and I'm guessing h is for height-- is equal to negative 16t squared plus 20t plus 50 can be used to model the height of the ball after t seconds. And I think in this problem they just want us to accept this formula, although we do derive formulas like this and show why it works for this type of problem in the Khan Academy physics playlist. But for here, we'll just go with the flow on this example. So they give us the equation that can be used to model the height of the ball after t seconds, and then say about how long does it take for the ball to hit the ground. So if this is the height, the ground is when the height is equal to 0. So hitting the ground means-- this literally means that h is equal to 0. So we need to figure out at which times does h equal 0. So we're really solving the equation 0 is equal to negative 16t squared plus 20t plus 50. And if you want to simplify this a little bit-- let's see, everything here is divisible at least by 2. And let's divide everything by negative 2, just so that we can get rid of this negative leading coefficient. So you divide the left hand side by negative 2, you still get a 0. Negative 16 divided by negative 2 is 8. So 8t squared. 20 divided by negative 2 is negative 10. Minus 10t. 50 divided by negative 2 is minus 25. And so we have 8t squared minus 10t minus 25 is equal to 0. Or if you're comfortable with this on the left hand side, we can put on the left hand side. We could just say this is equal to 0. And now we solve. And we could complete this square here, or we can just apply the quadratic formula, which is derived from completing the square. And we have this in standard form. We know that this is our a. This right over here is our b. And this over here is our c. And the quadratic formula tells us that the roots-- and in this case, it's in terms of the variable t-- are going to be equal to negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac, all of that over 2a. So if we apply it, we get t is equal to negative b. b is negative 10. So negative negative 10 is going to be positive 10. Plus or minus the square root of negative 10 squared. Well, that's just positive 100, minus 4 times a, which is 8, times c, which is negative 25. And all of that over 2a. a Is 8. So 2 times 8 is 16. And this over here, we have a-- let's see if we can simplify this a little bit. The negative sign, negative times a negative, these are going to be positive. 4 times 25 is 100, times 8 is 800. So all that simplifies to 800. And we have 100 plus 800 under the radical sign. So this is equal to 10 plus or minus the square root of 900, all of that over 16. And this is equal to 10 plus or minus-- square root of 900 is 30-- over 16. And so we get time is equal to 10 plus 30 over 16, is 40 over 16, which is the same thing if we divide the numerator and denominator by 4 to simplify it as 10 over-- or actually even better, divide it by 8-- that's 5 over 2. So that's one solution, if we add the 30. If we subtract the 30, we'd get 10 minus 30. Or t is equal to 10 minus 30, which is negative 20 over 16. Divide the numerator and the denominator by 4, you get negative 5 over 4. Now, we have to remember, we're trying to find a time. And so a time, at least in this problem that we're dealing with, we should only think about positive times. We want to figure out how much time has taken-- how long does it take for the ball to hit the ground? We don't want to go back in time. So we don't want our negative answer right here. So we only want to think about our positive answer. And so this tells us that the only root that should work is 5/2. And we assume that this is in seconds. So this is in 5/2 seconds. I wouldn't worry too much about the physics here. I think they really just want us to apply the quadratic formula to this modeling situation. The physics, we go into a lot more depth and give you the conceptual understanding on our physics playlist. But let's verify that we definitely are at a height of 0 at 5/2 seconds, or t is equal to 5/2. This expression right over here does give us h is equal to 0. So we have-- let's try it out. We have negative 16 times 5/2 squared plus 20 times 5/2 plus 50. This needs to be equal to 0. So this is negative 16 times 25/4 plus-- let's see, if we divide 20 by 2, we get 10. If we divide 2 by 2, we get 1. So 10 times 5 is going to be 50. Plus 50. This needs to be equal to 0. Negative 16 divided by 4 is negative 4. 4 divided by 4 is 1. So you have negative 4 times 25, which is 100. Plus 50-- oh, sorry. Negative 4 times 25 is negative 100. Plus 50, plus 50 again is equal to 0. And so we have negative 100 plus another 100. Well, that's definitely going to be equal to 0. We get 0 equals 0. And it all checks out. We hit the ground after 5/2 seconds. Or another way to think about it is 2.5 seconds. t is equal to 5/2 seconds, or 2.5 seconds.",math_algebra-home_alg-quadratics
" -  You are already likely familiar with the notion that a dollar in the U.S., a U.S. dollar is not necessarily equivalent to one currency unit in another country, say one Euro. And so if you were traveling to that country, and you are holding dollars, and you needed to exchange those dollars into Euros, you'd say, well how many Euros am I going to get for my dollars? Or if you were European, and you had a certain number of Euro, and you said how many dollars am I going to get for my Euros, you would be thinking about the exchange rate. And it's not just about if you're a tourist or you're traveling, it's also very important if you're an importer and exporter. If you make, say cars, in the United States, where all of your costs are in dollars, but you're selling them in Europe where you're getting your money in terms of Euros, and then you have to convert them back to dollars to pay your costs, well the idea of an exchange rate matters a lot. And so, first let's make tangible what an exchange rate even looks like. And there's many different ways of representing it. The first thing to appreciate, if someone says what's the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar, your next reaction should be, with regards to what other currency? So if I said, what's the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar with respect to the Euro, you could express that as one U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar, is equal to how many Euros? And at the time of this video, it's actually 0.87 Euros. Now another way to express this is one Euro, one Euro is equal to how many U.S. dollars? And if you know this first equation, you can figure out the second one. You would essentially just divide both sides by 0.87. If you divide this by 0.87 you get one. If you divide one by 0.87, you are going to get approximately 1.15. And so at the time of this video, 1.15 U.S. dollars is equal to one Euro. Or another way to think about it is, if you took a dollar and 15 cents in the U.S. and convert it to Euros, you would get one Euro. And there's other ways of expressing it. You could say what is the price of a U.S. dollar, so price of the U.S. dollar in terms of Euro, in terms of Euro. So this is, how much would it cost to buy one U.S. dollar in terms of Euros? Well you could just look at this over here, and you could say, well, one U.S. dollar is going to cost 0.87 Euros. Or you could say 0.87 Euros, Euros per U.S., per U.S. dollar. And if you were to go the other way around, if you wanted the price of the Euro, price of the Euro in terms, terms of the U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar, well that would be the other right way around. One Euro would cost $1.15. So this would be 1.15 U.S. dollars, dollars per Euro. Now with all of this out of the way, let's actually do some calculations. Let's imagine that in the United States a yellow box goes for $20. These yellow boxes are in high demand. Someone from Europe wants to buy one of these yellow boxes, and they need to buy it for 20 U.S. dollars, but they only have Euro. How many Euro would they need in order to buy that box for 20 U.S. dollars. Well if one U.S. dollar is equal 0.87 Euros, then 20 U.S. dollars is going to be 20 times as many Euros. So we could say $20 times 0.87 Euro per dollar. This symbol right over here is shorthand for Euro. And so you are going to get, let's see, that would be 17, approximately, approximately 17.40 Euro. And if it went the other way around. Let's say that red boxes are available for purchase only in Europe for 20 Euro. An American tourist goes there, and wants to figure out how many U.S. dollars would they have to convert in order to be able to pay for one of these red boxes that are 20 Euro? Well here we see one Euro is equal to 1.15 U.S. dollars. So here you would say 20 Euro times 1.15 U.S. dollars, dollar per Euro, and so what is this going to be? This is going to be 20 times 1.15, which is going to be 23 U.S. dollars. 23 U.S. dollars. Now another idea, a related idea to this, is this notion that currencies can appreciate and depreciate. So let's say that the Euro appreciates, appreciates, and it always matters relative to something. So you say relative to the dollar. So the Euro appreciates relative to the dollar. Come up with an exchange rate that would show the Euro appreciating relative to the dollar with this as a starting point. So one scenario where this is happening is if this was where you are starting, one Euro would now be more U.S. dollars, more than 1.15 U.S. dollars. So you have one Euro, would now be equal to, maybe it's equal to $1.20 now. So it's now equal to $1.20. Now if someone said the dollar appreciates relative to the Euro, then it would go the other way around. That might be one U.S. dollars is now equivalent to .9 Euros, or maybe one Euro, or 1.05 Euros. And similarly, if someone says that the Euro depreciates, depreciates relative, relative to the dollar. That's another way of saying that the dollar has appreciated relative to the Euro. So this could be a situation where if the Euro's depreciating relative to the dollar from this place right over here, one Euro, one Euro is now equal to fewer dollars. And maybe it's now equal to $1.05. And with this as a starting point, this would also be a situation where the dollar has appreciated relative to the Euro. So I'll leave you there. This is a primer on exchange rates. It can get a little bit confusing because you're talking for the price of a currency in terms of another currency. But I encourage you to keep thinking about things. Keep doing these little thought experiments in your head, and thinking about, okay, if a Euro is equal to more than a dollar, if something's worth a certain number of Euros, it should be a larger number in terms of dollars. Similarly, if a dollar is less than one Euro, if something costs a certain number of dollars, it should be a smaller number in terms of Euros.",economics-finance-domain_ap-macroeconomics_ap-open-economy-international-trade-and-finance
" So let's calculate what 2/5 divided by 7/3 is, and I encourage you to pause this video and try to calculate this on your own. Well we just have to remind ourselves that this is going to be the exact same thing as 2 over 5 times the reciprocal of 7/3, which is 3 over 7. And then multiplying two fractions is pretty straightforward. This is just going to be equal to the product of the numerators. So 2 times 3 over the product of the denominators, over 5 times 7-- I'm trying to keep the colors consistent-- which of course is going to be equal to 2 times 3 is equal to 6. And 5 times 7-- I'll do this in a new color, let's see, I haven't used this shade of blue yet-- 5 times 7 of course is equal to 35. So this is equal to 6/35.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-fractions-icse
" We've worked really, really hard to understand PV loops. Now I want to show you how PV loops-- and more specifically, PV boxes-- can be helpful in understanding what's going on in our heart. These are going to be three diagrams. We're going to write out three diagrams. And in all three, we're going to see how PV boxes change shape if we tweak one of three things. So the first thing we can tweak is contractility. The second thing is arterial elastance-- or sometimes we just call that ""Ea."" And the third thing we can tweak to change our PV box is preload. So these are going to be the three ways that we can actually change how the box looks. And I want to actually walk you through exactly will happen if we change it. So let's do contractility first. Let's see how contractility can change our PV box. And to start out, I actually kind of want to show you how I think about these things. I'm drawing a little cement block here. And this cement block is to remind me that the ESPVR line-- remember, this end-systolic pressure-volume relationship-- is going to be fixed in terms of the volume at which it hits the bottom. And the reason for that is that you know that there's a certain minimum volume that you need to be able to get pressure in your left ventricle. And that isn't going to change. So I think of that line as being fixed. And then, there's a second line. Let's say I draw it out right here. And this is my arterial elastance line. And at the bottom of that line-- instead of just letting it hit the baseline-- I'm actually going to show you how I think about it. I think about it as kind of having a wheel. A little wheel. And the reason for that drawing a wheel is to show you that, if I wanted to move it, I could. In this particular case, we're going to leave the wheel alone. We're not going to move it. And we're only going to change contractility. Just try to think about what change in contractility means exactly. Well, what that's going to do is that's going to pivot-- I'm going to write it down here-- pivot the ESPVR line. It's going to cause changes to the ESPVR line. Let's now draw that out. Let's say we actually increase-- so I'll do increase first. Well, actually, maybe, even before doing that, let's actually draw what the pressure volume loop looks like to start out with. I just have to take the two corners. These will be the two corners. And I draw a box that connects the two corners. Right? These are the two corners of my box. It actually looks more like a rectangle than a box, but that's OK. We call them ""boxes"" even though they're sometimes rectangles. And the height of the rectangle is the end-systolic pressure. The width of my box is stroke volume. So stroke volume is kind of how wide it is, and end-systolic pressure is how tall it is. So what's going to happen if I actually now increase-- let's start with increase-- my contractility? Well, increasing contractility means that I pivot that way. And I'm going to write a little plus sign to mean increase. And I have to start at that cinder block because I said it's always fixed. It's not going to move. And I just kind of draw it. Like that. So this is my new line. And to draw the box, I just have to say, well, where does it cross the Ea line-- the arterial elastance line? It crosses at the blue dot. The other corner is going to have the same point as my wheel. Right? I just have to draw a vertical line down and a horizontal line across, and I've got my box. There's my box. And it's a little bit bigger than my green box. And it's increased both the width and how tall it is. Right? So now it's taller and wider. And that means that my stroke volume went up because that's my wideness. That went up. And also, my end-systolic pressure went up. Right? So this length is higher. Both the end-systolic pressure and the stroke volume went up just by increasing the contractility. That's good and easy to remember. Just imagine that line pivoting. And if I wanted to know what happens if I decrease contractility, I could just draw a third line. This would be a decrease in contractility because it's pivoting down. And now, I draw a new dot where the red line and the purple line cross. And I draw a box from there-- just as before-- to my wheel, which is right there. And I say, well, wow. Now my box is smaller. So the amount of stroke work or the area in my box went down, and both dimensions of my box went down. Again, the end-systolic pressure-- I'm not going to write it out, but-- well, I guess I could write it out over here. This is now smaller than the green value. And my stroke volume is actually smaller. This is smaller than it was as well. So both the stroke volume and the end-systolic pressure went down. These are the changes you see with changes in contractility. And remember, it all goes back to pivoting the ESPVR line. By increasing or decreasing contractility, what you're doing is increasing or decreasing the size of the box. Let's move on to arterial elastance. I think the first example is pretty easy. I think you've got it. Let's move on to the second example, and I'm going to draw it kind of the same way with a little cinder block here and a line coming off of it. Let's say the line is something like that. I'm trying to draw it very similar to the first time but probably not identical, I guess. I'll draw a purple Ea line coming like this with the little wheel at the bottom. And again, I'm not going to move the wheel, but I want you to always remember that it could be moved if I wanted to. But in this case, we're not going to move it. What we're going to do instead is we're going to change arterial elastance. And what that does is it pivots-- so just as the other one pivoted, this one also pivots-- this one pivots-- I should probably write an ""s,"" ""pivots""-- the arterial elastance line. So now, instead of pivoting the yellow line, we're going to pivot the purple line. Let me start by drawing my first box, kind of our standard box, just as a point of reference. Right? You need that just to see how things change. You've got to know how things started. So this is my initial PV box. And if I was to pivot things-- let's say I now moved the arterial elastance up. The two ways I could do this, remember, are to increase the heart rate or increase the resistance. Now, if I moved it up like that, then my new line would look something like this. Let's say that would be my new line. Remember, there's still a wheel down here. So that's my new line. And what would my new box look like? The blue line and the yellow line cross right there. So I just have to draw my box using that as my example, and I could do this. This is my new box. And now, if I was to shade the new area, this is kind of the increase area. But there's also kind of a decrease. Right? I also lost a little bit of stroke volume on this side. So I just want to point that out to you. So you do lose some stroke volume, but you gain some end-systolic pressure. So if I was to write the new variables in, you can see the stroke volume's a little tinier than it used to be, but the end-systolic pressure has gone up. So this is different than the first example. In the first example, the entire box basically just got bigger or smaller as contractility went up or down. But now, you're seeing that one dimension goes up-- in this case, the pressure went up-- but the other dimension goes down. That was the stroke volume. And if I was to actually shift it the other way-- let's say I kind of shifted things this way-- now my line pivots that way, and the arterial elastance is lower. Now my new box is actually going to do the opposite. The stroke volume actually increases. And I could finish off this box like that and like that. Now my stroke volume increases because look at this big stroke volume over here. Right? This is a bigger stroke volume than it ever used to be, but the end-systolic pressure went down. This is actually lower than the original green box or the blue box. Here, it's actually a little different. When you pivot the arterial elastance line-- which is what we're doing-- you can actually see that now you're kind of trading off. On the one hand, you can increase pressure if you are willing to get a smaller stroke volume. Or you can do the opposite. You can actually decrease pressure and get a larger stroke volume. So this is actually kind of different than what was happening in the first example. Now, let's move to our third example and see how the pressure volume box will change with preload. So here I'm going to start out the same way as before, kind of drawing my cinder block just to kind of remind myself that this ESPVR line never really shifts. It always stays at one point, even though we know it can pivot. It doesn't roll. I'm going to finally give you an example of what rolling would do. So let's say you have our Ea line with a little wheel here. What preload does is it rolls. Actually, let me change the color there because that's kind of a weird color. Let's do that. It rolls the Ea line. So that's different than what was happening with the pivoting of the Ea line. So when I roll it, what I mean-- I'll show you in just a second-- it's actually going to move the entire line. So this is my initial PV box. Right? Something like this. And if I now decide I want to increase-- 1let's start with increase my preload-- 1then I would basically kind of move things this way. 1You want to draw a plus sign here. 1Now, my new line. 1Let's say it's over here. 1And I'm going to have to draw this as best I can to make sure 1that I maintain the exact same slope because the slope does 1not change. 1And that's my new line. 1And actually, I should probably-- well, yeah. 1Maybe I should do that in a different color just 1to make it very, very clear because I 1don't like having two purple lines. 1It looks too similar. 1So this would be my new blue line. 1And I can also do the opposite and move it in. 1And actually, that would be a decrease in preload, 1and that would actually look like this. 1So you can see that, basically, what 1happens is that the line shifts. 1The entire line shifts, but the slope stays the same. 1So that's what I mean when I say ""rolling"" the line. 1Actually, let's draw out our box to see what that looks like. 1So if I increase preload, then my new box 1basically gets much bigger. 1So my new box is a larger area than my green box. 1Right? 1You can see it's much, much larger. 1Even though there's a little sliver 1of green on the left side, I'm going 1to show you that we have to at least identify. 1You have this bit right here that you lost. 1Right? 1This little bit. 1But overall, you gained much more than you lost. 1So the blue box is definitely bigger. 1And in fact, it's not only bigger 1in stroke volume-- this is definitely larger-- 1but it's also a bigger in end-systolic pressure. 1They both went up. 1A larger preload-- it's not like it would happen forever, 1but within certain limits-- it basically increases your stroke 1volume and increases your pressure. 1And the opposite is true, too. 1So if you decrease your preload, you get a tinier box. 1So basically, this is my small box here. 1And this box I'm going to kind of draw in for you. 1Maybe I'll just color the whole thing in just 1so you can kind of see the area of the small box. 1This red box is obviously much smaller 1than the green box used to be. 1So stroke volume has gone down here. 1It's gotten smaller. 1And end-systolic pressure has also gone down. 1What happens with preload is actually, in some ways, 1kind of similar to what happened with contractility. 1Basically, as you go down in preload, 1the entire box gets smaller, and both dimensions of the box 1get smaller. 1And as preload goes up, the opposite 1happens-- both dimensions, stroke volume 1and end-systolic pressure, go up. 1And the entire box, therefore, goes up. 1And this is quite different than what 1happened in the middle example with arterial elastance, 1where it was more of a trade-off between the two. 1Right? 1In one case, you had a higher stroke volume. 1In the other case, you had a higher end-systolic pressure. 1So this is how you can kind of put it together. 1Just kind of think about two lines. 1It's actually quite simple. 1One of them is fixed. 1The other rolls. 1And then, you can very easily draw out your box. 1And then you can just see what the differences would be.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system
" Let's say I'm walking along some trail and there are some trees on the side of the road. And let's just say these are some plants. And these are the barks of the trees-- maybe I should do it in brown-- but you get the idea. These are some plants that are along the side of the road, or at least the stem of the plant or the bark of the tree. And in the background, I have some mountains. Maybe those mountains are several miles away. We know just from experience that if I'm walking-- let me draw myself over here-- we know that if I'm walking this way, the trees look like they're going past me much faster than the mountains. Like I'll just be going past one tree after another. And they'll just whizz past me-- maybe if I'm running. But the mountains don't seem to be moving that quickly. And this idea, that as you change your position the things that are closer to you seem to move more than the things that are further from you, this property is called parallax. And what we're going to do in this video-- and maybe it's especially obvious if you're driving in a car, then the things close to you are whizzing by you, maybe the curve of the street or whatever, while the things that are further away don't seem to be whizzing by you as fast. What I want to do in this video is think about how we can use parallax to figure out how far certain stars are. And what I want to emphasize is that this method is only good for relatively close stars. We don't have instruments sensitive enough yet to use parallax to measure stars that are really, really, really far away. But to think about how this is done, how we use stellar parallax-- just let me write ""stellar"" up here-- how we use stellar parallax, the parallax of stars, to figure out how far away they are, let's think a little bit about our solar system. So here is our sun in the solar system. And here is Earth at one point in the year. And what I want to do is-- and let's just say this is the North Pole, kind of popping out of the screen here. And so the Earth is rotating in that direction. And I also want to think about a star that is obviously outside of our solar system. And I'm really underestimating the distance to this star. As we'll see, or as you might already know, the distance to the nearest star from our solar system is 250,000 times the distance between the Earth and the sun. So if I wanted to draw this to scale-- well, first of all, the Earth would be this unnoticeable dot here-- but you would also, whatever distance this is, you would have to multiply that by 250,000 to get the distance to this nearest star. Anyway, with that said, let's think about what that star would look like from the surface of the Earth. So let me pick a point on the surface. Maybe if we're thinking about North America, we're right there in the northern hemisphere. So let's take that little patch of land and think about how the position of that star would look. So that's the patch of land. Maybe this is my house right over here, jutting out the side of the Earth. Maybe this is me standing. I'm drawing everything sideways because I'm trying to hold this perspective. So this is me looking up. And let's say at this point in time, the way I've drawn this patch, the sun will just be coming over the horizon. So the sun is essentially at sunrise. So let me do my best at drawing the sun from my point of view. Remember, the Earth is rotating in this way-- the way I've drawn it, it's rotating counterclockwise. But from the surface of the Earth it would look like the sun is coming up here. It's rising in the east. But right at that dawn, on this day when the Earth is right over here, what would that star look like? So if you look at this version of the Earth, the star is kind of skewed a little bit-- not straight up, straight up would be this direction, from the point of view of my house-- it is now skewed a little bit closer to the sun. So if you go in this is zoomed-in version, straight up would look something like that. And maybe based on my measurement, it would look like the star is right over there. So it's a little bit skewed towards where the sun is rising, towards the east relative to straight up. Now let's fast-forward six months so that the Earth is on the other side of its orbit from the sun. So let's fast-forward six months. We're over here. And let's wait for a time of day where we are-- essentially that little patch of the Earth is pointed in the same direction, at least in our galaxy, maybe. And if you think about it, if we go back to this patch of Earth, now the Earth is still rotating in that direction. But now the sun is on the west. The sun is going to be right over here. Maybe I'll do it like this just to make it clear. I'll draw this side of the sun with this greenish color. Obviously the sun is not green, but it will make clear that now we're about the sun is going to be over here. The patch is going to be turning away from the sun. So it'll look to that observer on Earth like the sun is setting. So it'll look like the sun is going down over the horizon. But the important thing is, once we're at this point in the year, what will that star look like? Well, if we have this large diagram, we see that the star, relative to straight up, it is now a little bit to the west now, a little bit more on the side of that setting sun. So the star would now look like it is right there. And if we have good enough instruments, we can measure the angle between where that star was six months ago and where it is now. And let's call that angle 2 times theta. And the reason why I call it 2 times theta-- we could call theta the angle between the star and being straight up. So this would be theta, and that would be theta. And I care about that because if I know theta, and if I know the distance from the Earth to the sun, I can then use a little bit of trigonometry to figure out the distance to that star. Because if you think about it, this theta right over here is the same as this angle. So if this is straight up. That is looking straight up into the night sky. This would be the angle theta. If you know that angle from basic trigonometry, or actually even basic geometry, if you say this is a right angle over here, this would be 90 minus theta. And then you could use some basic trigonometry. If you know this distance right here, and you're trying to figure out this distance, the distance to that nearest star, we could say, look, we need a trigonometric function that deals with the opposite angle of what we know. We know this thing right over here. And the adjacent angle-- we already know this thing right over here. So let me call this the Earth-sun distance, or let me just call this d. And we want to figure out x. So some basic trigonometry-- and you might want to do this if you forget the basic trigonometric functions-- SOHCAHTOA. Sine is opposite/hypotenuse. Cosine is adjacent/hypotenuse. Tangent is opposite/adjacent. So the tangent function deals with the two sides of this right triangle that we can now deal with. So we could say that the tangent of 90 minus theta, this angle right over here-- let me write it-- is equal to the opposite side-- is equal to x over the adjacent side, over d. Or another way, if you assume that we know the distance to the sun, you multiply both sides times that distance. You get d times the tangent of 90 minus theta is equal to x. And you can figure out the distance from our solar system to that star. Now I want to make it very, very, very clear-- these are huge distances. I did not draw this to scale. The distance to the nearest star is actually 250,000 times the distance to our sun. So this angle is going to be super, super, super, super small. So you would need to have very good instruments even to measure-- even to observe-- the stellar parallax to the nearest stars. And we're constantly having better instruments-- and actually the Europeans right now are in the process of a mission called Gaia to measure these to enough accuracy that we can start to measure the accurate distance to stars several tens of thousands of light years away. So that'll start to give us a very accurate map of a significant chunk of our galaxy, which is about 100,000 light years in diameter.",science_cosmology-and-astronomy_stellar-life-topic
" We've got the inequality negative x times the expression 2x minus 14 is greater than or equal to 24. So I encar, encourage you to pause this video now and think about what the solution set to this inequality would actually be, and actually plot the solution set on a number line. So I'm assuming you've given a go at it, so let's just try to simplify this a little bit. So on the left hand side we could distribute, we could distribute this negative x, and so if we did that we would get negative 2, negative 2x squared, negative times a negative is a positive, plus 14x is greater than or equal to 24. Now I'm gonna put the, I'm gonna subtract 24 from both sides, just so that we just have a 0 here and then we can think about factoring what we have here on the left. So we have negative 2x squared, plus 14x, I'm gonna subtract 24 from both sides, so it's minus 24 is greater than or equal to, I've subtracted 24 from the right as well, so that's going to be greater than or equal to 0. Now, I don't like, I don't like having this negative 2 out front, so what I wanna do is I wanna divide this left hand side by negative 2, but I can't just divide the left hand side only by negative 2, I have to do divide the right hand side by negative 2 as well. And anytime I multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, it's going to flip the inequality. So if I divide both sides by negative 2, I'm going to be left with x squared, positive x squared minus, so I'm dividing by negative 2, so minus 7x, plus 12. And now since I divided by negative 2, I'm gonna flip this inequality, is less than or equal to zero divided by negative 2 is 0. So that simplified things a good bit, and now let's see if we can factor this quadratic expression. So two numbers whose product is positive 12, so that means they're gonna have the same sign, and whose, and whose sum is negative 7. So if they have the same sign, and their sum is negative 7, that tells us that they're both going to be negative. And let's see, negative 3 and negative 4 seem to fit the bill. Their product is positive 12. Their sum is negative 7. So we could write this as x minus 3 times x minus 4, is going to be less than or equal to 0. So now this is the point that we're gonna do a little bit of interesting logic. If the product of two things is less than, is less than or equal to 0, what does that tell us, tell what do we know about it? Well, that tells us that either, either one or both of them is 0, or they have different signs. The only way that you're gonna get less than 0 is if one is positive and the other is negative, or one is negative and the other is positive. So our 1 is negative, is that they have different signs. So let's write that down, let's write that down. So either, either x minus 3, x minus 3 is less than or, less than, either x minus 3 is less than or equal to 0 and, and x minus 4 is greater than or equal to 0, x minus 4 is greater than or equal to 0, so notice, note this one is non positive, this one is non negative, they're either equal to 0 or they are have different signs. So that's one situation, or, or the other way around, or x minus 3 is non negative, it's greater than or equal to 0, and x minus 4 is non positive, x minus 4 is less than or equal to 0. Once again, they're either zero or different signs, that's all I'm doing with this little with this little logic work right over here. So what are these, what is this, what is this simplified to? So x minus 3 less than or equal to 0, add 3 to both sides, you get x is less than or equal to 3. And, and x minus 4 is greater than or equal to 0. If you add 4 to both sides of this, you get x is greater than or equal to 4. So what values of x are going to be less than or equal to 3, and greater than or equal to 4? Well anything that's less than or equal to 3 is not going to be greater than or equal to 4 and anything that's greater than or equal to 4 is not going to be less than or equal to 3. So there's no x, there's no x value that can satisfy this situation right over here, there's no X value that will result in this one being negative, and this one being, or this one being non positive and this one being non negative. So let's go to this one right over here. So if we add 3 to both sides, we get x is greater than or equal to 3 and, and we get adding 4 to both sides, x is less than or equal to 4. Now does this make sense, that something could be greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 4? Sure, for example, well 3 is greater than or equal to 3 and is less than or equal to 4, 4 is greater than or equal to 3 and it's less than or equal to 4 and anything in between. So we can plot the solution set here. So this is actually all that matters. Cuz this one, there's no situation which that would've been true. So this is the only thing, this is the only thing that's gonna make this or part true. This part is always going to be false. So if we wanted to make the solution set, it would look something like this. So if this is our possible values of x. So let's say that that is 0, so this is 1, 2, 3, and 4, 3 and 4, 3 and 4, x could be greater than or equal to 3, so it's greater than or equal to 3. But it's also let, it also has to be less than or equal to 4 so we can't just go all past 4. Also, less than or equal, less is since it's, less than or equal we can color in these dots, less than or equal to 4. So anything in this range, including 3 and 4, that's why we circled in the dots, this would satisfy this equation here. And if you wanted to think about it visually, hey, you know we know that this type of thing, we know that this type of thing, or this type of thing, this type of thing right over here, these are, these are parabola's. So how would that relate to this little solution set that we just thought about right over here? Well if you look at let's, let's just look at one of these. Let's say we went to, let's say we went to this form right over here. So all, everything we did, this is just another way of thinking about negative 2x squared plus 14x minus 24 is greater than or equal to 0. So this right over here, we have a negative coefficient on the x squared term, that's going to be a downward opening parabola. So when is that greater than or equal to 0? So if, if we though about the downward opening parabola, it could might look something like this, it might look something like this if we're now thinking in 2 dimensions. And this is the, this is the, if you think of this as the Y axis right over here. So when is that greater than or equal to 0? Well it's greater than or equal to 0, it's above the X axis in this range for x right over here. So that's one way of thinking about it. If we though about it from the point of view, not of that parabola, not of that parabola, but this parabola right over here, when is x squared minus 7x plus 12 less than or equal to 0? Well this is gonna be an up, upward opening parabola. So if it has a positive coefficient here, so this problem might look something like this, might look something like this, when is it less than or equal to 0? Well once again, once again it's less than or equal to 0 in that same range.",math_algebra-home_alg-quadratics
"  At some point in time, you've seen someone walking their dog, and their dog decides to pee on a fire hydrant. Now, this is my attempt to draw a fire hydrant, but you see the dog, and he pees on this fire hydrant. Here's the pee, it's coming, and it splashed all over the place. Why is the dog peeing on the fire hydrant? You might have heard that dogs pee on fire hydrants in order to mark their territory. How exactly is it that they're able to mark their territory? There are particular molecules that are released in the urine, and these molecules can be scented, can be sensed by other animals through their nose. These molecules are known as pheromones, pheromones. Now, we can think of pheromones as specialized olfactory cues. In a previous video, we spoke about how we're able to smell things. Well, pheromones, not only are we able to smell them, and animals in particular are able to smell them, but they also cause some sort of response in the other animal that's smelling them. Basically, we could think of a pheromone as a chemical signal, chemical signal, that is released by one member of a species, so for example, the dog, and is sensed another member of the species, and it triggers an innate response. Pheromones are really important in animals, particularly insects. In insects, they have been linked to mating, to fighting, and also in chemical communications. Bees use pheromones, dogs use pheromones, [unintelligible] use pheromones to mark their territories and basically communicate with other members of the species. This is what pheromones are in a nutshell. Now we're going to go into a little bit of the anatomy and also how, at a molecular level, pheromones work. In a previous video, we went into the olfactory system, and we talked about the olfactory epithelium. Let me just go ahead, and let's imagine that this is the skull of a mouse. Here is a mouse skull, here are its teeth, and here is its nose. This is just the skull. This is the nose. Normally, there would be a little bit of flesh here, but basically, here is the nose, and air comes in, and it moves through the nasal passage, and there is a part of the nasal passage that is known as the olfactory epithelium, so olfactory epithelium. The olfactory epithelium is sensitive to various molecules. There is a specialized part of the olfactory epithelium which is up here in the mouse, and this is known as an accessory olfactory epithelium, accessory olfactory epithelium. The accessory olfactory epithelium actually sends projections to a accessory olfactory bulb. This is the accessory olfactory bulb. The olfactory epithelium sends information to ... [unintelligible] Normal olfactory epithelium sends its information to the olfactory bulb, which is olfactory bulb, but the accessory olfactory epithelium sends information to the accessory olfactory bulb. Let's look at the particular cells in the accessory olfactory epithelium that are responsive to pheromones. Let's look a little bit more closely at the accessory olfactory epithelium. Within the accessory olfactory epithelium, we have a structure known as a vomeronasal system. We got this one zone over here, and then we have beneath it another zone. Let's imagine that this part up here is the nasal passage, so this is the nasal passage, and then over here are all the axons of the various sensory cells that will eventually go to the brain via the accessory olfactory bulb. Within this vomeronasal system, which I will label, vomeronasal system, there are different cells. There are some cells that are situated down here, and they actually send a projection all the way up to this top zone over here. We got these cells in this, since they're situated underneath this bottom zone, are known as basal cells. There are other cells that are over here, and they just have short little projections, and these are known as apical cells. Apical cells are in yellow. This is apical, and this over here is a basal cell. These cells, similar to regular olfactory neurons, will have little receptors at the very tips of their projections, and these receptors will be sensitive to different molecules or pheromones. Let's imagine that in the urine of that dog that peed on the fire hydrant, there is a little molecule. We'll draw it as a little triangle. That triangle will come in, and it might activate a receptor on this basal cell over here. When it does activate this cell, this basal cell will send a axon through the accessory olfactory epithelium and then eventually to the accessory olfactory bulb, so accessory olfactory bulb, and then from there, it will synapse onto a glomerulus and then to a mitral or tufted cell, and then that mitral or tufted cell will send a axon to the brain. There are many of these vomeronasal systems throughout the accessory olfactory bulb here. I just drew one. But basically, again, what we have is we have specialized cells that are responsible with one particular type of molecule that will send little axons that eventually go to the accessory olfactory bulb. All the axons will synapse into one particular location known as a glomerulus. Once these cells reach the accessory olfactory bulb and synapse onto a glomerulus, they will then synapse onto a mitral or tufted cell, and that mitral or tufted cell will actually send a axon to a part of the brain known as the amygdala, amygdala. The amygdala is responsible for a host of things, but it's particularly known for its involvement in emotion and aggression and mating and things like that. So basically, by having various cells respond to various pheromones in the environment, an animal is able to control its behavior via this pathway to the amygdala based on these extracellular cues in the environment. Based on these pheromones, a pheromone will bind, they will cause some kind of cell to fire, and that cell will eventually reach the amygdala to cause a behavioral response in the animal. Now signal transduction, so this part right here, this is where the receptor, the molecule binds to the receptor. This causes a signal to be transduced in the particular sensory neuron. This signal transduction is exactly the same as what happens in regular olfaction, where there is a receptor. The receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor. When that receptor is activated, it causes this cell to de-polarize and fire [unintelligible]. Now interestingly, in humans, we have evolved to, to rely very little on pheromones. We do have a vomeronasal organ. However, we do not have an accessory olfactory bulb, so we rely very little on pheromones.",science_health-and-medicine_nervous-system-and-sensory-infor
" -  In ancient Egypt, women who questioned whether they were pregt or not were told to urinate on bags of wheat and barely over the course of several days. And if the wheat sprouted, the woman was having a girl and if the barley sprouted, she was having a boy, and if neither sprouted, she wasn't pregt. So I guess you could say that the question of ""Am I pregt?"" is as old as time. And the craziest thing about that story is that they tested it in the 60s and they found out that it worked 70% of the time. Okay, so how do we tell if a woman is pregt in the age of modern medicine, so today? Well, there are a few different signs of pregcy and the signs of pregcy are divided into three different groups. So first, there are the presumptive, the presumptive, the presumptive signs of pregcy and these are changes that are experienced by the woman that make her think that she might be pregt. And then the second group of signs are the probable signs. The probable, probable signs of pregcy, which are changes that are seen on physical exam that make the examiner suspect that the woman might be pregt. And then finally, there are the positive signs of pregcy. The positive signs of pregcy, or signs that can only and only be explained by pregcy. Alright, so let's start with the presumptive signs. So we're talking about signs that make the woman think she's pregt. And the number one sign has to be a missed period. And the medical term for that is amenorrhea. The medical term for a missed period is amenorrhea. And if you've heard enough of these Latin words, you may have picked up that putting an A in front of a word means lack of. So this is lack of menses. And you know I think it's really important that you understand why the period is missed in pregcy. So really briefly, over here you have a uterus and the uterus has layers. but the inner most layer, the endometrium, is what we're concerned with right now. And off to the side we have the ovary, which has lots of different follicles in it, and inside each follicle is an egg. So really, just as 50,000 foot view of things, the whole purpose of the menstrual cycle is to select one of these follicles, one of these follicles every menstrual cycle for development. So one of these follicles is selected to grow and develop. And as it does that, as it grows and develops, it secretes hormones, specifically estradiol, so it specifically secretes estradiol, which is a type of estrogen. And that estradiol acts on the uterus and it causes this inner lining of the uterus, the endometrium to proliferate and to become thicker. And then, in the middle of the menstrual cycle, this one mature follicle ruptures and it releases the egg that's inside it. And that event, that event where the follicle ruptures and releases the egg inside of it, is referred to as ovulation. After ovulation, the egg that's released travels down the fallopian tube, hopefully to find a sperm to fertilize it. But meanwhile, this ruptured follicle that's left behind over here, which is now referred to as the corpus luteum, so the corpus luteum takes this sort of waiting period while it's sitting around waiting for the egg to be fertilized to start producing lots of progesterone. So progesterone is another hormone that the corpus luteum produces. And again, the progesterone acts on the endometrium of the uterus to increase the growth of glands and cause the storage of glycogen. And all of this is done to prepare the endometrium, to prepare it for the implantation of an embryo. Alright, so what does any of this have to do with a period? Well, if that egg that's hanging out over there doesn't get fertilized, the corpus luteum recognizes that and it says, ""Well, I guess there's no reason ""to prepare this endometrium for implantation."" So it stops making progesterone. And without the progesterone, the endometrium starts to slough off. And that sloughing off of endometrium is what's referred to as a period. But, if instead the egg does become fertilized, it will implant into the uterus. And when it implants into the uterus, it makes this hormone called human, called human, human chorionic chorionic gonado, gonadotropin, human chorionic gonadotropin. Usually it's just referred to as HCG. And human chorionic gonadotropin tells the corpus luteum to stay alive and to keep making progesterone, and that progesterone in turn keeps the endometrium alive and healthy so that it doesn't slough off and you don't end up with a period. So that is why, when an egg becomes fertilized, when you become pregt, you miss a period. So that's a lot of information. Now, a lot of the hormones that I just talked about account for the other presumptive signs of pregcy. So nausea and vomiting, for example. Lots of people wonder why do you become so nauseous during pregcy and one of the reasons for the nausea is progesterone. So progesterone is really good at relaxing smooth muscle. And that's smooth muscle throughout the entire body, including the smooth muscle of the GI tract. And if you can imagine, if the smooth muscle of the GI tract is relaxed instead of contracting, food isn't gonna make it's way down the GI tract like it should. It kinda just sits there and it's... and that piling up of food, that stasis of food, causes nausea. And, in addition to all of the estrogen and progesterone, the placenta makes a hormone called melanocyte stimulating hormone. It's not the most important hormone of pregcy, but it makes this hormone called melanocyte stimulating hormone which does exactly what the name implies, it stimulates the melanocytes, which are the pigment cells in your skin. So hyper pigmentation is not an uncommon sign in pregcy. So darkening of the skin can also occur as a sign in pregcy. And that could be hyper pigmentation of the face. So the hyper pigmentation of the face is called melasma, and a lot of people refer to it as the mask of pregcy. So you can see dark, blotchy spots on the face which typically go away within a year after the pregcy is over, but still it can be a sign early on in the pregcy. Linea nigra is another manifestation of that hyper pigmentation. So linea means line and nigra means black, right? So it's a dark line that tends to appear down the middle of the abdomen. And also you can see darkening of the areola of the breasts. So that's another manifestation of the hyper pigmentation. And speaking of the breast, many women early on in the pregcy experience breast tenderness. And again, that's due to the effects of estrogen and progesterone causing growth of the glands inside the breast. And then somewhere around 12 to 14 weeks into the pregcy, women can start to experience fetal movements for the very first time and they're commonly described as being flutter-like, so it feels like a flutter. And those movements are referring to as quickening. Quickening. Right, so quickening. So those are the presumptive signs of pregcy. So what about the probable signs of pregcy? Well first there's uterine enlargement. So if the examiner feels an enlarged uterus, that's a pretty big clue that the woman might be pregt. And of course a positive pregcy test is another big sign. So most pregcy tests, whether they're blood tests or whether they're urine tests, detect beta HCG, they detect that human chorionic gonadotropin. And beta HCG is remember, made after the implantation occurs and it can be detected in the urine or in the blood anywhere between 10 to 14 days after conception. And I think there tends to be this thought that blood pregcy tests are way more accurtate than urine tests that are done at home. But that's not necessarily true. So there have been a few studies that have shown that a urine pregcy test is pretty much as accurate as a blood test, but it's improper usage or not correctly following instructions at home that tend to result in an inaccurate home pregcy test. And you might be wondering why a positive pregcy test isn't a positive sign of pregcy. Why is it a probable sign of pregcy? And it's because you can actually have a false positive pregcy test. And because there are certain types of cancer that also produce HCG, so as you can imagine that would also lead to a positive pregcy test in the absence of a pregcy. Alright, now as far as the remainder of the probable signs of pregcy, keep in mind that during pregcy the blood flow to the entire reproductive tract, including the uterus and the vagina drastically increases. There are more blood vessels growing in these organs and more of mom's blood is being directed this way. And that makes these tissues really quite loose and swollen and elastic. So, for example, the tip of the cervix becomes soft and swollen and that can be seen 1or it can be felt by an examiner. 1And that softening of the tip of the cervix 1is referred to as Goodell's sign. 1It's referred to as Goodell's sign, 1so it's something an examiner can see that would 1sort of indicate that the woman might be pregt. 1And all of those blood vessels give the cervix 1and the vagina a violet, bluish color 1which again can be seen during an exam. 1And that's referred to as Chadwick's sign. 1It refers to the bluish tinge 1of the vagina and the cervix. 1And eventually, actually, an examiner 1can feel the presence of the fetus. 1So, there is this maneuver where 1the examiner can insert their finger 1through the vagina and gently tap upwards, 1which causes the fetus to rise. 1And then the fetus sinks and then the examiner 1feels a gentle tap back on their finger. 1And that technique of gently, sort of bouncing 1the floating fetus is referred to as ballottement. 1It's referred to as ballott, 1as ballottement. 1So those are the probable signs of pregcy, 1leaving us with the positive signs of pregcy, 1which are signs that can only and only 1be explained by pregcy. 1So they include visualizing the fetus, 1so direct visualization of the fetus either 1through ultrasound, x-ray. 1Also hearing fetal heart tones. 1Hearing fetal heart tones and feeling fetal movements. 1Feeling fetal movements. 1So visualizing the fetus, hearing 1the fetal heart tones, and feeling fetal movements 1are signs that are absolutely diagnostic of pregcy. 1They can't be explained by anything else. 1Alright, so those are some of the different ways 1we can tell if a woman is pregt, 1which just shows you that we've come a pretty far way 1from the days of urinating on bags of barley and wheat.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" So let's say I have a function of x and y; f of x and y is equal to x plus y squared. If I try to draw that, let's see if I can have a good attempt at it. That is my y axis-- I'm going to do a little perspective here --this is my x axis-- I make do the negative x and y axis, could do it in that direction --this is my x axis here. And if I were to graph this when y is 0, it's going to be just a-- let me draw it in yellow --is going to be just a straight line that looks something like that. And then for any given actually, we're going to have a parabola in y. y is going to look something like that. I'm just going to it in the positive quadrant. It's going to look something like that. It'll actually, when you go into the negative y, you're going to see the other half of the parabola, but I'm not going to worry about it too much. So you're going to have this surface. it looks something like that. Maybe I'll do to another attempt at drawing it. But this is our ceiling we're going to deal with again. And then I'm going to have a path in the xy plane. I'm going to start at the point 2 comma 0. x is equal to 2, y is 0. And I'm going to travel, just like we did in the last video, I'm going to travel along a circle, but this time the circle's going to have of radius 2. Move counter clockwise in that circle. This is on the xy plane, just to be able to visualize it properly. So this right here's a point 0, 2. And I'm going to come back along the y axis. This is my path; I'm going to come back along the y access and then so I look a left here, and then I'm going to take another left here in and come back along the x axis. I drew it in these two shades of green. That is my contour. And what I want to do is I want to evaluate the surface area of essentially this little building that has the roof of f of xy is equal to x plus y squared, and I want to find the surface area of its walls. So you'll have this wall right here, whose base is the x axis. Then you're going to have this wall, which is along the curve; it's going to look something like kind of funky wall on that curved side right there. I'll try my best effort to try to-- it's going to be curving way up like that and then along the y axis. It's going to have like a half a parabolic wall right there. I'll do that back wall along the y axis. I'll do that in orange, I'll use magenta. That is the back wall along the y axis. Then you have this front wall along the x axis. And then you have this weird curvy curtain or wall-- do that maybe in blue --that goes along this curve right here, this part of a circle of radius 2. So hopefully you get that visualization. It's a little harder; I'm not using any graphic program at this time. But I want to figure out the surface area, the combined surface area of these three walls. And in very simple notation we could say, well, the surface area of those walls-- of this wall plus that wall plus that wall --is going to be equal to the line integral along this curve, or along this contour-- however you want to call it --of f of xy,-- so that's x plus y squared --ds, where ds is just a little length along our contour. And since this is a closed loop, we'll call this a closed line interval. And we'll sometimes see this notation right here. Often you'll see that in physics books. And we'll be dealing with a lot more. And we'll put a circle on the interval sign. And all that means is that the contour we're dealing with is a closed contour; we get back to where we started from. But how do we solve this thing? A good place to start is to just to find the contour itself. And just to simply it, we're going to divide it into three pieces and it essentially just do three separate line integrals. Because you know, this isn't a very continuous contour. so the first part. Let's do this first part of the curve where we're going along a circle of radius 2. And that's pretty easy to construct if we have x-- let me do each part of the contour in a different color, so if I do orange this part of the contour --if we say that x is equal 2 cosine of t and y is equal to 2 sine of t and if we say that t-- and this is really just building off what we saw on the last video --if we say that t-- and that this is from t is a greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to pi over 2 --t is essentially going to be the angle that we're going along the circle right here. This will actually describe this path. And if you know, how I constructed this is little confusing, you might want to review the video on parametric equations. So this is the first part of our path. So if we just wanted to find the surface area of that wall right there, we know we're going to have to find dx, dt and dy, dt. So let's get that out of the way right now. So if we say dx, dt is going to be equal to minus 2, sine of t, dy, dy is going to be equal to 2 cosine of t; just the derivatives of these. We've seen that many times before. So it we want this orange wall's surface area, we can take the integral-- and if any of this is confusing, there are two videos before this where we kind of derive this formula --but we could take the integral from t is equal to 0 to pi over 2 our function of x plus y squared and then times the ds. So x plus y squared will give the height of each little block. And then we want to get the width of each little block, which is ds, but we know that we can rewrite the ds as the square root-- give myself some room right here --of dx of the derivative of x with respect to t squared-- so that is minus 2 sine of t squared --plus the derivative of y with respect to t squared, dt. This will give us the orange section, and then we can worry about the other two walls. And so how can we simplify this? Well, this is going to be equal to the integral from 0 to pi over 2 of x plus y squared. And actually, let me write everything in terms of t. So x is equal to 2 cosine of t. So let me write that down. So it's 2 cosine of t plus y, which is 2 sine of t, and we're going to square everything. And then all of that times this crazy radical. Right now it looks like a hard antiderivative or integral to solve, but I we'll find out it's not too bad. This is going to be equal to 4 sine squared of t plus 4 cosine squared of t. We can factor a 4 out. I don't want to forget the dt. This over here-- let me just simplify this expression so I don't have to keep rewriting it. That is the same thing is the square root of 4 times sine squared of t plus cosine squared of t. We know what that is: that's just 1. So this whole thing just simplifies to the square root of 4, which is just 2. So this whole thing simplifies to 2, which is nice for solving our antiderivative. That means simplifying things a lot. So this whole thing simplifies down to-- I'll do it over here. I don't want to waste too much space; I have two more walls to figure out --the integral from t is equal to 0 to pi over 2. I want to make it very clear. I just chose the simplest parametrization I could for x and y. But I could have picked other parametrizations, but then I would have had to change t accordingly. So as long as you're consistent with how you do it, it should all work out. There isn't just one parametrization for this curve; it's kind of depending on how fast you want to go along the curve. Watch the parametric functions videos if you want a little bit more depth on that. Anyway, this thing simplifies. We have a 2 here; 2 times cosine of t, that's 4 cosine of t. And then here we have 2 sine squared sine of t squared. So that's 4 sine squared of t. And then we have to multiply times this 2 again, so that gives us an 8. 8 time sine squared of t, dt. And then you know, sine squared of t; that looks like a tough thing to find the antiderivative for, but we can remember that sine squared of, really anything-- we could say sine squared of u is equal to 1/2 half times 1 minus cosine of 2u. So we can reuse this identity. I can try the t here; sine squared of t is equal to 1/2 times 1 minus cosine of 2t. Let me rewrite it that way because that'll make the integral a lot easier to solve. So we get integral from 0 the pi over 2-- and actually I could break up, well I won't break it up --of 4 cosine of t plus 8 times this thing. 8 times this thing; this is the same thing as sine squared of t. So 8 times this-- 8 times 1/2 is 4 --4 times 1 minus cosine 1of 2t-- just use a little trig identity there --and 1all of that dt. 1Now this should be reasonably straight forward to get 1the antiderivative of. 1Let's just take it. 1The antiderivative of this is antiderivative of cosine 1of t; that's a sine of t. 1The derivative of sine is cosine. 1So this is going to be 4 sine of t-- the scalars don't affect 1anything --and then, well let me just distribute this 4. 1So this is 4 times 1 which is 4 minus 4 cosine of 2t. 1So the antiderivative of 4 is 4t-- plus 4t --and then the 1antiderivative of minus 4 cosine of u00b5 t? 1Let's see it's going to be sine of 2t. 1The derivative of sine of 2t is 2 cosine of 2t. 1We're going to have to have a minus sign there, and put a 2 1there, and now it should work out. 1What's the derivative of minus 2 sine of t? 1Take the derivative of the inside 2 times 1minus 2 is minus 4. 1And the derivative of sine of 2t with respect to 12t is cosine of 2t. 1So there we go; we've figured out our antiderivative. 1Now we evaluate it from 0 the pi over 2. 1And what do we get? 1We get 4 sine-- let me write this down, for I don't want to 1skip too many --sine of pi over 2 plus 4 times pi over 2-- 1that's just 2 pi minus 2 sine of 2 times pi over 2 sine of 1pie, and then all of that minus all this evaluated at 0. 1That's actually pretty straightforward because 1sine of 0 is 0. 14 times 0 is 0, and sine of 2 times 0, that's also 0. 1So everything with the 0's work out nicely. 1And then what do we have here? 1Sine of pi over 2-- in my head, I think sine of 90 degrees; 1same thing --that is 1. 1And then sine of pi is 0, that's 180 degrees. 1So this whole thing cancels out. 1So we're left with 4 plus 2 pi. 1So just like that we were able to figure out the area of this 1first curvy wall here, and frankly, that's 1the hardest part. 1Now let's figure out the area of this curve. 1And actually you're going to find out that these other 1curves as they go along the axes are much, much, much 1easier, but we're going to have to find different 1parametrizations for this. 1So if we take this curve right here, let's do a 1parametrization for that. 1Actually, you know what? 1Let me continue this in the next video because I realize 1I've been running a little longer. 1I'll do the next two walls and then we'll sum them all up.",math_multivariable-calculus_integrating-multivariable-functions
" Let's do another states of matter phase change problem. And we'll deal with water again. But this one hopefully will stretch our neurons a little bit further. So let's say I have 500 grams of water. Of liquid water. At 60 degrees Celsius. Now my goal is to get it to zero degrees Celsius. And the way I'm going to do it is, I'm going to put ice into this 500 grams of water. And my ice machine at home makes ice that comes out of the machine at minus 10 degrees Celsius ice. And my question is, exactly how much ice do I need? So how much, or how many grams of ice? And I'm going to take the ice out of the freezer and just plop it into my liquid. How much do I need to bring this liquid, this 500 grams of liquid water, down to zero degrees? So the idea, if we just imagine a cup here. Let me draw a cup. This is a cup. I have some 60 degree water in there. I'm going to plunk a big chunk of ice in there. And what's going to happen is that heat from the water is going to go into the ice. So the ice is going to absorb heat from the water. So in order for water to go from 60 degrees to zero degrees, I have to extract heat out of it. And we're about to figure out just how much heat. And so we have to say, whatever was extracted out of the water, essentially has to be contained by the ice. And the ice can't get above zero degrees. Essentially, that amount of ice has to absorb all that heat to go from minus 10 to zero. And then also, that energy will be used to melt it a bit. But if we don't have enough ice, then the ice is going to go beyond that and then warm up even more. So let's see how we do this. So how much energy do we have to take out of the 500 grams of liquid water? Well, it's the same amount of energy that it would take to put into zero degrees liquid water and get it to 60 degrees. So we're talking about a 50 degree change. So the energy or the heat out of the water is going to be the specific heat of water, 4.178 joules per grams Kelvin. And I have to multiply that times the number of grams of water I have to cool down, I have to take the heat out of. And we know that's 500 grams. And then I multiply that times the temperature differential that we care about. And just a side note, I use this specific heat because we're dealing with liquid water. Liquid water going from 60 to zero. So the final thing, I have to multiply it by the change in temperature. The change in temperature is 60 degrees. Times 60 degrees. There's a little button on the side of my pen, when I press it by accident sometimes it does that weird thing. So let's see what this is. So this is 4.178 times 500 times change of 60 degrees. It could be a change of 60 degrees Kelvin or a change of 60 degrees Celsius. It doesn't matter. The actual difference is the same, whether we're doing Kelvin or Celsius. And it's 125,340 joules. So this is the amount of heat that you have to take out of 60 degree water in order to get it down to zero degrees. Or the amount of heat you have to add to zero degree water to get it to 60 degrees. So essentially, our ice has to absorb this much energy without going above zero degrees. So how much energy can the ice absorb? Well let's set a variable. The question is how much ice. So let's set our variable, maybe we'll call it I. Let's do x. x is always the unknown variable. So we're going to have x grams of ice. OK, and it starts at minus 10 degrees. So when this x grams of ice warms from minus 10 degrees to zero degrees Celsius, how much energy will it be absorbing? So to go from minus 10 degrees Celsius to zero degrees Celsius, the heat that's absorbed by the ice is equal to-- is equal to the specific heat of ice, ice water, 2.05 joules per gram Kelvin, times the amount of ice. That's what we're solving for. So times x. Times the change in temperature. So this is a 10 degree change in Celsius degrees, which is also a 10 degree change in Kelvin degrees. We can just do 10 degrees. I could write Kelvin here, just because at least when I wrote the specific heat units, I have a Kelvin in the denominator. It could have been a Celsius, but just to make them cancel out. This is, of course, x grams. So the grams cancel out. So that heat absorbed to go from minus 10 degree ice to zero degree ice is 2.05 times 10 is 20.5. So it's 20.5 times x joules. This is to go from minus 10 degrees to zero degrees. Now, once we're at zero degrees, the ice can even absorb more energy before increasing in temperature as it melts. Remember, when I drew that phase change diagram. The ice gains some energy and then it levels out as it melts. As the the bonds, the hydrogen bonds start sliding past each other, and the crystalline structure breaks down. So this is the amount of energy the ice can also absorb. Let me do it in a different color. Zero degree ice to zero-- I did it again-- to zero degree water. Well the heat absorbed now is going to be the heat of fusion of ice. Or the melting heat, either one. That's 333 joules per gram. It's equal to 333.55 joules per gram times the number of grams we have. Once again, that's x grams. They cancel out. So the ice will absorb 333.55 joules as it goes from zero degree ice to zero degree water. Or 333.55x joules. Let me put the x there, that's key. So the total amount of heat that the ice can absorb without going above zero degrees. Because once it's at zero degree water, as you put more heat into it, it's going to start getting warmer again. If the ice gets above zero degrees, there's no way it's going to bring the water down to zero degrees. The water can't get above zero degrees. So how much total heat can our ice absorb? So heat absorbed is equal to the heat it can absorb when it goes from minus 10 to zero degrees ice. And that's 20.5x. Where x is the number of grams of ice we have. Plus the amount of heat we can absorb as we go from zero degree ice to zero degree water. And that's 333.55x. And of course, all of this is joules. So this is the total amount of heat that the ice can absorb without going above zero degrees. Now, how much real energy does it have to absorb? Well it has to absorb all of this 125,340 joules of energy out of the water. Because that's the amount of energy we have to extract from the water to bring it down to zero degrees. So the amount of energy the ice absorbs has to be this 125,340. So that has to be equal to 125,340 joules. We can do a little bit of algebra here. Add these two things. 20.5x plus 333.55x is 354.05x. Is that right? Yeah, 330 plus 30 is 350. Then you have a 3 with a 0.5 there. 354.05x and that is equal to the amount of energy we take out of the water. You divide both sides. So x is equal to 125,340 divided by 354.05. I'll take out the calculator for this. The calculator tells me 125,340, the amount of energy that has to be absorbed by the ice, divided by 354.05 is equal to 354 grams. Roughly; there's a little bit extra. So actually, just to be careful maybe I'll take 355 1grams of ice. 1Because I definitely want my water to be chilled. 1So our answer is x is equal to 354.02 grams of ice. 1So this is interesting. 1I had 500 grams of liquid. 1And you know, intuitively I said, well if I have to bring 1that down to zero degrees, I'd have to have a ton of ice. 1But it turns out, I only need, what was the exact number? 1So the liquid is 500 grams. About, roughly half a pound, 1if you want to get a sense for how much 500 grams is. 1A kilogram is 2.2 pounds. 1So this ice is 354. 1So you actually have to have less ice than water. 1Which is interesting, because it seems like the ice isn't 1making that big of a temperature change. 1The ice is only going from minus 10 to zero degrees. 1While the water is going all the way from 60 degrees to 1zero degrees. 1So you're like, how does that work out? 1And the reason is because so much energy can be absorbed by 1the ice in the form of potential energy as it melts. 1So if you talk about all the energy that the ice is 1asborbing, most of it is due to the heat of 1fusion right there. 1You can actually have zero degree ice and it can still 1absorb this huge amount of energy just by melting it. 1Without even changing its temperature. 1Anyway, hopefully you found that reasonably useful.",science_chemistry_thermodynamics-chemistry
" Mark pedals his bike 70 times in a minute. Which of these are reasonable estimates about Mark's peddling? Mark all that applies. So let's just think about this a little bit. 70 times in a minute. So there are 60 seconds in a minute. So if he's doing 70 times in a minute, if he was doing 60 times in a minute, then he would be peddling once per second. Since he's doing 70 times in a minute, he's doing a little bit more than once per second. So maybe that'll help us right over here. So here it says Mark peddles his bike what? 4,000 times every second. Well, that's nuts. If he peddled his bike 4,000 times every second, you'd have a way huger number right over here. You'd have 4,000 times per second times 60 seconds per minute. You would have a huge number right over here. If it's 70 times in a minute, we just reasoned that he peddles a little over one time in a second. So this is definitely not right. Mark pedals his bike about once every hour. Well, an hour is 60 minutes. So if he does 70 times in a minute, he's going to do 60 times 70 in an hour. So this is also crazy, that he only does once in an hour. This is unbelievably slow. Mark pedals his bike about once every second. Well, we've already reasoned that there's 60 seconds in a minute, and he does 70 times in a minute. So he does a little over-- if you divide 70 by 60, so you could divide 70 by 60, and you're going to get a number that's a little bit over 1 time per second. So this is right. We're estimating. We don't get exact numbers. It's about once every second. So that seems legitimate. Mark pedals his bike about 4,000 times every hour. So let's think about that. If he pedals 70 times in a minute, and then there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is going to be equal to 70 times 60. Well, we can multiply the 7 times the 6, and we get 7 times 6 is 42. And we have two zeroes here. So we have exactly 4,200 times every hour. So as an estimate, this is pretty close. So I would go with that as well.",math_arithmetic-home_multiply-divide
" We're asked to factor 40c to the third power minus 5d to the third power. So the first thing that might jump out at you is that 5 is a factor of both of these terms. I could rewrite this as 5 times 8c to the third power minus 5 times d to the third power. And so you could actually factor out a 5 here, so factor out a 5. And so if you factor out a 5, you get 5 times 8c to the third power minus d to the third power. So as you see, factoring, it really is just undistributing the 5, reversing the distributive property. And when you write it like this, it might jump out at you that 8 is a perfect cube. It's 2 to the third power. c to the third power is obviously c to the third power. And then you have d to the third power. So this right here is a difference of cubes. And actually, let me write that explicitly because 8 is the same thing as 2 to the third power. So you can write this as-- let me write the 5 out front-- 5 times-- this term right over here can be rewritten as 2c to the third power because it's 2 to the third power times c to the third power-- 8c to the third power-- And then, minus d to the third power. And so this gives us, right over here, a difference of cubes. And you can actually factor a difference of cubes. And you may or may not know the pattern. So if I have a to the third minus b to the third, this can be factored as a minus b times a squared plus ab plus b squared. And if you don't believe me, I encourage you to multiply this out, and you will get a to the third minus b to the third. You get a bunch of terms that cancel out, so you're only left with two terms. And even though it's not applicable here, it's also good to know that the sum of cubes is also factorable. It's factorable as a plus b times a squared minus ab plus b squared. So once again, I won't go through the time of multiplying this out, but I encourage you to do so. It just takes a little bit of polynomial multiplication. And you'll be able to prove to yourself that this is indeed the case. Now, assuming that this is the case, we can just do a little bit of pattern matching. Because in this case, our a is 2c, and our b is d. So let me write this. a is equal to 2c, and our b is equal to d. We have minus b to the third and minus d to the third, so b and d must be the same thing. So this part inside must factor out to-- let me write my 5, open parentheses. Let me give myself some space. So it's going to factor out into a minus b. So a is 2c minus b, which is d. So it factors out as the difference of the two things that I'm taking the cube of. 2c minus d times-- and now, I have a squared is 2c squared. 2c squared is the same thing as 4c squared. Let me make that. a squared is equal to 2c-- the whole thing squared, which is equal to 4c squared. So it's 4c squared plus a times b. So that's going to be 2c times d, so plus 2c times d. And then finally plus b squared, and in our case, b is d. So you get plus d squared. And you're done. We have factored it out. And actually, you could get rid of one set of parentheses. This can be factored as 5 times 2c minus d times 4c squared plus 2cd plus d squared. And we are done.",math_algebra-home_alg-polynomials
" -  Alkanes are very unreactive, but they do undergo combustion reactions. So if you take methane and react it with oxygen, you'll get carbon dioxide and water as the products. And for all hydrocarbons, you're gonna get CO2 and H2O as the products of a combustion reaction. Delta H zero for this reaction is negative 890 kiloJoules per one mole of methane which means one mole of methane, if you combust one mole of methane, you're gonna get 890 kiloJoules of heat. And so this is an exothermic reaction, heat is given off. So the heat of combustion is the heat that's released on the complete combustion of one mole of a substance. In this case we're talking about methane. Let's talk about hexane next. Let me draw out the structure for hexane. So we have six carbons and notice we have two CH3 groups, so here's a CH3 and here's a CH3, so CH3 and CH3. And then we have four CH2 groups. So here's one, two, three, and four. So that's why we have a four right here. So there are four CH2 groups in hexane, and here we have the heat of combustion. And now we're gonna talk about the heat of combustion as the negative change in the enthalpy. So negative delta H zero in terms of kiloJoules per mole. That gives us a positive value here, so for hexane it's 4,163 kiloJoules for every one mole of hexane that we combust. Notice what happens as we move on to heptane here. We're increasing in one CH2 group. We're going from four CH2 groups to five CH2 groups. So now we're at five CH2 groups. We get an increase in the heat of combustion, so more heat is released. And that makes sense, if you increase the number of carbons, you're gonna increase in the heat of combustion. So if you increase by one CH2 group, how much do we increase in terms of the heat of combustion? Well, if you take 4,163 and subtract that from 4,817 that's a difference of 654 kiloJoules. The pattern continues when we move on to octane. So octane, now we have 6 CH2 groups. So we've added one more. We've increased our heat of combustion to 5,471 kiloJoules per one mole. And that is also an increase of 654 kiloJoules. So for noe, with one more CH2, we could predict, we could estimate the heat of combusion. And we could just add 654 to 5,471. So we can go ahead and set that up over here. So we have 5,471. We're adding 654 to that. So that would give us a five here, and then seven and five is 12, so we carry the one, and that gives us 11, so we get 6,125. So if I right that in here, 6,125 kiloJoules per mole is a pretty good estimation for the heat of combustion of noe. Heats of combustion are really useful when you're trying to compare the stability of isomers. For example, here we have three isomers: octane, 2-methylheptane, and 2,2-dimethylhexane. So all these molecules have the molecular formula C8H18. So if we write out the combustion reactions, so we have plus O2, we know the products are CO2 and H2O. So we have CO2 plus H2O. Let's go ahead and balance this. We have eight carbons on the left side, so we need an eight over here on the right, we'll put that in front of the CO2. And now let's look at hydrogens. There's 18 on the left, and so we need 18 on the right. And we can do that by putting a nine here, cause nine and two give us 18 hydrogens. Now let's see how many oxygens are on the right side. Well we have eight and 2 give us 16 oxygens here, and then nine gives us nine for the water. So that's a total of 25 oxygens on the right side. So we need 25 oxygens on the left side. Now if we pretend like this two isn't here for a second, we could write a 25 right here, but there is a two, so we need to divide by two. And if we're talking about one mole of C8H18, we're gonna leave this as a fraction, so 25 over two is the amount of oxygen that's necessary to completely react with one mole of C8H18. So now we have our balanced equation for our combustion reaction, and if we compare these three isomers, octane, 2-methylheptane, and 2,2-dimethylhexane in terms of their heats of combustion, we can figure out which one is the most stable isomer. Here we have an energy diagram for our three isomers. So on the left here, we'll put increasing energy this way. All three of our isomers would produce the same products if you combust one mole of them. Each one would give us eight CO2 and nine H2O. So there's an energy level associated with our products. And we'll say this is the energy level associated with our products. It's the same for all three of our isomers. Next we look up the heat of combustion data for the isomers, and this is determined experimentally. For example, octane has a heat of combustion of about 5,471 kiloJoules per mole, so that's how much heat is released, 5,471 kiloJoules per mole. And if we know the energy level of the products, and we know how much energy was released, we can find the energy level of our reactants. So there is the energy level for octane. Next let's think about 2-methylheptane. So again, the energy level of the products is here, and if we look up the heat of combustion for 2-methylheptane we'll find a value somewhere around 5,466. So that's how much energy is released when you combust one mole of 2-methylheptane, 5,466 kiloJoules per mole. Since the energy level of the products is the same as the one before, but we have a smaller heat of combustion this time, that must mean the energy level for 2-methylheptane is lower than the energy level for octane. And finally, we move on to 2,2-dimethylexane. The energy level of the products is the same as before. The heat of combustion is 5,458, so somewhere around 5,458 kiloJoules per mole is released, right? That's how much energy, or heat, is released when you combust one mole of 2,2-dimethylhexane. And since we have a smaller value for the heat of combustion, that must mean the energy is lower for 2,2-dimethylhexane. Now we can finally compare the stabilities of our isomers. The higher the energy, the less stable the compound. So octane has the highest energy level, has the highest heat of combustion. So this is the least stable out of these three, this is the least stable. The lower the energy for our starting compound, the more stable it is. So that must meant that 2,2-dimethylhexane is the most stable isomer out of these three. So now we can think about trends. As we go from octane to 2-methylheptane to 2,2-dimethylhexane we're increasing in branching. So we're increasing in the amount of branching that we have. What happened to the heats of combustion? Alright, if we define heat of combustion as the negative of the change in the enthalpy, the heats of combustion decrease. We went from 5,471 to 5,466 to 5,458. So there was a decrease in the heat of combustion. And what about stability? We got more stable as we branched more. So increased branching in general means increased stability. So it's important to be able to analyze heat of combustion data. Just remember the lower the energy, the more stable the compound. So the compound that had the highest heat of combustion was the least stable. And the compound with the lowest heat of combustion was the most stable. So branched alkanes are lower in energy, or more stable, than straight chain alkanes.",science_organic-chemistry_bond-line-structures-alkanes-cycloalkanes
" Show 109% by shading. So just as a bit of review, 109% if we were to write it out, would literally be 109 percent, which is the same thing as 109 per-- and I could write cent again, but that's getting old. Cent means 100, so it literally means 109 per hundred. If you had 100 per 100, you're dealing with the whole, but now we have more than a whole. We have 109 per 100. We can actually write this as a ratio, or as a fraction. This is the same thing as 109 per 100. It's the the same thing as 109/100. So let's shade that in. So we have a whole here, so we could consider this square a whole. In the last video, we counted. This is a 10 by 10 square. It is cut up into 100 pieces. So if we want 109 of those 100 pieces, what are we talking about? That means we're going to shade in all of the 100 right over here. Let me do that in a new color. So we'll shade in all of this. If you just shaded that in, that would be 100%. That would be 100/100, or 100 per 100, or 100%. I think you're getting the meaning of all of this. I don't just want you just memorize this stuff. This really just means 100 out of 100, or a whole. And you can see that this is the whole square. That's 100 out of 100 right there. The question is saying show us 109% by shading. We already did 100 per 100, but we need to do another 9, so let's shade in another 9. So now we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. So this piece right here, you could almost view that is-- well, that is! That is 9% of an entire square. This is 100% of an entire square. If you considered this whole thing plus this blue area right over here, you are talking about 109% of one whole square.

" - Let's explore Sign Convention in this video. Basically we're gonna talk about the rules that we're going to apply positive and negative signs to measurements. Now you may be having a lot of questions in your mind. As in what measurements are we talking about? Why are we applying signs here all of a sudden? And where are we going to use them? So what we'll do is, we'll first look at what the rules are. Then we'll look at some of the examples. And then, hopefully, you'll kind of, sort of make sense why are we talking about it and where it's going to be useful. And one last thing before we begin. Although in this video we are only going to talk about mirrors. If you are watching this video while studying about lenses. Then the same rules are gonna be applied even for lenses as well. Just wanted to clear that out. And, by the way if you are not studying lenses or you haven't studied them yet don't worry about it. So let's start with the rules, and to understand these rules let's take one example. Let's say we have a concave mirror with us, and by the way this is called a concave mirror because the reflecting side is forming a cave. So what are the rules now? Rule number one, is that all the distances are measured from the pole. We call what pole is. Pole is the center of this mirror. Now when I say all distances, honestly there are only three distances. One is the focal length, how far the focus is. Then object distance, how far the object is. And the image distance, how far the image is. All the three distances are measured always from the pole. That's rule number one which I will not write down. Now rule number two is, when you measure these distances, these distances can be measured either in front of the mirror or it can be measured behind the mirror. To give you an example: Images. Sometimes the images will be formed in front of the mirror. And you may have seen that sometimes it can be formed behind the mirror. So to differentiate between the two distances. We're gonna call one of this measurement as positive. And the other measurement as negative. So the second rule is to figure out which distance then should we call positive. Alright. And let me write this down. The rule is we always chose incident direction as positive. Incident direction is always chosen as positive. So what do we mean by this? Well if we come back over here. Notice that because this is the reflecting side over here, the incident light will always be to the right side. Because, you know you'd keep an object over here and notice where the incident ray would be. Incident ray, if you we're to draw any would always be to the right. And so since incident direction is positive. In this example, right side is positive. And what do we mean by right side? The right side of the pole, because all measurements are done from the pole. So any measurement which is towards the right side of the pole, in this particular example will be positive measurement. And any measurement which you'll do to the left side of the pole will be negative measurement. So to take an example, imagine we are given the focal length of this mirror as two centimeters, everything is in centimeters let's say. There's an object kept at 3.5 centimeters from the pole. And let's say, once we draw ray diagrams we figure out that the image is formed at five centimeters from the pole. These numbers may not be accurate, I don't know. But just take an example. Now let's assign signs to them. Let's start with the object distance. Notice that the object is lying on the negative side. Therefore, this object distance would be negative. Similarly look at the focus. The focus lies on the negative side of the pole. Therefore, this focal length would be negative. Similarly look at the image. The image lies also on the negative side. So here the image distance would be negative. Alright, let's take one more example. And it would be great if you could pause the video, and see if you can try this yourself. So just pause the video and apply signs to these three distances. Remember, incident direction is always chosen as positive. Alright. So incident direction is taken as positive. Over here this is the reflecting side, and our object is over here. So the incident rays will be towards the left. Therefore, you start from the pole and all the measurements to the left are considered as positive this time. Does that make sense? Because you are choosing, because our incident ray is to the left. And all the measurements to the right side now will be negative. And so the object is on the negative side, so it'll get a minus sign. The focal length color you'll notice is on the positive side. The focus is on the positive side, so this focal length is positive. And similarly if you look at the image it's on the positive side. So that image distance will be positive. Alright now there's one more rule. And that rule has something to do with heights. Sometimes when you consider objects and images, the heights will be above the principal axis and sometimes the height will be below the principal axis. Again we'll differentiate between them. We're gonna call as one, one of them as positive. The other one as negative. So again the rule that we're gonna follow with here is you're gonna choose above principal axis or (muffled speaking) I'd like to just say, up is positive. Alright? So if there's any height which is above the principal axis, we'll call it as a positive height. And if there's any height below the principal axis we'll call it as a negative height. So if we knew the height of this object. I don't know, maybe say the height of this object was five centimeters, then that would be a positive height. Alright. And whatever is the height of this image, that will be a negative height. I'm pretty sure You can understand this. Since this object height is above the principal axis it will be a positive height, whatever the height is. And look at the image, again the height is above the principal axis. This will be a positive height as well. And that's it for Sign Conventions. So we have three rules. All the distances are measured from the pole. Then you start from the pole and you go in the incident direction that's chosen as positive. And when it comes to heights. Any height above the principal axis is chosen as positive. And by the way, this rule is given a name, this particular convention that we are following. It's called as the Cartesian Sign Convention. Cartesian Signs. And the word Cartesian might remind you of a graph. And the reason behind it is because that's what we do in graphs as well, right. In graphs we start from the origin. And we choose the right side usually as positive, left side is negative, upwards is positive, downwards is negative. That's basically what we're doing over here as well. We're treating the pole os the origin because you're measuring all the distances from the pole. And instead of choosing right side as positive, the only difference is you are choosing incident direction as positive. That's it. But pretty much everything else is the same as graph. That's why it's called the Cartesian Signs. Now one small thing is that in some textbooks they follow this a little differently. It's pretty much the same so the only different thing that they would do is while drawing the diagrams they will always make sure that the incident direction is drawn to the right. Okay. They will always make sure this is true. Then, automatically the right side will always be positive. Alright. For example they would recommend never to draw like this. Because over here incident direction is to the left. They will always recommend you make sure that your object lies on the left side of the mirror. So we have to flip this whole image. So basically they say that you always draw in such a way that the incident direction is to the right. Alright. And then we can always choose the right side as positive, which is what we do usually in any graph. So it's more aligned to the graphical system. Okay. Now you can follow that, obviously, but in general what I like to remember is you draw however you want. Just take incident direction as positive. So anything you can follow it's pretty much the same thing. So the last thing we'll talk about is, why do we even consider signs? And for that, let's take an example where we've already done this before. So an example of things falling under a gravity. You may recall that whenever things are falling under gravity, usually when an object is falling down we would say it's velocity is negative. And when it's going upwards you would say it's velocity is positive. If we didn't use that sign we might have to explicitly say in English the velocity is downwards, the velocity is upwards. But we don't like that. We want to reduce English and use math as much as possible. So Sign tell us what direction the ball is traveling mathematically. And the idea with here is exactly the same. Without signs we have to explicitly mention we're dealing with a concave mirror, or a convex mirror, or the images in front of the mirror, or the images behind the mirror. But with Signs these things are done mathematically. For example, if I just say negative focal length it automatically means it's a concave mirror. Positive focal length, convex mirror. If I say the object distance, or let's say the image distance is negative automatically it means it's in front of the mirror. It's positive automatically means it's behind the mirror. So long story short, Signs help us differentiate between the directions 1in which you are doing the measurement mathematically.",science_in-in-class10th-physics_in-in-10th-physics-light-reflection-refraction
" So we have two different molecules here. This is hydrogen peroxide. We call it peroxide, because it has this oxygen-oxygen bond. And here we have oxygen difluoride, where oxygen is bonded to two different fluorines. And what I want you to do is pause this video, use this periodic table of elements I have here, and this is more than just a typical information of periodic table of elements. It also gives you the electronegativities of these different elements. And these electronegativities are based on the Pauling scale named after famous biologist and chemist Linus Pauling. And so using the information here and what you know already about oxidation states, think about the oxidation states or the oxidation numbers for each of the constituent elements in these molecules. So pause the video now. So I'm assuming you have given a shot at it. And you might have immediately realized that something very interesting is going on. We've said in the past that because it's two valence electrons away from a full valence shell, because it is so electronegative, oxygen typically takes electrons from other things, typically two electrons, which typically gives it an oxidation state of negative-- an oxidation number or oxidation state of negative 2. This is so electronegative, and it so typically oxidizes other things that we've called the whole phenomenon ""oxidation."" But what's interesting here is that oxygen isn't purely bonded to things less electronegative than itself. And the hydrogen peroxide, yes, it is bonded to the hydrogen. But it's also bonded to another oxygen. And obviously, these two are going to be equally electronegative. So what would be the oxidation states or the oxidation numbers here? Well, hydrogen, once again, we portend-- hydrogen, because it's less electronegative, it would have a partially positive charge, because the electrons would spend more time around this oxygen. But when we're talking about oxidation states, we don't like this partial charge business. We want to pretend like these covalent bonds are ionic bonds, hypothetical ionic bonds. And if they were hypothetically ionic bonds, what would happen? Well, if you had to give these electrons to somebody, you would give them to the oxygen, the electrons in this period, give them to the oxygen, giving it an oxidation state of negative 1. With the hydrogen having these electrons taken away, it's going to have an oxidation state of positive 1. And the same thing's going to be true for that oxygen and that hydrogen right over there. So this is fascinating, because this is an example where oxygen has an oxidation state not of negative 2, but an oxidation state of negative 1. So this is already kind of interesting. Now it gets even more interesting when we go to oxygen difluoride. Why is this more interesting? Because fluorine is the one thing on this entire table that is more electronegative than oxygen. This is a covalent bond, but in our hypothetical ionic bond, if we had to give these electrons to one of these atoms, you would give it to the fluorine. So the fluorine, each of them would have an oxidation state of negative 1. And the oxygen here-- now, you could imagine, this is nuts for oxygen. The oxidation state for oxygen, it's giving up these electrons. It would be a positive 2. And we talk about oxidation states when we write this little superscript here. We write the sign after the number. And that's just the convention. But it has an oxidation state of positive 2. Oxygen, the thing that likes to oxidize other things, it itself has been oxidized by fluorine. So this is a pretty dramatic example of how something might stray from what's typical oxidation state or it's typical oxidation number. And in general, oxygen will have an oxidation state or oxidation number in most molecules of negative 2. But unless it's bonded with another oxygen or it's bonded to fluorine, which is a much more electronegative-- or actually, not much more, but it's the only atom that is more electronegative than-- or the only element is more electronegative than oxygen.",science_ap-chemistry_redox-reactions-and-electrochemistry-ap
" Let's say that I have five lemons so that's [counting to five] ... five lemons and I were to ask you: what do I have to multiply times five to get one? or in this case: what do I have to multiply times five lemons to get one lemon? and so, another question you might ask because really multiplication and division are two sides of the same coin is what do I have to divide five by to get to one lemon or yellow circle, or whatever I have drawn right over here Well, if you have five things and you divide by five, you're gonna have five groups of one so if you divide by five, you're gonna have [counting to five] ... five groups So you could say five divided by five is equal to one take five things and divide it into five groups then each group is going to have one in them or you could say five times one fifth is equal to one (and I use the dot for multiplication) I could also say five times one fifth is equal to one these are all really saying the same thing Maybe what's kind of interesting here (although it's not some huge learning) it's really just another way of writing what you already probably know, is this idea that if I have a number and I multiply times it's multiplicative inverse (and most of the time when people talk about inverses in mathematics they are talking about the multiplicative inverse) then I'm going to get one so five time one fifth is equal to one but that's just because five times one fifth is the same thing as five divided by five if you were to actually multiply this out you actually take five times one fifth this is equal to five-over-one times one-over-five you multiply the numerators: five times one is five multiply the denominators: one times five is five so you have five fifths, and five fifths is the exact same thing as one So if someone where to ask you a question, they say ""Hey, I have the number 217 and I want to multiply it by something, and I want to get one after multiplying it by that something"" Well then you say - Well look, If I took 217 and divided it by 217 that would get me to one and dividing by 217 is the exact same thing as multiplying by one-over-217 multiplying by its multiplicative inverse which is, once again, a word that is fancier than the actual concept you are just multiplying by the inverse of this number Another way to think about it is if I have five things and I take one fifth of those things, how many things do I have? Well, if I take one fifth of five things I have exactly one thing right over here But the general idea is super-duper-duper simple if I have some crazy number ... 8,345 that's actually not so crazy, let's turn it to something in the millions ... and 271 ... so 8,345,271 And I say, what do I have to multiply by (and now I use this multiplication symbol right now) what do I have to multiply that by in order to get one?

" We've already used a transformation matrix to transform one point, what I want to do in this video, is transform a series of points. So, I have these position vectors, p1, p2, and p3, and I've plotted them right over here. And you can imagine them to even be vertices of a triangle that looks something like this (that's one side, that's another side, and that's another side, right like that) and what I'm curious about is what happens if I transform these three points? And like the last video, I could apply this transformation matrix separately to each of them to see what they transform into, or instead I could take this transformation matrix, and multiply it times a matrix composed of these position vectors, so let me do that... Let me take my transformation matrix, let me copy and paste that. So, copy and paste. So, I'm going to take my transformation matrix and I am going to multiply that by a matrix that has all three of these position vectors in it, where each of the columns of this matrix is going to be one of these position vectors. So, the first one is 2, 1. Then we have -2, 0 Then we have 0, 2. So, one way you could think about it is we're taking our transformation matrix and we're multiplying it by a matrix that is composed of the first column is position vector 1, the second column is position vector 2, and the third column is position vector 3. Now, what is this going to give us? Well, this is a 2x2 matrix. We're multiplying it by a 2x3 matrix, so matrix multiplication is defined over here because the number of columns here is the same as the number of rows here. And it's going to result in a 2x3 matrix. So, it's going to result in a 2x3 matrix. So, 2 rows and 3 columns, which we could imagine represents three new position vectors. So, what's this going to be? Let's go step by step. So, this first entry, first row, first column, is this row times this column, so 2x2 which is 4, plus 1 plus 1, so it's 4 plus 1 so this is going to be 5. Let me do it in a different color. -1 times 2 is -2. plus 2 times 1 plus 2, that's -2 plus 2 which is 0. So, we already see it transformed 2,1 to 5,0. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So if we consider this p1, we consider this p1 prime, p1 after our transformation. Now, let's go to p2. 2 times -2 is -4, plus 1 times 0, so it's -4 plus 0, which is just -4. And then -1 times 2 is positive 2, plus 2 times 0, which is just going to be 0. So it's going to be positive 2 plus 0, which is just 2. So, -4, 2. Negative 1, 2, 3, 4 comma 2. Right over here. So this is p2 This was p2 right over here. This is p2 prime. This is position vector p2 prime. Or the position that position vector p2 prime would specify. And then finally, let's look at p3. So we have 2 times 0, which is 0, plus 1 times 2, so that's zero plus 2 or just 2, and then we have -1 times 0, which is 0. plus 2 times 2 is four. So, we get the point 2, 4. So, 2 comma 1, 2, 3, 4... we go right over here. So, this is p3 right over here. This is p3 prime. And so something interesting has happened. We now have the vertices you could imagine of a new triangle. Of a new triangle that looks something like this. That looks something like this. So, what you can imagine is... Actually, let me draw it... Let me draw our new one with this blue color. so we can see it a little better. So we went from that smaller triangle, we went from that smaller triangle to the larger one, this is the smaller one right over here. That's our smaller triangle to the larger one, or another way you could think of it, this entire triangle was transformed, and right now we only transformed the vertices, but it actually turns out, and I'm not proving this video, that if you transformed- if you took any of these points on this triangle, it would have transformed to a corresponding point on this larger triangle. And what's neat about this is hopefully you're starting to appreciate the power of a transformation matrix. And hopefully you're starting to appreciate why this is useful as you start to think about things like computer games and animation, because what transformation matrixes allow us to do, and this is what these computer programs allow us to do - view things from different perspectives, what they're actually doing under the covers, is they're using transformation matrixes, and they're multiplying them times coordinates, in order to get new coordinates based on the position or the perspective of the player, or the position or the perspective of the camera, or the virtual camera in a computer graphics world. So two, I guess, several neat things here, is we haven't just transformed a point now, we've transformed three points, which could represent the vertices of a triangle, and you see it as this kind of expansion and rotation that seems to have happened when we used this transformation matrix. If we use a different transformation matrix, we would have a different transformation and not only did we do it, but we saw that we could do it with multiple position vectors as the same time. I could have done it independently and gotten the same result, but this is hopefully starting to show you the power of matrixes, and why it also could be useful in things like computer graphics and animation and things like that.",math_precalculus_matrices
" -  So let's get some practice simplifying hairy expressions that have exponents in them. And so we have a hairy expression right over here and I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can rewrite this in a simpler way. All right, let's work through this together and the first thing that jumps out at me is the numerator here. I have the number 125 raised to the 1/8 power times the same number, the same base, 125, raised to the 5/8 power. So I can rewrite this numerator. I can rewrite this numerator using what I know of exponent properties as being equal to 125 to the sum of these two exponents. To the negative 1/8 power plus 5/8 power. All of that is going to be over the existing denominator we have, which is five to the 1/2. All of that is going to be over five to the 1/2 power. So, these are equivalent. Notice, all I did is I added the exponents, these two exponents because I had the same base and we were taking the product of both of these 125 to the negative 1/8 and 125 to the 5/8. And so negative 1/8 plus 5/8, well that is 1/2. So, this is, this right over here is, 1/2. So, this is 125 to the 1/2, over five to the 1/2. Well, that's going to be the same thing. This is going to be equivalent to 125 over five, over five, to the 1/2 power. To the 1/2 power. If I raise 125 to the 1/2 and I'm dividing by five to the 1/2, that's the same thing as doing the division first and then raising that to the 1/2 power. Well, what's 125 divided by five? Well, that's just 25. Now what's 25 to the 1/2? Well, that's the same thing as the principal square root of 25, which is equal to five. And we're all done, that simplified quite nicely. Let's do another one of these. And this one is a little more interesting, 'cause we are starting to involve a variable, we have the variable w, but it's really going to be somewhat the same process. And here the thing that jumps out at me is the denominator. I have the same base, 3w-squared. 3w-squared raised to one power, one exponent, times the same base, 3w-squared, raised to another power. So, this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to our numerator we can just rewrite it 12w to the seventh power over negative 3/2 over our denominator we can write as this base, 3w-squared, and we can add these two exponents. So, we could add negative 2/3 to negative 5/6. Negative 2/3 to negative 5/6. Well, what is that going to be? So, let's see, if I do negative, negative 2/3 is the same thing as negative 4/6, minus 5/6, which is equal to negative 9/6, which is equal to negative 3/2. So, this right over here is the same thing as negative 3/2. Let me just write that. Negative 3/2 power. Negative 2/3 plus negative 5/6 is negative 3/2. Now, what's interesting is I have a negative 3/2 up here and I have a negative 3/2 over here, so, we can do the same thing we did in the last problem. This could simplify to 12w, 12w to the seventh power, over 3w-squared. 3w-squared. All of that, all of that to the, all of that to the negative 3/2 power. Notice what we did here. I had something to the negative 3/2 divided by something else to the negative 3/2. Well, that's the same thing as doing the division first and then raising that quotient to the negative 3/2. And what's nice about this, this is pretty straightforward to simplify. 12 divided by three is four, and w to the seventh divided by w-squared, well, we could divide both by w-squared or you could say this is the same thing as w to the seven-minus-two power. So this is going to be w to the fifth power. W to the fifth power. And so it all simplified to 4w to the fifth power to the negative 3/2. To the negative 3/2. Now, if we want to, this is already pretty simple and at some point it becomes somewhat someone's opinion on which is expression is simpler than another, and it might depend on what you're using the expression for, but one could argue that you could keep trying to simplify this, this is the same thing as, this is the same thing as four to the negative 3/2. To the negative 3/2. Times w to the fifth to the negative 3/2. And once again this is just straight out of our exponent properties. Now, four to the negative 3/2, let's just think about that. Four to the negative 3/2. We're using a different color just as a bit of an aside. So, four to the negative 3/2 is equal to, that's the same thing as one over four to the 3/2, and, let's see. The square root of four is two and then we raise that to the third power, it's gonna be eight. So, this is equal to 1/8. So, that's equal to 1/8, and so all of this is going to be equal to 1/8. And then w to the fifth, and then that to the negative 3/2, we can multiply these exponents. That's going to be w to the five times negative 3/2. Well, it's gonna be the negative 15/2 power. So, I don't know which one you would say is simpler. This one over here or this one over here but they are equivalent and they both are a lot simpler than where we started.",math_algebra-home_alg-exp-and-log
" OK, I know some people aren't into green bean casseroles, but I like them. Plus, they remind me of vector fields. Each green bean is like a little arrow, and I just have the urge to line them all up so they flow in the same direction. Maybe a little wavy, representing the vectors of flow in a river or something. Maybe complete little eddies. Or maybe the beans could represent wind vectors. Long beans would be high-magnitude vectors saying there's a strong wind in that direction, and short, low-magnitude beans would mean low wind speed. You could have a hurricane in your casserole dish with the long beans of high wind speed flowing counterclockwise near the center, mellowing out towards the outer edges of the storm. The center would have the shortest beans of all, showing the calm eye of the storm. Oh, and if you're wondering why I'm not curving the beans like this is because while vector fields might have a shape or flow to them, the vectors themselves don't. They're usually shown as straight lines, or numbers, or both. But that's not because they are straight lines. Vectors just represent what's happening at a single point. It's like this tiny point and this bit of wind can only travel in one direction at a time, so the bean points in that direction. And that tiny bit of wind has a certain speed, which is represented by the length of the bean. But the bean itself is just notation. Vectors themselves don't have a shape, just a direction and a magnitude, which means a bean with a direction and magnitude is just as legitimate a vector as an arrow plotted on a graph, or as a set of two numbers, or as one complex number, or as an orange slice cut with a certain angle and thickness, or as shouting a compass direction at a precise decibel level. North. East. I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of individual vectors sitting by themselves without meaning or context. One string bean does not make a casserole or matherole, as the case may be. But fields of vectors are awesome. They do have curves and patterns, context, and real-world meaning. There are vectorizable fields permeating this casserole dish right now-- the gravitational field, for instance. Gravitational forces are affecting all of my string beans, pulling them down towards the earth. And so you could use the string beans to create a vector-field casserole that actually represents the gravitational field they are currently in. Of course, this means just lining up the beans so all point down. And since they're all affected by basically the same amount of gravity, they should all be the same length. If you are cooking at a high altitude, be sure to cut your string beans shorter by an negligible amount. Another favorite vectorizable field of mine is also currently permeating these string beans-- the electromagnetic field. And if I had a giant bar magnet as a coaster-trivet thing, maybe I'd want my casserole to show the magnetic field that is actually there. The points near the poles of the magnet would have larger vectors, and they'd curve around just like iron filings do when you put them in a magnetic field. And the beans would show how the force weakens as it gets further from the magnet and goes from north to south. Or if you want to be true to life and don't have a magnet, you could put equal-sized string beans all pointing the same way, and then make sure your casserole is always pointing north, which might make it difficult to pass around the table, but I think dish-passing simplicity can be sacrificed for the sake of science, or mathematics, whatever this is. Speaking of which, you can also invent your own vector field by making up a rule for what the vector will be at each point. Like if you just said for any point you choose, you'll take the coordinates x comma y, and give that point a vector that's y comma x, so that this point, 0, 5, has the vector 5, 0. And at negative 3, negative 1, you have negative 1, negative 3. And negative 4, 4 gets 4 and negative 4. It's so simple. But you get this awesome vector field where the vectors kind of whoosh in from the corners and crash and whoosh out. Anyway, there's lots of other stuff you can do, but I'm going to go ahead and pour some goopy stuff into here and get this thing casserole-ing. It may not look very inspiring yet, but it's far from done. The most essential part of a matherole is an awesome oniony topping, and I've got just the trick. I will even show it to you in the next video.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_vi-hart
" -  Before applying to law school in the US, students need to take an exam called the LSAT. Before applying to medical school, students need to take an exam called the MCAT. Here are some summary statistics for each exam. So the LSAT, the mean score is 151 with a standard deviation of 10. And the MCAT, the mean score is 25.1 with a standard deviation of 6.4 Juwan took both exams. He scored 172 on the LSAT and 37 on the MCAT. Which exam did he do relatively better on? So pause this video, and see if you can figure it out. So the way I would think about it is you can't just look at the absolute score because they are on different scales and they have different distributions. But we can use this information. If we assume it's a normal distribution or relatively close to a normal distribution with a meet, centered at this mean, we can think about, well, how many standard deviations from the mean did he score in each of these situations? In both cases, he scored above the mean. But how many standard deviations above the mean? So let's see if we can figure that out. So on the LSAT, let's see, let me write this down, on the LSAT, he scored 172. So how many standard deviations is that going to be? Well, let's take 172, his score, minus the mean, so this is the absolute number that he scored above the mean, and now let's divide that by the standard deviation. So on the LSAT, this is what? This is going to be 21 divided by 10. So this is 2.1 standard deviations, deviations above the mean, above the mean. You could view this as a z-score. It's a z-score of 2.1. We are 2.1 above the mean in this situation. Now, let's think about how he did on the MCAT. On the MCAT, he scored a 37. The mean is a 25.1, and there is a standard deviation of 6.4. So let's see, 37.1 minus 25 would be 12, but now it's gonna be 11.9, 11.9 divided by 6.4. So without even looking at this, so this is going to be approximately, well, this is gonna be a little bit less than two. This is going to be less than two. So based on this information, and we could figure out the exact number here. In fact, let me get my calculator out. So you get the calculator. So if we do 11.9 divided by 6.4, that's gonna get us to one point, I'll just say one point, I'll just say approximately 1.86, so approximately 1.86. So relatively speaking, he did slightly better on the LSAT. He did more standard deviations, although this is close. I would say they're comparable. He did roughly two standard deviations if we were to round to the nearest standard deviation. But if you wanted to get precise, he did a little bit better, relatively speaking, on the LSAT. He did 2.1 standard deviations here while over here he did 1.86 or 1.9 standard deviations. But in everyday language, you would probably say, well, this is comparable. If this was three standard deviations and this is one standard deviation, then you'd be like, oh, he definitely did better on the LSAT.",math_statistics-probability_modeling-distributions-of-data
" In the last video, I showed you that if someone were to walk up to you and ask you what is the arcsine-- Whoops. --arcsine of x? And so this is going to be equal to who knows what. This is just the same thing as saying that the sine of some angle is equal to x. And we solved it in a couple of cases in the last example. So using the same pattern-- Let me show you this. I could have also rewritten this as the inverse sine of x is equal to what. These are equivalent statements. Two ways of writing the inverse sine function. This is more-- This is the inverse sine function. You're not taking this to the negative 1 power. You're just saying the sine of what-- So what question mark-- What angle is equal to x? And we did this in the last video. So by the same pattern, if I were to walk up to you on the street and I were to say the tangent of-- the inverse tangent of x is equal to what? You should immediately in your head say, oh he's just asking me-- He's just saying the tangent of some angle is equal to x. And I just need to figure out what that angle is. So let's do an example. So let's say I were walk up to you on the street. There's a lot of a walking up on a lot of streets. I would write -- And I were to say you what is the arctangent of minus 1? Or I could have equivalently asked you, what is the inverse tangent of minus 1? These are equivalent questions. And what you should do is you should, in your head-- If you don't have this memorized, you should draw the unit circle. Actually let me just do a refresher of what tangent is even asking us. The tangent of theta-- this is just the straight-up, vanilla, non-inverse function tangent --that's equal to the sine of theta over the cosine of theta. And the sine of theta is the y-value on the unit function-- on the unit circle. And the cosine of theta is the x-value. And so if you draw a line-- Let me draw a little unit circle here. So if I have a unit circle like that. And let's say I'm at some angle. Let's say that's my angle theta. And this is my y-- my coordinates x, y. We know already that the y-value, this is the sine of theta. Let me scroll over here. Sine of theta. And we already know that this x-value is the cosine of theta. So what's the tangent going to be? It's going to be this distance divided by this distance. Or from your algebra I, this might ring a bell, because we're starting at the origin from the point 0, 0. This is our change in y over our change in x. Or it's our rise over run. Or you can kind of view the tangent of theta, or it really is, as the slope of this line. The slope. So you could write slope is equal to the tangent of theta. So let's just bear that in mind when we go to our example. If I'm asking you-- and I'll rewrite it here --what is the inverse tangent of minus 1? And I'll keep rewriting it. Or the arctangent of minus 1? I'm saying what angle gives me a slope of minus 1 on the unit circle? So let's draw the unit circle. Let's draw the unit circle like that. Then I have my axes like that. And I want a slope of minus 1. A slope of minus 1 looks like this. If it was like that, it would be slope of plus 1. So what angle is this? So in order to have a slope of minus 1, this distance is the same as this distance. And you might already recognize that this is a right angle. So these angles have to be the same. So this has to be a 45 45 90 triangle. This is an isosceles triangle. These two have to add up to 90 and they have to be the same. So this is 45 45 90. And if you know your 45 45 90-- Actually, you don't even have to know the sides of it. In the previous video, we saw that this is going to be-- Right here. This distance is going to be square root of 2 over 2. So this coordinate in the y-direction is minus square root of 2 over 2. And then this coordinate right here on the x-direction is square root of 2 over 2 because this length right there is that. So the square root of 2 over 2 squared plus the square root of 2 over 2 squared is equal to 1 squared. But the important thing to realize is this is a 45 45 90 triangle. So this angle right here is-- Well if you're just looking at the triangle by itself, you would say that this is a 45 degree angle. But since we're going clockwise below the x-axis, we'll call this a minus 45 degree angle. So the tangent of minus 40-- Let me write that down. So if I'm in degrees. And that tends to be how I think. So I could write the tangent of minus 45 degrees it equals this negative value-- minus square root of 2 over 2 over square root of 2 over 2, which is equal to minus 1. Or I could write the arctangent of minus 1 is equal to minus 45 degrees. Now if we're dealing with radians, we just have to convert this to radians. So we multiply that times-- We get pi radians for every 180 degrees. The degrees cancel out. So you have a 45 over 180. This goes four times. So this is equal to-- you have the minus sign-- minus pi over 4 radians. So the arctangent of minus 1 is equal to minus pi over 4 or the inverse tangent of minus 1 is also equal to minus pi over 4. Now you could say, look. If I'm at minus pi over 4, that's there. That's fine. This gives me a value of minus 1 because the slope of this line is minus 1. But I can keep going around the unit circle. I could add 2 pi to this. Maybe I could add 2 pi to this and that would also give me-- If I took the tangent of that angle, it would also give me minus 1. Or I could add 2 pi again and it'll, again, give me minus 1. In fact I could go to this point right here. And the tangent would also give me minus 1 because the slope is right there. And like I said in the sine-- in the inverse sine video, you can't have a function that has a 1 to many mapping. You can't-- Tangent inverse of x can't map to a bunch of different values. It can't map to minus pi over 4. It can't map to 3-- what it would be? --3 pi over 4. I don't know. It would be-- I'll just say 2 pi minus pi over 4. Or 4 pi minus pi. It can't map to all of these different things. So I have to constrict the range on the inverse tan function. And we'll restrict it very similarly to the way we restricted the sine-- the inverse sine range. We're going to restrict it to the first and fourth quadrants. So the answer to your inverse tangent is always going to be something in these quadrants. But it can't be this point and that point. Because a tangent function becomes undefined at pi over 2 and at minus pi ever 2. Because your slope goes vertical. You start dividing-- Your change in x is 0. You're dividing-- Your cosine of theta goes to 0. So if you divide by that, it's undefined. So your range-- So if I-- Let me write this down. So if I have an inverse tangent of x, I'm going to-- Well, what are all the values that the tangent can take on? So if I have the tangent of theta is equal to x, what are all the different values that x could take on? These are all the possible values for the slope. And that slope can take on anything. So x could be anywhere between minus infinity and positive infinity. x could pretty much take on any value. But what about theta? Well I just said it. Theta, you can only go from minus pi over 2 all the way to pi over 2. And you can't even include pi over 2 or minus pi over 2 because then you'd be vertical. So then you say your-- So if I'm just dealing with vanilla tangent. Not the inverse. The domain-- Well the domain of tangent can go multiple times around, so let me not make that statement. But if I want to do inverse tangent so I don't have a 1 to many mapping. I want to cross out all of these. I'm going to restrict theta, or my range, to be greater than the minus pi over 2 and less than positive pi over 2. And so if I restrict my range to this right here and I exclude that point and that point. Then I can only get one answer. When I say tangent of what gives me a slope of minus 1? And that's the question I'm asking right there. There's only one answer. Because if I keep-- This one falls out of it. And obviously as I go around and around, those fall out of that valid range for theta that I was giving you. And then just to kind of make sure we did it right. Our answer was pi over 4. Let's see if we get that when we use our calculator. So the inverse tangent of minus 1 is equal to that. Let's see if that's the same thing as minus pi over 4. Minus pi over 4 is equal to that. So it is minus pi over 4. But it was good that we solved it without a calculator because 1it's hard to recognize this as minus pi over 4.",math_engageny-precalc_precalc-4
"  You probably notice that whenever you have a cold your nose gets all stuffy and when your nose gets all stuffy with a bunch of stuff you're not able to taste things very well. So let's imagine that you're trying to eat a strawberry. So you're eating the strawberry. Normally it tastes really good and it goes in your mouth and as you're chewing the strawberry you're breaking down different cellular components and these cellular components release little molecules and these little molecules will travel through the back of your throat and some of them will actually come into your nose. And as you're chewing the strawberry you're actually smelling little molecules that are being released. You're actually using your sense of smell in conjunction with your sense of taste with your ability to taste the strawberry. And so if you knock out your sense of smell which is what happens when you have a cold. If your sense of smell is knocked out you're relying only on your sense of taste. And when you only rely on your sense of taste you're not able to taste things as well. Things don't taste as rich. So you can actually try this. Next time you're eating something just go ahead and close your nose and see if whatever it is you're eating tastes differently after you're no longer smelling anything. So hopefully this goes to show a little bit about why our sense of smell is important. Now we can definitely live without our sense of smell, but it does greatly enrich our everyday lives. Smell is also known as olfaction. Sometimes our sense of smell can be called our olfactory sense and we'll talk a little bit about how this word comes into play and a little bit of the anatomy later on. Let's go ahead and go into the anatomy of our olfactory system really quickly. If I again draw a profile of someone. Here's the nose, here's the mouth, and here's the chin. There is a nostril and this nostril basically is an opening to allow air and various odor molecules to come into the nose. There is actually a region that you can't see. This region is known as your olfactory epithelium. This region is the olfactory epithelium. Olfactory epithelium. So again, olfactory olfaction. Separating this olfactory epithelium from the brain because the brain actually sits up here. So we've got a little bit of the brain and it sits up here. So separating the brain from the olfactory epithelium in this nasal passage over here is a piece of bone known as the cribriform plate. So this little piece of bone is known as the cribriform plate. And sitting right above the cribriform plate is actually a little extension from the brain. So there's actually an extension that comes from the brain and it sits right above the cribriform plate. I'm drawing it here in purple and it looks like a little bulb and this is actually known as the olfactory bulb. So olfactory bulb. So again, olfaction, olfactory bulb, and the olfactory bulb is basically a bundle of nerves so it's actually one of the cranial nerves that exits the brain and so this bundle of nerves sends little projections through the cribriform plate into the olfactory epithelium. So this projection of nerves breaks off and branches off and there are thousands and thousands of cells sending little connections into the olfactory epithelium. So I'm only drawing a few of them over here, but there are thousands of these cells sending little connections into the olfactory epithelium and at the very end of each one of these little cells are receptors and each receptor is sensitive to one particular molecule. It's actually sensitive to one particular type of molecule. So for example let's imagine that we have a benzene ring and most things that have benzene rings are known as aromatic compounds and normally you can actually smell aromatic compounds. So a molecule has a benzene ring it usually has some sort of scent and that scent is picked up via the olfactory bulb and these little extensions that come into the olfactory epithelium. So we have a little benzene ring, A little odor molecule and it travels into the nose. It will actually bind to a small receptor on one of these nerve endings. So what I'm going to do next is zoom in into this region over here. I just want to look at the olfactory bulb and in particular I want to be able to look at each one of these little olfactory sensory neurons and their little projections that bind to various molecules in the environment. So what I'm going to do now is zoom into that little part that I highlighted earlier. And so we're just going to look at the olfactory bulb so let me just label this olfactory bulb. And as I mentioned before the olfactory bulb was separated from the nasal passage by something known as a cribriform plate. The cribriform plate is basically just bone and there are a bunch of little holes in the cribriform plate that basically allow the cells, these olfactory sensory cells to send projections to the olfactory bulb. So let's imagine that there's an olfactory sensory cell and it sends a little projection into the olfactory bulb. And so it sends a little projection and this cell is situated inside the olfactory epithelium and there are all kinds of other epithelial cells over here so I could just kind of draw those in. So there are all kinds of epithelial cells that basically secrete mucus and all kinds of things and these olfactory epithelial cells are situated in between the rest of the epithelial cells. And there are thousands of different types of epithelial cells and each type has a particular receptor. So let's say that this particular olfactory sensory cell is responsible, has a little receptor and this little receptor is sensitive to benzene rings. So as we have a benzene molecule enter the nose through the nostrils it enters the nasal passage and eventually will bounce into this receptor and when it binds to this receptor it will actually trigger a cascade of events that causes this cell to fire. This cell will fire an action potential and the action potential will actually end up here in the olfactory bulb and what we have is we actually have a whole bunch of olfactory sensory cells that are sensitive to the same molecule. So we have another one over here and it will actually synapse to the same place. So we got another olfactory sensory cell and this also is sensitive to this benzene molecule. So the benzene molecule comes in and activates a whole bunch of cells that have benzene receptors and all the cells that are sensitive to benzene will all fire an action potential to one particular location in the olfactory bulb and this particular location is known as a glomerulus. So glomerulus. And the glomerulus is basically we can think of it as a designation point for various sensory olfactory cells that are sensitive to the same molecule. So we could think of this glomerulus as a benzene glomerulus because all the cells that are sensitive to benzene will synapse over here. And what actually happens is they will synapse onto another cell type. So there is another cell and this is known as a mitral, so mitral or as a tufted cell. Tufted cell and this mitral/tufted cell will actually project to the brain. So the reason we have this type of organization is because it's a lot easier for one cell to send a projection to the brain then it would be for thousands of these cells to send a projection to the brain. So just to kind of go into this in a little bit more detail so what we can also have are other cell types. Let's imagine that there's this blue cell over here. And let's imagine that this blue cell is sensitive to 2 benzene rings that are connected to one another. So if we have 2 benzene rings that are connected to one another they will bind onto a receptor on this blue olfactory sensory cell and this blue cell will go through the cribriform plate and synapse in the olfactory bulb, but it will synapse at a different location as will other blue cells sensitive to double benzene rings and they will synapse onto a double benzene glomerulus and so on and so this double benzene glomerulus has a different mitral/tufted cell that will send a projection to the brain. So this is the general organization of various cells in the olfactory epithelium and the general idea here is that we have hundreds of various cells that are hypersensitive to one particular molecule and these hundreds of cells will all send all their projections to one glomerulus and that one glomerulus will have several 1mitral/tufted cells that will then go to the brain. 1So now what I want to go into is 1I just want to look at this part right here. 1So I want to look at how a molecule will bind 1to a receptor and how it triggers an action potential. 1So let's imagine that we have 1this molecule of benzene over here. 1So it will enter the nasal passage 1and it will bounce around until it binds 1to a particular receptor. 1So what we have is a particular receptor 1that is in the membrane of an olfactory sensory cell. 1So this benzene molecule will come in 1and it will bind right here. 1It will bind and when it binds it will actually cause 1this receptor which is known as 1a G protein-coupled receptor 1and it's called a G protein-coupled receptor 1because there's actually a protein inside 1that is known as a G protein which it is coupled to. 1It's coupled, sorry ie. The G-protein is coupled to the 1receptor and when the molecule of benzene binds 1it will actually cause disassociation here. 1The G protein will break away 1and it will cause a cascade of events inside the cell. 1So this inside one of the sensory olfactory cells 1that we were talking about earlier. 1And so one of the effects that this G protein will have 1is it will actually bind to an ion channel. 1So it will bind to an ion channel 1and the ion channel will basically allow 1positive ions from outside the cell to flow inside 1and this will cause the cell to depolarize 1and fire an action potential that eventually 1will go through the cribriform plate 1and then synapse to a mitral/tufted cell 1and that mitral/tufted cell will send 1a synapse to the brain. 1So let's just go over everything that we talked about 1really quickly. 1We have an odor molecule which is a benzene ring, 1in this example, will bind to a GPCR. 1So this GPCR is a particular odor receptor 1and the G protein. 1So the G protein-coupled receptor, 1the G protein will actually break away. 1The G protein breaks away 1and activates various things inside the cell 1and one of those things is 1an ion channel gets activated. 1That causes the cell to depolarize 1and fire an action potential 1and the action potential will go through 1the cribriform plate and into the glomerulus 1and it will activate a mitral/tufted cell 1which will then enter the brain 1and then your brain is able to perceive that odor 1through this pathway over here.",science_health-and-medicine_nervous-system-and-sensory-infor
" -  Let's solve some more of these systems problems. If you remember, there's a hard way to do this, and an easy way to do this. The hard way is to solve Newton's second law for each box individually, and then combine them, and you get two equations with two unknowns, you try your best to solve the algebra without losing any sins, but let's be honest, it usually goes wrong. So, the easy way to do this, the way to get the magnitude of the acceleration of the objects in your system, that is to say, if I wanna know the magnitude at which this five kilogram box accelerates, or that this three kilogram box accelerates, all I need to do is take the net external force that tries to make my system go, and then I divide by my total mass of my system. This is a quick way to get what the magnitude of the acceleration is of the objects in my system, but it's good to note, it'll only work if the objects in your system are required to move with the same magnitude of acceleration. And in this case they are, what I have here is a five kilogram mass tied to a rope, and that rope passes over a pulley, pulls over and connects to this three kilogram mass so that if this five kilogram mass has some acceleration downward, this three kilogram mass has to be accelerating upward at the same rate, otherwise this rope would break or snap or stretch, and we're assuming that that doesn't happen. So this rope is the condition that requires the fact that this rope doesn't break is what allows us to say that the system is just a single, big total mass with external forces exerted on it. So how would we solve this? I'd just say that, well, what are the external forces? Keep in mind, external forces are forces that are exerted on the objects in our system from objects outside of our system. So one external force would just be the force of gravity on this five kilogram mass. So I'm gonna have a force of gravity this way, and that force of gravity is just going to be equal to five kilograms times 9.8 meters per second squared, because that's how we find the force of gravity. Should I make it positive or negative? Well, this five kilogram is gonna be the one that's pulling downward, so if the question is, I hold these masses and I let go, what's the acceleration? This five kilogram mass is gonna accelerate downward, it's gonna drive the system forward. That's the force making the system go, so I'm gonna make that a positive force. And then I figure out, are there any other forces making this system go? No, there are not. You might say, well what about this tension over here? Isn't the tension on this three kilogram mass? Isn't that tension making this system go? Not really, because that's an internal force exerted between the objects in our system and internal forces are always opposed by another internal force. This tension will be pulling the three kilogram, trying to make it move, but it opposes the motion of the five kilogram mass, and if we think of this three plus five kilogram mass as a single object, these end up just canceling on our single object that we're viewing as one big eight kilogram mass. So those are internal forces. We don't include them, they're not part of this trick. We have to figure out what other forces would try to make this system go or try to prevent it from moving. Another force that tries to prevent it from moving is the force of gravity on the three kilogram mass. Or, one force that tries to prevent the system from moving would be this force of gravity. How big is that? That's three kilograms times 9.8 meters per second squared. And that's trying to prevent the system from moving. This five kilogram mass is accelerating downward, and this force is in the opposite direction of motion. That trips people out sometimes. They're like, I don't understand, they're both pointing down. Shouldn't they have the same sign? They would when we're using Newton's second law the way we usually use it, but when we're using this trick, what we're concerned with are forces in the direction of motion, this is an easy way to figure it out, forces in the direction of motion we're gonna call positive. And any forces opposite the direction of motion we're gonna call negative. So, forces that propel the system forward we'll just call that positive direction. Forces that resist the motion, we're just gonna call that the negative direction. And since this is on this side of the motion of the system, this system is, everything in this system is going this way. The three kilogram mass goes up. The string over here goes up. The string up here goes to the right. The string right here goes down. The five kilogram mass goes down. Because all the motion in the system is this way, we'd find that way's positive, but this force of gravity on the three kilogram mass is the opposite direction. It's opposing the motion of the system. It's preventing the system from accelerating as fast as it would have. That's why we subtract it. And now we just divide by the total mass. And the total mass is just five plus three, is gonna be eight kilograms, and I get the acceleration of my system. So if I just add this up, I get 2.45 meters per second squared. So this is a really fast way to get what the acceleration of our system is, but you have to be careful. If the question is, what's the acceleration of a five kilogram box? Well, technically, that acceleration of the five kilogram box would be negative 2.45. What we really found here, since we were just finding the magnitude, was the size of the acceleration, since this five kilogram box is accelerating down, and we usually treat down as negative. You won't wanna forget that negative in putting in that answer the acceleration of the three kilogram box, however, would be positive 2.45 meters per second squared. So when you're applying this to an individual box, you have to be very careful and make sure that you apply that acceleration with the correct sign for that particular box. And if you wanted to find the tension now, now it's easy to find the tension. I could find this tension right here if I wanted to. If the next step was find the tension in the string connected to the boxes, now I can just use Newton's second law, but the way we always use it. I'm done with the trick. The trick is just the way to get the magnitude of the acceleration. Now that I have that, I'm done treating it as a system or a single object. I'll look at this single five kilogram mass all alone, and I'll say that the acceleration of the five kilogram mass, which is Newton's second law, is gonna equal the net force on the five kilogram mass divided by the mass of the five kilogram mass. I know the acceleration of the five kilogram mass, but if I'm gonna treat up as positive now, I gotta plug this acceleration in with a negative sign. So negative 2.45 meters per second squared is gonna equal the net force on the five kilogram mass. I've got tension up, you might be like, wait, we said that was an internal force. It was an internal force, and we didn't include it up here, but we're doing the old rules now. Normal second law in the vertical direction. So I use vertical forces, and if they're upward I'm gonna treat them as positive, and if they're downward like this five times 9.8, I'm gonna treat it as a negative, because it points down. Five times 9.8 meters per second squared, and I divide by the five kilogram mass, 'cause that's the box I'm analyzing. I'm not analyzing the whole system. I'm just analyzing the five kilogram box now. And I can solve and I can get my tension. The alternate way to do this would be to say, all right, let's just treat down as positive for this five kilogram mass. I'd then plug my acceleration in as positive, and I'd plug my force of gravity in positive, then my tension would be negative. I'd get the same value. Here I'm just solving for the magnitude of the tension anyway. So if I solve this, if I plug this into the calculator and solve for tension, I'm gonna get 36.75 Newtons, which is less than the force of gravity, which it has to be, 'cause if the tension was greater than the force of gravity, this five kilogram mass would accelerate up. We know that doesn't happen. The tension's gotta be less than the force of gravity, so that this five kilogram mass can accelerate downward. So that's a quick way to solve for the magnitude of the acceleration of the system by treating it as a single object. We're saying that if it's a single object, or thought of as a single object, which we can do, 'cause these are required to have the same acceleration, or same magnitude of the acceleration, that if we're treating it like a single object, only external forces matter, and those external forces that make the system go are going to accelerate the system. And those external forces that resist the motion are trying to reduce the acceleration, and we divide by the total mass of the system that we're treating as one object, we get the acceleration. If that still seems like mathematical witchcraft, or if you're not sure about this whole idea, I encourage you to go back and watch the video. We solved one of these types of problems the hard way. And you see, you really do end up with the force that tries to make the system go externally, and the external force that tries to stop it divided by the total mass gives you the acceleration. Essentially, what we're saying is that these internal forces cancel if you're thinking of this system as one single object, 'cause these are applied internally, and they're opposed to each other. One tries to make the system go, one tries to make the system stop.",science_physics_forces-newtons-laws
" Let's imagine that I'm here. And this is me at the age-- actually, I'll do this right now-- so let's say at the age of 31. And then I go into the future. So this is a line for the present. And then I go into the future. And this is me again. And this is now at the age of 71. So I've got 40 extra years. I've even picked up a cane to help me walk around. And finally, I go even further in the future, and I'm being very optimistic. And I'm going to go ahead and say this is at the age of 101. I live to be a centennial. And I'm sitting in a wheelchair, and I'm going to wave out at you. So that's me in a wheelchair at the age of 101. And we're going to apply that formula we've been talking about so much, delta P equals Q times R. So I said Q is cardiac output. And we've got R is resistance. So we've got this formula. And let's say I go to the doctor's office. And I go today, and I go in 40 years, and I go again when I'm 101. And today, they tell me my blood pressure is 120 over 80. And actually, I went not too long ago, and that's pretty much what they told me it was. And I go in the future, and in 40 years, they tell me it's actually gone up. My blood pressure is now 150 over 90. And in fact, I go again, when I'm 101, and they say it's 180 over, let's say, 105. So the blood pressure is rising, and that's basically what I'm told. And they say, well, you've got to make sure you eat well and exercise, and that should help your blood pressure. And I'm left wondering what the connection is between the two. So let's figure out what that connection is exactly. So my blood pressure, I just said, is 120 over 80. And if I want to figure out my mean arterial pressure, meaning the average pressure in my arteries, I can actually use my blood pressure to give me a good guess as to what it's going to be. So I know that I spend about 1/3-- my mean arterial pressure is going to equal 1/3 times my systolic, because I know I spend about 1/3 of the time-- my heart does anyway-- spends 1/3 of its time beating. And it spends 2/3 of its time relaxing. And the relaxing pressure is the diastolic pressure, that's 80. And so that works out to about 95. And so that's how I came up with that 95 number. And that's also why it's not exactly 100, which is what you'd think an average would be between two numbers. But it's because we don't spend the exact same amount of time in systole as diastole. So then if I wanted to figure out here, it would be 1/3 times 150 plus 2/3 times 90. And that works out to 110. And if I wanted to do it at the age of 101, my mean arterial pressure would be 1/3 times 180 plus 2/3 times 105. And that works out to 130. So I figured out my mean arterial pressure. Let me write that with a line. I also need my mean venous pressure, because we know we're going to have to subtract the two from one another to get the delta P, delta meaning the difference. So mean venous pressure right now is about 5. And let's assume-- this is one of a few assumptions we're going to make-- let's assume that it doesn't change, that over a few years, it really stays around the same. It's about 5. Well, then if I know that, my delta P is easy to figure out, right. I can just take 95 minus 5, and that'll get me 90. And I can take 110 minus 5, and that's 105. And I can take 130 minus 5, and that's 125. So I figured out my delta P, which is basically my mean arterial pressure minus my mean venous pressure, and that equals my delta P. OK, so far so good. Now let me change colors to figure out my Q, my flow. And right now, I have, let's say, a stroke volume-- I'll write it up here-- stroke volume, meaning each time my heart beats, about 70 milliliters of blood go out. So each time my heart beats, it sends out to the rest of the body 70 ml of blood. And that's based on the fact that I'm about 70 kilos. And my heart rate is about 70, very relaxed heart rate. And let's assume, just as we did with the mean venous pressure, that that doesn't change. So this is not going to change over time. So this works out to about 5 liters a minute because Q is simply-- let me write that here-- Q is simply SV times HR. And so I'm just multiplying those two numbers together, and you get about 5 liters a minute, and it doesn't change over time. So 5 liters a minute here, 5 liters a minute here. And I should probably mention all of my pressure units should be millimeters of mercury. I didn't write that, just to not clutter up the board. But let's just assume that-- well, it's not assuming. It is millimeters of mercury. So now using my equation, I can now say, well, delta P-- and actually maybe up here I should even change this. It should be blue so that I'm consistent. So delta P equals Q times R. So if delta P is 90 and Q is 5, my resistance equals 18. Right? It's just a bit of math that I did very quickly. But 18 times 5 is 90. And here I could figure it out. 105 divided by 5 would give me a resistance of 21. And here, I would figure out that it's going to be 25. So one thing that I've been told by my doctor is my blood pressure is rising. And two things that I've assumed are that my mean venous pressure is the same, and that my cardiac output is the same. And if I assume that, and that's definitely not true for everybody, but if I assume that for me, then that means that my resistance has gone up. Over time, my resistance has gone up. And let's now change screens and figure out how that could possibly happen. So let me draw myself out again. So I've got three versions of me. I've got the present me at the age of 31. I've got the future me with a cane at the age of 71. And I've got the really old version of myself living at a ripe, old age of 101, waving, in fact. So three versions of myself. And if I was to draw my arterial tree, let's say, a simplified version of my arterial tree. Let's say here's a vessel coming through, and I've got, let's say, another vessel, and this branches here. And I've got a third vessel, and this branches here. Right now my arterial tree looks pretty good, pretty clean. And that's why my resistance was 18. Blood is flowing through very smoothly. It's going out this way to feed the kidney and maybe to my ears and my eyes and my foot. And it's basically making its way through, no trouble. Now at the age of 71, something happens. Actually, let me just draw a little divider line. At the age of 71, something happens. I have, let's say, the same arterial tree. I'll try to draw it the same way. Except now, I've been eating, for 40 years, foods that are not the best. And I certainly haven't exercised a whole heck of a lot. I haven't gone to the gym very often. And now I've got buildup of plaque. So let's say I've got a plaque right there. And I've got a plaque, let's say, another one right there. And let's say I have a plaque right there. So I've got three little plaques. And we'll get into plaque and what it's made of exactly in a future video. But for the moment, just think of it as something that's blocking up that vessel. And it's usually made of fatty substances and macrophages and cells that have died and all sorts of basically crud that fills up the vessels. And so, because it's filled up the vessels, now here, my radius got smaller. My vessel radius in here got smaller. And over here, it got smaller. So blood, as it's flowing through, is having a tougher time getting through because the radius is smaller in these spots. And, as you know, if you calculate total resistance-- and that's what, actually, this is, total resistance-- the total resistance will start to slowly climb up. And in this case, maybe it climbs up to 21. And now years go by, let's say 30 more years go by. I'm now in a wheelchair. And I continue to not eat so well. I eat the same sort of fast food that isn't healthy for me, but I can't possibly stop because I find it tasty. And at the end of the day, my vessels look like this. I have that same one as before, let's say. And let's say this one actually grew longer. So instead of just being part of the vessel, let's say it's huge now. This one got very big. And let's say this one up here actually continued and grew a little bit as well. But I also picked up another one right here, let's say. And I also got one right here. So I have a few more blocks in the road. And so now my blood is having a real hard time 1getting through because it's got more obstruction to flow. 1All my paths have a smaller radius. 1And we know, and I've mentioned a number of times 1now, about the relationship between a radius 1and resistance. 1And that as the radius everywhere gets smaller, 1the resistance is going to get bigger. 1And so my total resistance here, let's say, is about 25. 1So now you can see how eating a certain way and not exercising 1is going to lead to potentially developing these plaques that 1act as roadblocks and get in the way of blood flow. 1And the reason that that's a problem is that, as we see now, 1the radius gets smaller, the resistance goes up. 1And in the previous slide here, we actually 1can see now that as the resistance goes up, 1assuming that the other things kind of stay the same, 1your blood pressure can go up. 1And so when you hear, in the doctor's office, 1that you have a blood pressure of a certain number 1over a certain number, that's one thing that we can measure. 1And what it tells you is a little bit 1of information about some of the things that we can't easily 1measure, such as resistance. 1So let's stop there, and we'll pick up.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system
" Your car gets 25 miles per gallon, and you want to go on a 400-mile road trip. Right now, gas costs $3 per gallon. How much will the gas for your road trip cost? So let's see. They tell us they're going on a 400-mile road trip. 400 miles. So the first thing that I'd want to think about is, well, how many gallons am I using? And then once I know how many gallons I'm using, I know it's $3 per gallon, so I can multiply the number of gallons by $3. So to figure out the number of gallons, would I want to multiply 400 miles-- would I want to multiply that times the miles per gallon, which is 25, or would I want to multiply by the gallons per mile? Well, if I multiply by the gallons per mile, and I multiply that times 400, then I would get the number of gallons. So let's just think about that. I want to multiply that times-- and I'll write the units first-- the gallons per mile. And what are the gallons per mile? Well, we have 25 miles per gallon. We have 25 miles for every 1 gallon. Or you could say we have 1 gallon for every 25 miles. So I really just took the reciprocal of 25 miles per gallon and made it 1/25 gallons per mile. Now what do we get when we multiply these two things? The whole purpose was to figure out how many gallons we're going to use. Well, we see that our miles cancel out. Miles cancel out with miles. And then I have 400 times 1/25 gallons, which is the same thing as 400 divided by 25 gallons. So this is equal to 400/25 gallons, which is the same thing as 400 divided by 25 is equal to 16 gallons. Now it's always important to do a reality check here, not just to try to blindly cancel out units. Does this actually makes sense that 16 is a much lower number than 400? Well, sure it does. And actually, if you have any experience filling up a car, you would sense that, OK, well, that's about the size. On around 16 gallons, a car tends to go 300 or 400 miles if it gets pretty good fuel mileage. So that just makes sense from experience. And it also make sense based on how it's stated. You get 25 miles per gallon. So you're going to need fewer gallons than you're going to need miles. So this all seems to make sense so far. But we haven't answered their question. They want to know, how much will my trip cost? Right now, we've just figured out how much fuel we're going to use. So then we could take our 16 gallons. And to figure out the dollar cost, are we going to multiply it by dollars per gallon or gallons per dollar? Well, if we're thinking just about unit conversion, we want to multiply times the dollars per gallon. So I could write it like this. I could write it like dollars per gallon. Actually, let me just write out the word ""dollar."" Dollars per gallon. The units will cancel out. And it also makes sense. Whatever number of dollars per gallon, I multiply it times the number of gallons, and that's going to tell me how much it's going to cost. This happens at the fuel pump every day. Hey, it's $3 per gallon. I'm going to fill up 16 gallons. Hey, 3 times 16. So let's do that. So it's $3 per gallon. We see the gallons cancel out. And we are left with 16 times $3, which is the same thing as $48. And we are done.",math_algebra_working-units
" One of you all sent a fairly interesting problem, so I thought I would work it out. The problem is I have a group of 30 people, so 30 people in a room. They're randomly selected 30 people. And the question is what is the probability that at least 2 people have the same birthday? This is kind of a fun question because that's the size of a lot of classrooms. What's the probability that at least someone in the classroom shares a birthday with someone else in the classroom? That's a good way to phrase as well. This is the same thing as saying, what is the probability that someone shares with at least someone else. They could share it with 2 other people or 4 other people in the birthday. And at first this problem seems really hard because there's a lot of circumstances that makes this true. I could have exactly 2 people have the same birthday. I could have exactly 3 people have the same birthday. I could have exactly 29 people have the same birthday and all of these make this true, so do I add the probability of each of those circumstances? And then add them up and then that becomes really hard. And then I would have to say, OK, whose birthdays and I comparing? And I would have to do combinations. It becomes a really difficult problem unless you make kind of one very simplifying take on the problem. This is the opposite of-- well let me draw the probability space. Let's say that this is all of the outcomes. Let me draw it with a thicker line. So let's say that's all of the outcomes of my probability space. So that's 100% of the outcomes. We want to know-- let me draw it in a color that won't be offensive to you. That doesn't look that great, but anyway. Let's say that this is the probability, this area right here-- and I don't know how big it really is, we'll figure it out. Let's say that this is the probability that someone shares a birthday with at least someone else. What's this area over here? What's this green area? Well, that means if these are all the cases where someone shares a birthday with someone else, these are all the area where no one shares a birthday with anyone. Or you could say, all 30 people have different birthdays. This is what we're trying to figure out. I'll just call it the probability that someone shares. I'll call it the probability of sharing, probability of s. If this whole area is area 1 or area 100%, this green area right here, this is going to be 1 minus p of s. This is going to be 1 minus p of s. Or if we said that this is the probability-- or another way we could say it, actually this is the best way to think about it. If this is different, so this is the probability of different birthdays. This is the probability that all 30 people have 30 different birthdays. No one shares with anyone. The probability that someone shares with someone else plus the probability that no one shares with anyone-- they all have distinct birthdays-- that's got to be equal to 1. Because we're either going to be in this situation or we're going to be in that situation. Or you can say they're equal to 100%. Either way, 100% and 1 are the same number. It's equal to 100%. So if we figure out the probability that everyone has the same birthday we could subtract it from 100. So let's see. We could we just rewrite this. The probability that someone shares a birthday with someone else, that's equal to 100% minus the probability that everyone has distinct, separate birthdays. And the reason why I'm doing that is because as I started off in the video, this is kind of hard to figure out. You know, I can figure out the probability that 2 people have the same birthday, 5 people, and it becomes very confusing. But here, if I wanted to just figure out the probability that everyone has a distinct birthday, it's actually a much easier probability to solve for. So what's the probability that everyone has a distinct birthday? So let's think about it. Person one. Just for simplicity, let's imagine the case that we only have 2 people in the room. What's the probably that they have different birthdays? Let's see, person one, their birthday could be 365 days out of 365 days of the year. You know, whenever their birthday is. And then person two, if we wanted to ensure that they don't have the same birthday, how many days could person two be born on? Well, it could be born on any day that person one was not born on. So there are 364 possibilities out 365. So if you had 2 people, the probability that no one is born on the same birthday-- this is just 1. It's just going to be equal to 364/365. Now what happens if we had 3 people? So first of all the first person could be born on any day. Then the second person could be born on 364 possible days out of 365. And then the third person, what's the probability that the third person isn't born on either of these people birthdays? So 2 days are taken up, so the probability is 363/365. You multiply them out. You get 365 times 36-- actually I should rewrite this one. Instead of saying this is 1, let me write this as-- the numerator is 365 times 364 over 365 squared. Because I want you to see the pattern. Here the probability is 365 times 364 times 363 over 365 to the third power. And so, in general, if you just kept doing this to 30, if I just kept this process for 30 people-- the probability that no one shares the same birthday would be equal to 365 times 364 times 363-- I'll have 30 terms up here. All the way down to what? All the way down to 336. That'll actually be 30 terms divided by 365 to the 30th power. And you can just type this into your calculator right now. It'll take you a little time to type in 30 numbers, and you'll get the probability that no one shares the same birthday with anyone else. But before we do that let me just show you something that might make it a little bit easier. Is there any way that I can mathematically express this with factorials? Or that I could mathematically express this with factorials? Let's think about it. 365 factorial is what? 365 factorial is equal to 365 times 364 times 363 times-- all the way down to 1. You just keep multiplying. It's a huge number. Now, if I just want the 365 times the 364 in this case, I have to get rid of all of these numbers back here. One thing I could do is I could divide this thing by all of these numbers. So 363 times 362-- all the way down to 1. So that's the same thing as dividing by 363 factorial. 365 factorial divided by 363 factorial is essentially this because all of these terms cancel out. So this is equal to 365 factorial over 363 factorial over 365 squared. And of course, for this case, it's almost silly to worry about the factorials, but it becomes useful once we have something larger than two terms up here. So by the same logic, this right here is going to be equal to 365 factorial over 362 factorial over 365 squared. And actually, just another interesting point. How did we get this 365? Sorry, how did we get this 363 factorial? Well, 365 minus 2 is 363, right? And that makes sense because we only wanted two terms up here. We only wanted two terms right here. So we wanted to divide by a factorial that's two less. And so we'd only get the highest two terms left. This is also equal to-- you could write this as 365 factorial divided by 365 minus 2 factorial 365 minus 2 is 363 factorial and then you just end up with those two terms and that's that there. And then likewise, this right here, this numerator you could rewrite as 365 factorial divided by 365 minus 3-- and we had 3 people-- factorial. And that should hopefully make sense, right? This is the same thing as 365 factorial-- well 365 divided 1by 3 is 362 factorial. 1And so that's equal to 365 times 364 times 1363 all the way down. 1Divided by 362 times all the way down. 1And that'll cancel out with everything else and you'd 1be just left with that. 1And that's that right there. 1So by that same logic, this top part here can be written as 1365 factorial over what? 1365 minus 30 factorial. 1And I did all of that just so I could show you kind of the 1pattern and because this is frankly easier to type into a 1calculator if you know where the factorial button is. 1So let's figure out what this entire probability is. 1So turning on the calculator, we want-- so let's 1do the numerator. 1365 factorial divided by-- well, what's 365 minus 30? 1That's 335. 1Divided by 335 factorial and that's the whole numerator. 1And now we want to divide the numerator by 365 1to the 30th power. 1Let the calculator think and we get 0.2936. 1Equals 0.2936. 1Actually 37 if you rounded, which is equal to 29.37%. 1Now, just so you remember what we were doing all along, this 1was the probability that no one shares a birthday with anyone. 1This was the probability of everyone having distinct, 1different birthdays from everyone else. 1And we said, well, the probability that someone shares 1a birthday with someone else, or maybe more than one person, 1is equal to all of the possibilities-- kind of the 1100%, the probability space, minus the probability that no 1one shares a birthday with anybody. 1So that's equal to 100% minus 29.37%. 1Or another way you could write it as that's 1 minus 0.2937, 1which is equal to-- so if I want to subtract that from 1. 11 minus-- that just means the answer. 1That means 1 minus 0.29. 1You get 0.7063. 1So the probability that someone shares a birthday with someone 1else is 0.7063-- it keeps going. 1Which is approximately equal to 70.6%. 1Which is kind of a neat result because if you have 30 people 1in a room you might say, oh wow, what are the odds 1that someone has the same birthday as someone else? 1It's actually pretty high. 170% of the time, if you have a group of 30 people, at least 1 1person shares a birthday with at least one other 1person in the room. 1So that's kind of a neat problem. 1And kind of a neat result at the same time. 1Anyway, see you in the next video.",math_precalculus_prob-comb
" We have a graph right over here, and we have 4 potential function definitions for that graph. What you might want to do is pause the video right now and think about which of these function definitions are actually being depicted in this graph right over here? I'm assuming you've given a go at it. Now let's work through it together. Before we even address these, we all see that they all have a log base 2 in the function definition. Let's just remind ourselves what y equals log base 2 of x even looks like, and then we could think about what happens if we were to add 1 or subtract 1 from it, or if we were to shift it a little bit. Let's just think about some interesting values here. Let's think about some interesting values. Let's think about what happens. We'll have x and y. Let's think about when x is equal to 2. I picked 2 because if x is equal to 2, you're saying log base 2 of 2, what power do I have to raise 2 to to get to 2? We'll have to raise it to the 1st power. What about when x is equal to ... Actually, let me do several of them. Let's do an x is equal to 8. Log base 2 of 8 is 3. I raise 2 to the 3rd power. I get 8. Let's do 4. Log base 2 of 4 is 2. 2 to the 2nd power is equal to 4. Let's do 2, where we started off with. That log base 2 of 2 is going to be 1. 2 to the 1st power is equal to 2. Now let's think about when x is equal to 1. We'd have to raise 2 too to get to 1. Well, I raise it to the 0th power. 2 to the 0th power is equal to 1. Now let's think about how we would get to 1/2. What do I have to raise 2 to to get to 1/2? 2 to the negative 1 power is going to be equal to 1/2, and I can keep going. What about 1/4? That's 2 to the negative 2 power is 1/4. I could go to 1/8. 2 to the negative 3 power is equal to 1/8. Now let's just graph some of these points. When x is equal to 8, y is equal to 3. When x is equal to 4, y is equal to 2. When x is equal to 2, y is equal to 1. When x is equal to 1, y is equal to 0. I think you see the general shape already forming. When x is 1/2, y is negative 1. When x is 1/4, y is negative 2. I think you see where this is going. When x is 1/8, y is negative 3. See, you have a graph that looks something like this. It looks something like this. I'm just connecting the dots. This is the behavior that we would expect. As x becomes really, really, really large, you think about what power do I have to raise 2 to, 2 to to get that x? Well, it's going to increase, but it's going to increase at an ever-decreasing rate. Then we see that as x approaches 0 from the right, to get closer and closer to 0, you have to raise 2 to more and more and more negative values, so the log, as we approach 0, it becomes very, very, very, very, very negative. We could never quite get to x equals 0. If you put an actual 0 right over here, what power would you have to raise 2 to to get to 0? Well, you can't. You could get close to 0 by raising 2 to a very, a very, very, very negative a very, very, very negative value, and this thing right over here is not going to be even defined for negative, for any, for non-positive x's. That's why we have it not defined for anything less than or equal to 0. This domain right over here is only for positive x's. That's log base 2 of x. How is this thing right over here, how does this thing right over here look different? Well, the obvious thing that jumps out at me is that it's flipped over the x-axis, so that's a pretty good sign that this is going ... we're going to have a negative log base 2 of x. Let's actually now graph. Let's graph that. What's y is equal to negative log base 2 of x going to look like? Each of these points, we're just going to flip it over, we're just going to flip it over the x-axis, so we're going to go there. We're going to go there. We're going to go there, and then this, this is going to go through that point right over here, and then let's see, instead of it 1/2, it's going to be like this. y equals negative log base 2 of x is going to look something like this. Let me see if I can draw it neatly. It's going to look something like this, something like this. We're getting close to the blue graph. That's y equals negative log base 2 of x. What's the difference between the green graph and the blue graph? If you look carefully, you see, you see that the blue graph is essentially the green graph shifted to the left by 2, shifted to the left. We've shifted it to the left by 2. At every one of these points, we have shifted to the left by 2. How do you shift to the left by 2? You would replace the x with an x plus 2. You would replace the x with an x plus 2. One way to think about it is in the original negative log base 2 of x, we see this asymptote at x equals 0. Now we're going to see the asymptote when this whole expression, x plus 2 is equal to 0, x plus 2 is equal to 0 when x is equal to negative 2. When x is equal to negative 2, you see the asymptote right over there. I encourage you, you could try values out if you like. You could essentially take all of these values. You could take all of these values and subtract 2 from them, and then when you add 2, you're going to get back to these values. If you shift to the left by 2, that's like replacing the x with an x plus 2. This is what is being graphed. Once again, try out the values if you don't believe me.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-3
" - Let's say that you've got a bag, and in that bag you put a bunch of marbles. So, let's say you put 50 of these magenta marbles. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, I'm not gonna draw all of them but you get the general idea. There are going to be 50 magenta marbles, and there's also going to be 50 blue marbles. And what you do is, you have these 100 marbles in there, half of them magenta, half of them blue. And before picking a marble out, and you're gonna be blindfolded when you pick a marble out, you shake the bag really good to, so you think, mix them up a little bit. And so, if you were to say theoretically, what is the probability, if you stuck your hand in and you're not looking, what is the probability of picking a magenta? I feel the need to write magenta in magenta. What is the probability of picking a magenta marble? Well, theoretically there's 100 equally likely possibilities, there's 100 marbles in the bag. And 50 of them involve picking a magenta. So, 50 out of 100, when this is the same thing as a 1/2 probability. So you could say, well, ""Theoretically, ""there is a 1/2 probability, I just did the math."" If you say these are 100 equally likely possibilities, 50 of them are picking magenta. Now let's say you actually start doing the experiment. So you literally take a bag with 50 magenta marbles, 50 blue marbles, and then you start picking the marbles, and then you see what marble color you picked, and you put it back in, and then you do it again. And so, let's say that after every time you put your hand in the bag and you take something out of the bag, and you observe what it is, we're gonna call that an experiment. So, after 10 experiments, let's say that you you have picked out seven magenta and three blue. So, is this strange that out of the first 10 experiments, you haven't picked out exactly half of them being magenta, you've picked out seven magenta, and then the other three were blue. Well no, this is definitely a reasonable thing. If the true probability of picking out a magenta is 1/2, it's definitely possible that you could still pick out seven magenta, that just happened to be what your fingers touched. And this isn't a lot of experiments, it's completely reasonable that out of 10, yeah, you could have, later on in statistics we'll define these things in more detail, but there's enough variation in where you might pick that you're not going to always get, especially with only 10 experiments, you're not definitely going to get exactly 1/2. Instead of having five magenta, it's completely reasonable to have seven magenta. So, this really wouldn't cause me a lot of pause. I still wouldn't question what I did here when I calculated this theoretical probability. But let's say you have a lot of time on your hands. And let's say after 10,000 trials here, after 10,000 experiments, and remember the experiment; you're sticking your hand in the bag without looking, your fingers kind of feeling around, picks out a marble, and you observe the marble and you record what you found. And so, let's say after 10,000 experiments, you get 7,000 magenta. Actually I'm gonna do slightly different numbers, so let me make it even more extreme. Let's say you get 8,000 magenta and you have 2,000 blue. Now this is interesting, because here what you're seeing experimentally seems to be very different. And now you have a large number of trials right over here, not just 10. 10 is completely reasonable that, hey you know, I got seven magenta and three blue instead of five and five, but now you've done 10,000. You would've expected if this was the true probability, you would've expected that half of these would've been magenta, only 5,000 magenta and 5,000 blue, but you got 8,000 magenta. Now, this is within the realm of possibility if the true probability of picking a magenta is 1/2, but it's very unlikely that you would've gotten this result with this many experiments, this many trials if the true probability was 1/2. Here your experimental probability is showing, look, out of 10,000 trials, experimental probability here is you had 10,000 trials, or 10,000 experiments I guess you could say. And and in 8,000 of them, you got a magenta marble. And so, this is going to be 80%, or 8/10. So, there seems to be a difference here. The reason why I would take this more seriously is that you had a lot of trials here, you did this 10,000 times. If the true probability was one half, it's very low likelihood that you would've gotten this many magenta. So, when you think about it you're like, ""What's going on here, what are ""possible explanations for this?"" This, I wouldn't have fretted about, after 10 experiments, not a big deal. But after 10,000, this would have caused me pause. Well, why would this happen, I mixed up the bag every time. And there're some different possibilities; maybe the blue marbles are slightly heavier, and so when you shake the bag up enough, the blue marbles settled to the bottom, and you're more likely to pick a magenta marble. Maybe the blue marbles have a slightly different texture to them, in which case, maybe they slip out of your hands, or they're less likely to be gripped on, and so you're more likely to pick a magenta. So, I don't know the explanation, I don't know what's going on in that bag, but if I thought theoretically that the probability should be 1/2, because half of the marbles are magenta, but I'm seeing through my experiments that 80% of what I'm picking out, especially if I did 10,000 of them, if I did this 10,000 times, well, this is going to cause me some pause. I would really start to think about whether it's truly equally likely for me to pick out a red, a magenta versus a blue. Something else must be going on.",math_7th-grade-illustrative-math_unit-8-probability-and-sampling
"  Welcome to the presentation on torque. So, if you watched the presentation on the center of mass, which you should have, you might have gotten a little bit of a glancing view of what torque is. And now we'll do some more in detail. So in general, from the center of mass video, we learned, if this is a ruler and this is the ruler's center of mass.  And if I were to apply force at the center of mass, I would accelerate the whole ruler in the direction of the force. If I have the force applying at the center of mass there, the whole ruler would accelerate in that direction. And we'd figure it out by taking the force we're applying to it and dividing by the mass of the ruler. And in that center of mass video, I imply-- well, what happens if the force is applied here? Away from the center of mass? Well, in this situation, the object, assuming it's a free floating object on the Space Shuttle or something, it will rotate around the center of mass. And that's also true, if we didn't use the center of mass, but instead we fixed the point. Let's say we had another ruler. Although it has less height than the previous one. Instead of worrying about its center of mass, let's say that it's just fixed at a point here. Let's say it's fixed here. So if this could be the hand of a clock, and it's nailed down to the back of the clock right there. So if we were trying to rotate it, it would always rotate around this point. And the same thing would happen. If I were to apply a force at this point, maybe I could break the nail off the back of the clock, or something, but I won't rotate this needle or this ruler, or whatever you want to call it. But if I would apply a force here, I would rotate the ruler around the pivot point. And this force that's applied a distance away from the pivot point, or we could say from the axis of rotation, or the center of mass. That's called torque. And torque, the letter for torque is this Greek, I think that's tau, it's a curvy T. And torque is defined as force times distance. And what force and what distance is it? It's the force that's perpendicular to the object. I guess you could say to the distance vector. If this is the distance vector-- let me do it in a different color. If this is the distance vector, the component of the force is perpendicular to this distance vector. And this is torque. And so what are its units? Well, force is newtons, and distance is meters, so this is newton meters. And you're saying, hey Sal, newtons times meters, force times distance, that looks an awful lot like work. And it's very important to realize that this isn't work, and that's why we won't call this joules. Because in work, what are we doing? We are translating an object. If this is an object, and I'm applying a force, I'm taking the force over the distance in the same direction as the force. Here the distance and the force are parallel to each other. You could say the distance vector and the force vector are in the same direction. Of course, that's translational. The whole object is just moving. It's not rotating or anything. In the situation of torque, let me switch colors. The distance vector, this is the distance from the fulcrum or the pivot point of the center of mass, to where I'm applying the force. This distance vector is perpendicular to the force that's being applied. So torque and work are fundamentally two different things, even though their units are the same. And this is a little bit of notational. This distance is often called the moment arm distance. And I don't know where that came from. Maybe one of you all can write me a message saying where it did come from. And often in some of your physics classes they'll often call torque as a moment. But we'll deal with the term torque. And that's more fun, because eventually we can understand concepts like torque horsepower in cars. So let's do a little bit of math, hopefully I've given you a little bit of intuition. So let's say I had this ruler. And let's say that this is its pivot point right here. So it would rotate around that point. It's nailed to the wall or something. And let's say that I apply a force-- Let's say the moment arm distance. So let's say this distance, let me do it in different color. Let's say that this distance right here is 10 meters. And I were to apply a force of 5 newtons perpendicular to the distance vector, or to dimension of the moment arm, you could view it either way. So torque is pretty easy in this situation. Torque is going to be equal to the force, 5 newtons, times the distance, 10. So it would be 50 newton meters. And you're probably saying, well, Sal, how do I know if this torque is going to be positive or negative? And this is where there's just a general arbitrary convention in physics. And it's good to know. If you're rotating clockwise torque is negative. Let me go the other way. If you were rotating counterclockwise, like we were in this example, rotating counterclockwise, the opposite direction of which a clock would move in. Torque is positive. And if you rotate clockwise the other way, torque is negative. So clockwise is negative. And I'm not going to go into the whole cross product and the linear algebra of torque right now, because I think that's a little bit beyond the scope. But we'll do that once we do more mathematically intensive physics. But, so, good enough. There's a torque of 50 newton meters. And that's all of the torque that is acting on this object . So it's going to rotate in this direction. And we don't have the tools yet to figure out how quickly it will rotate. But we know it will rotate. And that's vaguely useful. But what if I said that the object is not rotating? And that I have another force acting here? And let's say that that force is-- I don't know, let me make up something, that's 5 meters to the left of the pivot point.  If I were tell you that this object does not rotate. So if I tell you that the object is not rotating, that means the net torque on this ruler must be 0, because it's not-- its rate of change of rotation is not changing. I should be a little exact. If I'm applying some force here, and still not rotating, then we know that the net torque on this object is 0. So what is the force being applied here? Well, what is the net torque? Well, it's this torque, which we already figured out. It's going in the clockwise direction. So it's 5-- Let me do it in a brighter color. 5 times 10. And then the net torque. The sum of all the torques have to be equal to 0. So what's this torque? So let's call this f. This is the force. So, plus-- Well, this force is acting in what direction? Clockwise or counterclockwise? Well, it's acting in the clockwise direction. This force wants to make the ruler rotate this way. So this is actually going to be a negative torque. So let's say, put a negative number here times f, times its moment arm distance, times 5, and all of this has to equal 0. The net torque is 0, because the object's rate of change of rotation isn't changing, or if it started off not rotating, it's still not rotating. So here we get 50 minus 5 f is equal to 0. That's 50 is equal to 5 f. f is equal to 10. If we follow the units all the way through, we would get that f is equal to 10 newtons. So that's interesting. I applied double the force at half the distance. And it offsetted half the force at twice the distance. And that should all connect, or start to connect, with what we talked about with mechanical advantage. You could view it the other way. Let's say these are people applying these forces. Say this guy over here is applying 10 newtons. He's much stronger. He's twice as strong as this guy over here. But because this guy is twice as far away from the pivot point, he balances the other guy. So you can kind of view it as this guy having some mechanical advantage or having a mechanical advantage of 2. And watch the mechanical advantage videos if that confuses you a little bit. But this is where to torque is useful. Because if an object's rate of rotation is not changing, you know that the net torque on that object is 0. And you can solve for the forces or the distances. I'm about to run out of time, so I will see you in the next video. ",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-system-of-particles-and-rotational-motion
" In the last video, we saw that the quotient rule, which, once again, I have mixed feelings about because it really comes straight out of the product rule. If we have something in the form f of x over g of x, then the derivative of it could be this business right over here. So I thought I would at least do one example where we can apply that. And can could do it to find the derivative of something useful. So what's the derivative with respect to x-- let me write this a little bit neater-- the derivative with respect to x of tangent of x? And you might say, hey Sal, wait, I thought this was about the quotient rule. But you just have to remember, what is the definition of the tangent of x? Or what is one way to view the tangent of x? The tangent of x is the same thing as sine of x-- let me now color code it-- is the same thing as sine of x over cosine of x. And now it looks clear that our expression is the ratio or it's one function over another function. So now we can just apply the quotient rule. So all of this business is going to be equal to the derivative of sine of x times cosine of x. So what's the derivative of sine of x? Well, that's just cosine of x. So it's cosine of x is derivative of sine of x times whatever function we had in the denominator. So times cosine of x minus whatever function we had in the numerator, sine of x, times the derivative of whatever we have in the denominator. Well what's the derivative of cosine of x? Well the derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x. So we'll put the sine of x here. And it's a negative so I could just make this right over here a positive. And then all of that over, whatever was in the denominator squared, all of that over cosine of x squared. Now what does this simplify to? Well in the numerator right over here, we have cosine of x times cosine of x. So all of this simplifies to cosine squared of x. And sine of x times sine of x, that's just sine squared of x. And what's cosine squared of x plus sine squared of x? This is one of the most basic trigonometric identities. It comes straight out of the unit circle definition of trig functions. Let me write it over here. Cosine squared of x plus sine squared of x is equal to 1, which simplifies things quite nicely. So cosine squared of x plus sine squared of x, all of this entire numerator is equal to 1. So this nicely simplifies to 1 over cosine of x squared, which we could also write like this, cosine squared of x. These are two ways of writing cosine of x squared, which is the same exact thing as 1 over cosine of x squared, which is the same thing as secant. 1 over cosine of x is just secant of x. Secant of x squared, or we could write it like this. Secant squared of x. And so that's where it comes from. If you know that the derivative of sine of x is cosine of x and the derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x, we can use the quotient rule, which, once again, comes straight out of the product rule to find the derivative of tangent x is secant squared of x.",math_calculus-all-old_taking-derivatives-calc
" -  We have, listed here... We know that carbon 12 is the most common isotope of carbon on Earth. 98.89% of the carbon on Earth in carbon 12. And we know that, by definition, its mass is exactly 12 atomic mass units. Now that's not the only isotope of carbon on Earth. There are other isotopes. The next most frequent one is carbon 13. 1.11% of the carbon on Earth is carbon 13. And we can experimentally find that its mass is 13.0034 atomic mass units. So, these numbers that we have here, just as a review, these are atomic mass. These are atomic mass. And so, what we're gonna think about, in this video, is how do they come up with the atomic weight number that they'll give you on a periodic table like that? So, atomic weight. Where does that come from? Well, in the video on atomic weight and on atomic mass, we see that the atomic weight is the weighted average of the atomic masses of the various isotopes of that element. So, to find this roughly 12.01, we take the weighted average of these two things. And what do we weight it by? We weight it by how common that isotope actually is. So, what we wanna do is, we could take 98.89% and multiply it by 12. And I'll rewrite this percentage as a decimal. So it'll be 0.9889 times 12. And, to that, we are going to add... We are going to add 1.11% times 13.0034. So, as a decimal, that's going to be 0.011. That's 1.11% is 0.011, oh, 111. And I'm gonna multiply that times 13.0034 atomic mass units. So, what does that give us? Let's get our calculator out here. So, we are going to have 0.9889 times 12 is equal to 11.8668. And, to that, we are going to add... We are going to add 0.0111 times 13.0034. And I know it's going to do this multiplication first because it's a calculator knows about order of operations. And so, that's all going to be, as you can see, 12.01113774, which, if you were to round to the hundredths place, is how this atomic weight was gotten. So that's that. There you go. That's how we calculate atomic weight. So, I can write this as approximately 12.01. It's the weighted average of the atomic masses. Now, another thing that you might want to note is, what's the difference between carbon 12 and carbon 13? Carbon 12, this right over here, is six protons. The six protons are what make it carbon, so both of these will have six protons. And the difference is in the neutrons. This right over here has six neutrons, six neutrons. And this, right over here, is gonna have one more neutron, seven neutrons. So, when you look at the difference in atomic mass, notice the change is... Looks like it's plus 1.0034 atomic mass units. So, from this, you can say, ""Hey, look, if I add a neutron... Plus one neutron. Plus one neutron. It's roughly equal to an atomic mass unit."" It's not exactly an atomic mass unit, but, roughly speaking, in a lot of very broad, high-level terms, you can kind of view it as being very close to one atomic mass unit. And the same thing is true of protons. Anyway, hopefully you now have an appreciation for the difference between atomic mass, which is the mass, and atomic weight, which is the weighted average of the various isotopes of that element on Earth, how to calculate it, and roughly what the mass of a neutron is.",science_chemistry_atomic-structure-and-properties
" We're asked, how many inches are in 4 and 1/2 yards? And we'll do it a couple of ways. One, we could just say how many inches are in 4 yards and how many inches are in a 1/2 of a yard? And this really 4 plus 1/2 yards. Or we could convert this into an improper fraction first and then convert. But before I even do that, let's just think about how many inches there are in a yard. So if I have 1 yard, we know that there are 3 feet for every 1 yard, Right? And when you say, why am I multiplying by 3 instead of saying there's 1 yard for every 3 feet? And the easiest way to think about it is you're going to have a larger value over here, and you're also going to want to have these units right over here cancel out. So yard is canceling out with yard. So you have 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, which is kind of what we already knew. I'm just showing you how the dimensions cancel out. And how many inches are there per foot? Well, we know that there are 12 inches for every 1 foot. And same logic over here, inches is a smaller unit of measurement so it makes sense that we're multiplying by 12. 3 feet is going to be more inches, so we're multiplying by 12. And also these units cancel out-- foot in the numerator, foot in the denominator. 3 times 12 divided by 1 is equal to 36 inches. So you might have already known it. But this is nice to have the dimensions cancel out like this. We know that 1 yard is equal to 36 inches. Or there are 36 inches for every 1 yard. And so we can now either break this down, or we can turn this into an improper fraction. First I'll just break it down into 4 yards plus 1/2 yards. So we could say that this is 4 yards. So 4 yards is going to be equal to-- well, let's just multiply it times 36 inches, 36 inches for every 1 yard. The yards cancel out. 4 times 36 is 120, plus 24, so that's 144. So this is equal to 144 inches. That's just the 4 yards. And then if we do the 1/2 yards, so 1/2 of a-- I guess I say 1/2 yard, once again, times 36 inches per yard, the yards cancel out. 1/2 times 36 is going to be equal to 18 inches. So 4 and 1/2 yards is the same thing as 4 yards plus 1/2 yards, which is the same thing as 144 inches plus 18 inches, which is going to give us-- let's just add it up over here on the right, 144 plus 18. 4 plus 8 is 12. 4 plus 1 is 5. You have this 1 up here, so it's 6, and then we have a 1. So when you add them all together, you get 162 inches. The other way to do this would have been to convert this into an improper fraction and then multiply by the unit. So let's do it that way. If I have 4 and 1/2 of anything, really-- so let me write 4 and 1/2. I'm trying to find a suitable color. So if I have 4 and 1/2, this is the same thing-- 4 is the same thing as 8/2. This is the same thing-- so let me write it this way. 4 and 1/2 is the same thing as 4 plus 1/2, which is the same thing as-- if we want to have the same denominator as this 2 over here or as this 1/2 over here, this is the same thing as 8/2. Or you could say 4/1 is the same thing as 8/2, if we want to have a common denominator, so 8/2 plus 1/2. Actually, let me write it that way, just so you really understand what we're doing. 4 is the same thing as 4/1. So it's 4/1 plus 1/2. If we want to find a common denominator, it's 2. So 4/1 is the same thing as 8/2 plus 1/2, which is equal to 9/2. Now, I did it this way, which takes longer, just so you really understand how we converted it, why it makes-- hopefully conceptually why it just makes intuitive sense, why 4 and 1/2 is the same thing as 9/2. But if you want a simple process for it, you could just say, look, 4 times 2 is 8. 8 plus 1 is 9. And that gives you that 9 right over there, so 9/2. So we have 9/2 yards that we want to convert to inches. Same process-- times 36 inches per yard. Yard in the numerator, yard in the denominator. We are left with 9/2 times 36. We could say times 36/1 if we like, 36 Inches for every 1 yard. 36-- or the number 36 really is the same as 36/1. And then we're left with just inches in our units. We're just left with inches. And over here there's several ways that we can simplify it. Probably the easiest way to simplify it is we can divide both our numerator and our denominator by 2. So let me write it this way. I don't want to skip steps. So we have 9 times 36 over 2 times 1, or over 2 inches. And we can divide the numerator and the denominator by 2 to simplify it. They're both divisible by 2. 36 divided by 2 is 18. 2 divided by 2 is 1. So we're really just left with 9 times 18 inches. We can just multiply 9 times 18. Let me do it over here. 18 times 9. 8 times 9 is 72. 1 times 9 is 9, plus 7 is 16, so we get 162 inches. So all of this simplifies to 162 inches, and we are done.",math_5th-engage-ny_engage-5th-module-2
" Let's take 63 and divide it by 35. So the first thing that we might say is, OK, well, 35 doesn't go into 6. It does go into 63. It goes into 63 one time, because 2 times 35 is 70, so that's too big. So it goes one time. So let me write that. 1 times 35 is 35. And then if we were to subtract and we can regroup up here, we can take a 10 from the 60, so it becomes a 50, give that 10 to the 3, so it becomes a 13. 13 minus 5 is 8. 5 minus 3 is 2. So you could just say, hey, 63 divided by 35-- let me write this. You could say 63 divided by 35 is equal to 1 remainder 28. But this isn't so satisfying. We know that the real answer is going to be one point something, something, something. So what I want to do is keep dividing. I want to divide this thing completely and see what type of a decimal I actually get. And to do that, I essentially have to add a decimal here and then just keep bringing down decimal places to the right of the decimal. So 63 is the exact same thing as 63.0, and I could add as many zeroes as I might want to add here. So what we could do is we just make sure that this decimals right over there, and we can now bring down a zero from the tenths place right over here. And you bring down that zero, and now we ask ourselves, how many times does 35 go into 280? And, as always, this is a bit of an art when you're dividing a two-digit number into a three-digit number. So let's see, it's definitely going to be-- if I were to say-- so 40 goes into 280 seven times. 30 goes into 280 about nine times. It's going to be between 7 and 9, so let's try 8. So, let's see what 35 times 8 is. 35 times 8. 5 times 8 is 40, 3 times 8 is 24, plus 4 is 28. So it actually works out perfectly. So 35 goes into 280 exactly eight times. 8 times 5, we already figured it out. 8 times 35 is exactly 280, and we don't have any remainder now, so we don't have to bring down any more of these zeroes. So now we know exactly that 63 divided by 35 is equal to exactly 1.8.",math_6th-engage-ny_engage-6th-module-2
" I'm going to tell you about a number that's cooler than pi, more mysterious than the golden ratio, weirder than e or i. Somehow in recent times, we seem to have forgotten about just how incredible this number is, yet many ancient cultures knew of it. Some even worshipped it. It was known to Pythagoras, Ptolemy, and Zeno of Elea. It was independently discovered in East Asia and there's even evidence that the Aztecs were aware of it. It's pretty different from most other numbers you've heard of, but today's mathematicians are becoming increasingly fascinated by this ancient concept. And I want to bring back into the common knowledge how cool, how amazing, this number really is. A fitting name for this number is the obsolete Greek letter digamma, which originally represented a w sound was called wau. Trying to write wau in decimal notation is, I think, a misleading exercise, which distracts from the nature of the number itself. One difficulty is that there's actually more than one way to represent it as an infinite decimal. But wau can be defined in some unconventional ways. Take this unusual fractal fraction. How would you find out what this equals? Let's see if it converges to something. If you had just one layer, it would be 2 over 4 or 1/2. Take two layers and it's 3/4 plus 1/4, that's 4/4. So this is 2 over 1, or just 2. Add another layer, that's 3 over 1 plus 1 over 1, 2 over 4 again. And for any finite number of layers, it will be one of those. But it turns out if you continue this fraction on to infinity you get neither 2 over 1, nor 1 over 2, but the curious number wau. Here's another way to write wau. Wau equals 5/6 plus all over 6, 5/6 plus all over 6 5/6 plus all over 6, 5/6, and so on. This infinite fractal quality of wau lets you do some really crazy stuff. Take this. Wau to the wau to the wau to do way, but this is wau times wau. It's all wau times wau-- I don't even know how to pronounce this, but infinite fractal exponentiation of wau loops back and equals wau. I mean, that's just wau. And wau does have an intimate relationship with other special numbers. Check this out. Wau to the pi, to the wau to the 2 pi, to the wau to the 4 pi, to the wau to the 8 pi, and so on, equals wau times square root wau, times cube root wau times, and so on. I mean, this isn't much more mind boggling than thinking about what might happen if you try to raise a number to an imaginary power. Speaking of which e to the 2 i pi equals wau. Relatedly, you can find wau in calculus. The derivative of e to the wau equals wau e. And e to i, to the e i o is e to the wau to the tau wau wau. You might be tempted to try and solve these things using logarithms, but when you try to take log base wau, it kind of doesn't work. It's like dividing by 0. Cool, right? People talk about the geometry of the golden ratio as a bit special, but it's actually pretty normal. Normal numbers you can make a rectangle with that proportion just fine. Make the proportion wau, and well, you get something that most people wouldn't call a rectangle unless you're a mathematician and being technical. But if x and y are the size of a wau rectangle, meaning if x over y is wau, then x plus x to the y, over y plus y to the x, equals wau. And now if I take the previous two, x to the x to the y, and down here, y to the y to the x. This equals wau. And if I make the next term take just the previous two, x to the y to x to the x the y, and y to x to the y to the y to the x. This also equals wau. And you can keep going and get these non repeating patterns related to the Fibonacci sequence. And this will all work out to wau for any numbers x and y, where x over y is wau. Yeah, wau is awesome. You can make an equiangular spiral when you make the angle phi as you go around and get a golden spiral, pretty straightforward. But wau is such a weird number, if you try and make the angle wau, then the spiral curls up infinitely on itself, collapsing and entangling like a quantum string. Wau, in fact, shows up in physics, too. E to the wau divided by m c squares equals wau squared. And wau shows up everywhere in nature. I mean everywhere, every single flower or tree you see embodies wau. But instead of going on about that, I'll just give you one more crazy concept. Just imagine that you took a number to the power of a number to the power of a number all the way to infinity and then beyond infinity, so far that it came back down and became the number's root of the number's root of the number's root of, all the way past infinity until it gets back around to the beginning. It's not a notion that even makes sense according to standard mathematics. But if you make this number wau, it actually becomes possible to argue that all this equals 1. What amazing properties of wau can you come up with?",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_vi-hart
" -  In this video we are going to introduce ourselves to the idea of permutations, which is a fancy word for a pretty straight forward concept, which is what are the number of ways that we can arrange things? How many different possibilities are there? And to make that a little bit tangible, let's have an example with say a sofa. My sofa can seat exactly three people. I have seat number one on the left of the sofa, seat number two in the middle of the sofa, and seat number three on the right of the sofa. And let's say we're going to have three people who are going to sit in these three seats, person A, person B, and person C. How many different ways can these three people sit in these three seats? Pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. Well, there's several ways to approach this. One way is just try to think through all of the possibilities. You could do it systematically. You could say alright, if I have person A in seat number one, then I could have person B in seat number two, and person C in seat number three. And I could think of another situation. If I have person A in seat number one, I could then swap B and C. So it could look like that. And that's all of the situations, all of the permutations where I have A in seat number one. So now let's put someone else in seat number one. So now let's put B in seat number one, and I could put A in the middle and C on the right. Or I could put B in seat number one, and then swap A and C. So C and then A. And then if I put C in seat number one, well I could put A in the middle and B on the right. Or with C in seat number one, I could put B in the middle and A on the right. And these are actually all of the permutations and you can see that there are one, two, three, four, five, six. Now this wasn't too bad. And in general, if you're thinking about permutations of six things or three things in three spaces, you can do it by hand. But it could get very complicated if I said, hey, I have 100 seats and I have 100 people that are going to sit in them. How do I figure it out mathematically? Well the way that you would do it, and this is going to be a technique that you can use for really any number of people and any number of seats is to really just build off of what we just did here. What we did here is we started with seat number one and we said alright, how many different possibilities are, how many different people could sit in seat number one assuming no one has sat down before. Well, three different people could sit in seat number one. You could see it right over here. This is where A is sitting in seat number one, this is where B is sitting in seat number one, and this is where C is sitting in seat number one. Now for each of those three possibilities, how many people can sit in seat number two? Well, we saw when A sits in seat number one, there's two different possibilities for seat number two. When B sits in seat number one, there's two different possibilities for seat number two. When C sits in seat number one, this is a tongue-twister, there's two different possibilities for seat number two. And so, you're gonna have two different possibilities here. Another way to think about it is, one person has already sat down here, there's three different ways of getting that, and so there's two people left who could sit in the second seat and we saw that right over here, where we really wrote out the permutations. And so how many different permutations are there for seat number one and seat number two? Well, you would multiply. For each of these three you have two, for each of these three in seat number one, you have two in seat number two. And then what about seat number three? Well, if you know who's in seat number one and seat number two, there's only one person who can be in seat number three. And another way to think about it, if two people have already sat down, there's only one person who could be in seat number three. And so mathematically, what we could do is just say three times two times one. And you might recognize the mathematical operation factorial, which literally just means hey, start with that number, and then keep multiplying it by the numbers one less than that and then one less than that all the way until you get to one. And this is three factorial, which is going to be equal to six, which is exactly what we got here. And to appreciate the power of this, let's extend our example. Let's say that we have five seats. One, two, three, four, five. And we have five people, person A, B, C, D, and E. How many different ways can these five people sit in these five seats? Pause this video and figure it out. Well, you might immediately say well that's going to be five factorial, which is going to be equal to five times four times three times two times one. Five times four is 20. 20 times three is 60. And then 60 times two is 120. And then 120 times one is equal to 120. And once again, that makes a lot of sense. If no one's sat down, there's five different possibilities for seat number one. And then for each of those possibilities, there's four people who could sit in seat number two. And then for each of those 20 possibilities in seat numbers one and two, well there's gonna be three people who could sit in seat number three. And for each of these 60 possibilities, there's two people who can sit in seat number four. And then once you know who's in the first four seats, you know who has to sit in that fifth seat. And that's where we got that 120 from.",math_precalculus_prob-comb
" Use the associative law of addition to write the expression. We have a 77 plus 2 in parentheses, plus 3, in a different way. Simplify both expressions to show they have identical results. So this associative law of addition, which sounds very fancy and complicated, literally means that you can associate these three numbers in different ways or you can add them in different orders. Now let me just make that clear. So the way they wrote it right here, they wrote it 77 plus 2 in parentheses, and then they wrote plus 3. These parentheses mean do the 77 plus 2 before you add the 3. So if you were to evaluate this, you would evaluate what's in the parentheses first. So you would say, well, 77 plus 2, that's 79, so everything in the parentheses just evaluates to 79. And then you still have that plus 3. And 79 plus 3 is 82, so this is equal to 82. That's if you just evaluate it the way that they gave it to us. Now, the associative law of addition tells us it doesn't matter whether we add 77 and 2 first or whether we add 2 and 3 first. We can associate them differently. So this is going to be the exact same thing. This is the exact same thing as-- we could write it this way. Let me write them all. 77 plus 2 plus 3. If we have no parentheses here, this is actually the same thing as this over here, because we'd go 77 plus 2 is 79 plus 3 is 82. But the associative law tells as, well, you know what? I could do 77 plus 2 plus 3. I could add this first and then add it to 77, and it's going to be the exact same thing as if I added these two guys first and then add the 3. Let's verify that for ourselves. So 2 plus 3 is 5, so this evaluates to 77 plus 5. And 77 plus 5, once again, is 82. So it doesn't matter how you associate the numbers. Either way, you get 82. And that's the associative law of addition.",math_pre-algebra_pre-algebra-arith-prop
" -  All right, I'm going to tell you about the Decibel Scale. This is the scale that we use to figure out the loudness of a sound. The equation that goes along with it looks like this. Beta equals 10 log, or logarithm, base 10 of I divided by 10 to the negative 12 watts per square meter. This looks intimidating. Let's talk about it and break it down. Beta is the number of decibels. So this side gives you the number of decibels and we abbreviate decibel with a little d, capital B. This is the number of dBs or decibel. You've probably seen this number on your stereo. Somewhere reader just in volume because we're going to measure volume and Decibels. 10, this 10 just denotes the fact that this is the Deci-bel Scale and not just the bel scale. If you didn't multiply by 10, you'd have the bel scale but this is multiplied by 10. We like the 10. We're going to call is Decibel. Log, we'll talk about log in a minute. Logarithm here. I is the intensity of the sound wave. So this is the intensity. In Physics, intensity is defined to be the power divided by the area. What this means, think about it this way. You got your ear and a sound wave, say, is coming toward your ear. If you imagine, one. Power's in, what? Power measure going to watts. Area's measure going to square meter. So think about intensity this way. If you have one square meter. Imagine one square meter of area here. This doesn't have to be an actual physical object. Just imagine a square meter of area. The power that passes through that area will be, how many joules? If you figure you how many joules pass through this one square meter. If you asked how many joules per second pass through that one square meter. How many joulels of sound energy per second pass through the one square meter? That would be the number of watts per meter squared which would be the intensity. So watts is joules per second. This gives you an idea of how much energy per second pass through a certain amount of area. This part of the equation is my favorite. This is my all-time favorite right here. This number. This 10 to the negative 12 watts per square meter represents the threshold of human hearing. What that means is this is the softest possible sound you can hear. Any sound with an intensity less than that. You won't even notice. But if it's anything bigger than that, a human ear that's healthy should be able to detect it. Here is why I like this number. This is unbelievably small. This is one trillion of a watt per meter square. A trillion. What this says is that even if only one trillionth of a joule per second passes through the square meter, your ear would still be able to detect the sound that soft. If that doesn't impress you, let me put it to you this way. Imagine we did have one watt. Let me put it to you this way. If you have one watt, how big of an area? A watt isn't really that much. A watt is not a lot of power. If you have one watt, how big could you make this area? How, spread out. How diluted could one watt be spread over? How large of an area could this one watt be spread over and still be intense enough for the human ear to hear it? What do you think? Football field? I don't know, a city? No, it turns out. If you do the calculation, I suggest you do it. It's interesting. You would get, that you can spread one watt over the entire land area of Germany, about three times over, and still it's intense enough for the human ear to hear. That's how unbelievably sensitive our ears are. It's actually... I told you it's unbelievable. I can hardly believe it myself. Let's come back over to here. So here's our equation. This is the Decibel Scale. Why log? That's what you're thinking. ""Why in God's name did the physicist have ""to put logarithm in here? ""This scare me."" This used to scare me too. Well, I'll show you why. Here's the problem. The fact that we can hear such a soft sound, 10 to the negative 12 watts per meter squared, there's a huge range of human hearing. This means we can hear from 10 to the negative 12 watts per square meter. This is your point zero, zero, say three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, with a one watts per square meter all the way where there's no upper limit. It just blow out your ears. But once you get to about one watt per square meter, this one will start hurting. This is painful. You're not going to be happy over here. You're just going to start hurting. You'll start getting hearing losses and not good. So it's a huge range. 12 orders of magnitude. This one watt per square meter is a trillion times bigger than this side. This scale is just way too big. This is awkward. We want to scale that's small or maybe like one to 100 to measure loudness. We don't want to measure from one to a trillion or a trillion to one. That's what log's going to do. Logs are great. This is a trick for this use. This is why I love this trick. Logarithms take really big or really small numbers and turn them into nice numbers. That's why we're going to use the logarithm. Let me show you what I mean. Logarithm, if you don't remember, here's what a logarithm does. Log base 10 of a number equals, here's what it does. I'm going to stick a number in here. Let's stick 100000. What log does, log is a curious guy. Log is always asking a question. Log always wants to know, okay, if I'm log base 10, log wants to know what number would I raise 10 to in order to get this number in here. So log looks at this number in the parentheses. This entire number here and asks what number should I raise 10 to in order to get 100000. Well, we know the answer to that. We should raise 10 to the fifth. If I raise 10 to the fifth, I'll get 100000. So if five is the number I raised 10 to get 100000, then that's the answer to this that log base 10 of 100000 is five. Look what happened. Log took a huge number, 100000, and turned it into five. Well, that's outstanding. Log can take huge numbers, turn them into nice numbers. The logarithm base 10 of one billion would be... One billion is a big number. That's hard to deal with but log takes 10 and asks what number can I raise 10 to in order to get a billion. I should raise 10 to the ninth because I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine zeros here. I raised 10 to the ninth to get this number. So the answer to this question for the logarithm is nine. Oops, that's not nine. Nine, and that's why logarithms are good. Logarithm took this enormous number of billion and turned it into nine. So logarithms take enormous scales turn them in nine scales. That's why we like this formula which is our Decibel Scale because it takes enormous intensities and small intensities, turns them into nice intensities. Let me show you an example with this equation really quick. Let's say you're talking to your friend. Maybe you're yelling at your friend. You guys are having a heated exchange. You're yelling. He's next to you. These are the sound waves coming at him. You're yelling with an intensity of, say 10 to the negative fifth. That doesn't sound like a lot but that's actually, you're pretty upset here. That's pretty loud. I want to know how many decibels is this. How do we figure out the decibels? Well, here's what we do. We use our formula for decibels. Beta, number of decibels, equals 10 log base 10 of the intensity over always 10 to the negative 12 watts per square meter because that's the softest sound we can hear. What do I get? 10 to the negative fifth is my intensity. So I plug this into here. I'm going to get beta equals 10 times the log base 10 of 10 to the negative fifth, because that's my intensity, divided by 10 to the negative 12. Now these are both watts per square meter. So let's cancel. Well, what's 10 to the negative fifth divided by 10 to the negative 12 turns out that's 10 to the seventh. I end up with 10 log of 10 to the seventh. Now I don't like logs. I'll be honest. They freak me out but I can even do this one. Log of 10 to the seventh. Remember what log does. It asks what number do I raise 10 to in order to get the thing in the parentheses. Well, the number I raise 10 to to get the thing in this parentheses, it's already 10 to the seventh. It's already in this form. So I've raised 10 to the seventh to get 10 to the seventh. So the answer to log base 10 1of 10 to the seventh is just seven. 1My final answer beta, the loudness, 1the number of decibels is going to be 10 times 1log of 10 to the seventh was just seven 1because I have to raise 10 to the seventh 1to get 10 to the seventh. 110 times seven equals 70. 1I'm yelling at 70 decibels. 1I need to calm down. 1My friend's going to start getting mad at me. 1That's how you figure out how loud the sound wave is.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-11th-physics-waves
" Let's start with our classic system that I keep using over and over again. And that's because it tends to be very useful for instruction. It also tends to be the system that is most covered in classrooms. So hopefully it'll be productive for you and your school work. So I have this container. It has a movable piston on top, or kind of a movable ceiling. Well, of course, inside of my system I have a bunch of molecules or atoms bouncing around, creating some type of pressure on the system. So let's say it has some pressure, P1. This volume right here, let's call that V1. And let's say it also has some temperature that it starts off with. Everything is in equilibrium. Remember these are macro states. The only way I can even tell you what the volume, or the pressure, or the temperature is, is if the system is in equilibrium, if everything in it is uniform. The temperature is consistent throughout. Fair enough. And in order to keep it placed down, I have to put some rocks on top. And I've done this in multiple processes so far. And, of course, I'm doing these little pebbles, because I'm going to remove them slowly. Because I want to approximate a quasi-static process. Or I want to approximate a system that's always close enough to equilibrium that I'm cool with defining our macro states, our pressure, our temperature, or our volume. Let me write V for volume. Now, in this video, I'm going to study what's called an isothermic process. And really what it just means is, I'm going to keep the temperature the same. Iso- just means the same. You probably remember when we studied the periodic table. Isotopes, those are the same element just with different mass numbers. So this is the same temperature we're going to run our process. So my question is, how can we do that? Because as I remove pebbles, what's going to happen? If I just did this, without any-- if it was completely isolated from the world. And actually I'll add in a word right here. If it was an adiabatic process-- If it was adiabatic-- fancy word. All that means is, completely isolated from the world. So no heat is going into or out of this system. If this was the case, what would happen as I released or I took away some of these little particles? Let me copy and paste it. Well, let me just redraw it actually. So I have my one wall. I have another wall. I have another wall. As I release a couple of pebbles, one at a time, my volume is going to increase. So I'm going to have a slightly higher volume. My volume's going to go up. I have fewer pebbles here now. And since I have the same number of molecules, they're going to bump into this less. So pressure is going to go down. Volume is going to go up. And if I was adiabatic, if I had no extra heat being added to the system, what do I know is going to happen to the temperature? Well, think about it this way. Some work was done, right? Our old ceiling was maybe some place around here. We pushed it up with some force for some distance. So we did work. And so we changed some kinetic energy, or we transferred some kinetic energy, out of the system. That's essentially what the work did. That kinetic energy was turned into work. And temperature is just a macro measure of average kinetic energy. In fact, we just-- well, I won't go into it. But in the last video, the kind of proof you want-- if you didn't watch it because you didn't want to go through the math, which is completely fair enough because it normally wouldn't be done in an intro chemistry class-- I showed that the internal energy is equal to the total kinetic energy, which was equal to 3/2 times the number of moles, times R, times temperature. So temperature is just, by some scaling factor, a measure of kinetic energy. Now, when I do some work, it's essentially a transfer of kinetic energy. And I can't replace that energy with some heat because it's adiabatic. There's no heat going into or out of the system. So in that situation, the kinetic energy of the system went down. The average kinetic energy of the system went down. So the temperature would've also gone down. And actually, just as a bonus point, what happened to the internal energy? Well, the internal energy is the total kinetic energy of the system. And I could even right down the original formula. Change in internal energy is equal to change-- let me not do that, because I said I shouldn't-- is equal to heat added to the system, minus work done by the system. This is work done by the system. That's why we're subtracting it. Now, it's adiabatic, so there's no heat added to the system. So the change in internal energy is equal to the minus the work done by the system. Well, in this situation, the system did do work. It pushed this piston up by some distance with some force. So, your delta U is negative. It's less than 0. So U went down, and that makes sense. If temperature changed, then the internal energy is going to change. And for our simple system, where internal energy is represented by the kinetic energy of these molecules, that's always going to be the case. If temperature doesn't change, internal energy won't change. If temperature goes up, internal energy goes up. If temperature goes down, internal energy goes down. And, of course, they're not the same thing, though. The difference between internal energy and temperature is the scaling factor, 3/2 times the number of molecules, times our ideal gas constant. So fair enough. I went through this whole exercise just to show you that if I was completely isolated, and if I removed a couple of these pebbles, that my temperature is going to go down. Now, I told you already that I want to do an isothermic process. So I want to do this process while keeping the temperature the same. So how can I do that? Well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to place my system on top of what we'll call, a reservoir. So a reservoir, you can kind of view as an infinitely large amount of something that is the temperature that we started off with. So this reservoir is T1. So even though if, I took two relative things of comparable size. That says, temperature A. This is temperature B. And I've put them next to each other. They're going to average out to A plus B over 2, whatever their temperatures are. But if B is massive-- if A is just a speck of particle-- let's say it's iron dust-- while B is the Eiffel Tower, then essentially B's temperature will not change a lot. A will just become B's temperature. Now, a reservoir is theoretically infinitely large. It's an infinitely large object. So if something is next to a reservoir and is given enough time, it'll always assume the heat of the reservoir, or the temperature of the reservoir. So what's going to happen? So this is adiabatic, but now I'm actually putting it next to a reservoir. So this isn't going to happen. The adiabatic situation isn't going to happen. Now, I'm going to have a situation where I'm going to stay the same temperature. So what's that going to look like on the PV diagram? So let me draw the PV diagram. This is my pressure. This is my volume. So this is my starting point right here. And what I'm saying is, if I'm doing an isothermic process, so I just keep removing these pebbles. So I start at this state right here. Let me copy and paste it since I've done so much art already here. So I'm going from there to here where I'm removing a couple of the particles. So let's say I've removed a couple of them over here. And because of that, I've increased the volume. So let's say the volume, it's not there anymore. Let's say it's a little bit higher. Let's say the volume is-- just for the sake of our discussion-- let's say the volume has expanded a little bit, because I've remove some particles, the little pebbles on the top keeping it down. So it's like the adiabatic process, but instead of the temperature going down, my temperature stays at T1. My temperature's at T1 the entire time, because I'm next to this theoretical thing called a reservoir. So because of that, I will travel along what we'll call an isotherm. So this is my first state. When I'm done, I might end up some place over here. And so this is state 2. So this is state 2, this is state 1. What I'm claiming is that my path along this is going to be on some type of a rectangular hyperbola, or at least part of it. If I were to add rocks to it and compress it, I claim that my PV diagram would go like this. If I were to keep removing rocks from this diagram, I claim that my PV diagram would keep going like that. And so what's the intuition? That if I keep the temperature constant, that I'm essentially moving along this hyperbola. Well, let's just take out the ideal gas formula. Let me box off all this stuff over here. If I just take the ideal gas formula, PV is equal to nRT. If T is constant-- we know that R is a constant, it's the ideal gas constant. We know that we're not changing the number of moles 1of particles. 1Then that means that PV is equal to some constant. 1This whole thing is equal to some constant. 1And then, if we wanted to write P as a function of V, we 1would just write P is equal to K over V. 1Now, this might not look 100% familiar to you, but if I 1wrote it in algebraic terms, if I told you to graph y is 1equal to 1 over x, what does that look like? 1That's a rectangular hyperbola. 1That looks like this. 1And this is the y-axis, that's the x-axis, at least in this 1quadrant it looks like this. 1It also looks like that in the third quadrant, but we won't 1worry about that too much. 1So whenever you hold temperature constant, you're 1on some rectangular hyperbola like this, like an isotherm. 1Now, if the temperature was a different temperature, if it 1was a lower temperature, you'd be on a different isotherm. 1So you would be on an isotherm that looked like 1this, maybe over here. 1It would also be a rectangular hyperbola 1but at a lower state. 1Why is that? 1Because, if you're at a lower temperature, for any volume, 1you should have a lower pressure and that works out. 1That's why this is some temperature T2, that 1is lower than T1. 1So I want to do a couple of things in this video. 1I inadvertently explained to you what an adiabatic process 1is, and why the temperature would naturally go down on its 1own if you didn't have this reservoir here. 1But the whole reason why I even thought about doing this 1video is because I wanted you get comfortable with this idea 1of, one, that a reservoir will keep you in kind of an 1isothermic state. 1It will keep the temperature the same. 1And that if you keep the temperature the same, that you 1will travel along this isotherm, these rectangular 1hyperbolas. 1And that each temperature has 1associated with it an isotherm. 1So if you take that, let's just do one more step. 1And let's think about the actual work we did by 1traveling from this state to this state. 1Or if you just want to think of it in visual terms, from 1removing our pebbles slowly and slowly with this reservoir 1down here the whole time, from this state to this state. 1Where our volume has increased, our pressure has-- 1So our volume has increased. 1Our pressure has gone down. but our temperature has stayed 1the same the entire time. 1So, several videos ago, we learned that the work done is 1the area under this graph. 1It's the area under that graph. 1Or, if we want to do in calculus terms-- and I'm about 1to break into calculus, so if you don't want to see calculus 1cover your eyes or ears. 1It would be the integral. 1And the rest of this video will be a little bit mathy, 1and I guess I should make that statement on the 1title of the video. 1But if I want to calculate what this area is, 1I can now do this. 1The isotherm assumption makes our math a little bit easier. 1Because we know that PV is equal to nRT, ideal gas law. 1Or we could say P, if we divide both sides by V, is 1equal to nRT, divided by V. 1So there we have it. 1We have P as a function of V. 1This function right here, this graph right here, is this. 1We could write P as a function of v is equal to nRT over V. 1So if we want to figure out the area under the curve, we 1just integrate this function from our starting, our V1 to 1our ending point, to our V2. 1So what is that going to be? 1Well, we're going to integrate from V1 to V2. 1Actually, that shouldn't be an equal. 1The work is going to be the integral from V1 to V2, times 1our function, P as a function of V, times dV. 1We're summing up all of the little rectangles here. 1We did that a couple of videos ago. 1So what's P as a function of V? 1So work done is equal to, from V1 to V2, nRT 1over V, times dV. 1Now, this is our simplifying assumption. 1We said we're sitting on top of a reservoir. 1That this reservoir keeps our temperature the 1same the whole time. 1And we're going to learn in a second, it's doing that by 1transferring heat into the system. 1And we're going to calculate how much heat is transferred 1into the system. 1So, if we look at this right here, temperature-- since 1we're assuming we're on an isotherm, is a constant. n and 1R are definitely constants. 1So we can rewrite this integral as the integral from 1V1 to V2 of 1 over V, dV. 1And then we could put the nRT out here. 1I should have done that first. nRT, it's 1just a constant term. 1Now, what's the antiderivative of 1 over V? 1It's the natural log of V. 1So our work is equal to nRT times the natural log-- this 1is the antiderivative-- of V, evaluated at V2 minus it 1evaluated at V1. 1So that is equal to nRT times, evaluated at V2, so the 1natural log of V2. 1Minus the natural log of V1. 1Now we know from logarithm properties is the same thing 1as nRT times the natural log of V2 over V1. 1So there you have it, we actually 1calculated the real value. 1If we know our starting volume and our finishing volume, we 1can actually figure out the work done in 1this isothermic process. 1The work done in this isothermic process is the area 1under this. 1And we figured out what it was. 1By pushing up that piston, it was nRT. 1These are the number of moles we have, ideal gas constant. 1Our temperature that we're sitting on. 1It would be T1 in this case. 1And the natural log of our finishing volume divided by 1our starting volume. 1Now, let me ask a follow-up question. 1How much heat was put into the system by this isotherm here? 1It put in heat to keep the temperature up, otherwise the 1temperature would have gone down, right? 1Heat was going into the system the entire time. 1How much was it? 1Well, since it's an isotherm, since the temperature did not 1change, what do we know about the internal energy? 1Did the internal energy change? 1The temperature not changing told us that the kinetic 1energy didn't change. 1If the kinetic energy didn't change, then the internal 1energy did not change. 1And we know that the change in internal energy is equal to 1the heat put into the system minus the 1work done by the system. 1Now, if this is 0-- so we know that this didn't change, 1because the temperature didn't change. 1So that means 0 is equal to Q minus W, or that 1Q is equal to W. 1So this is the work done by the system. 1You'll end up getting something in joules. 1And this is also equal to the heat put into the system. 1It's also equal to Q. 1So when you look at this, if we were to just draw this part 1of the curve-- let me redraw it just to make things neat. 1I want to give you a little bit of the convention of what 1people in the thermodynamics world tend to do. 1I'll make a neat drawing here. 1We started here, at state 1. 1And we moved along this rectangular hyperbola, which 1is an isotherm, to state 2. 1And now we calculated the area under this, which is the work 1done, which was this value right here. 1Let me write it there. 1It's nRT natural log of V2 over V1. 1This is V2. 1This is V1. 1This whole axis, remember, was the V-axis, volume axis. 1This axis here was the pressure axis. 1And the convention is that because we did work, but we 1were constant temperature, so our internal energy didn't 1change, we had to add energy to the system to make up for 1the work we did. 1So some heat must have been added to the system. 1And then what they do is they just put this little downward 1arrow and they write a Q right there. 1So some heat was put into the system during this isothermic 1process right there. 1And the value of that Q is equivalent to the work we did. 1We put the exact amount of heat into the system as the 1work that was performed. 1And because of that, our internal energy didn't change. 1Or you could say our temperature didn't change. 1Or you could go the other way. 1Because our temperature didn't change, these two things have 1to be equal. 1Anyway, I want to leave you there. 1Hopefully I gave you a little bit more of an intuition of 1how PV diagrams work, a little bit more intuition behind what 1isotherms and adiabatic mean. 1And the most important thing is, once we get a little bit 1mathy, this result can be useful for coming up with 1other interesting things about a lot of these thermal systems 1that we're dealing with. 1See you in the next video.",science_chemistry_thermodynamics-chemistry
" -  Each small square in the diagram has a side length of one centimeter. So, what is the area of the figure? So, we have this figure down here in blue, and we want to know its area. Area is the total space it covers. And, we're also told that each of these little squares has a side length of one centimeter. So, that means that each of these squares is one square centimeter. So, we can find the area by seeing how many square centimeters does this figure cover? One way would be to just try to draw the little square centimeters and count them. There's one square centimeter, there's two, and so on and keep counting them all the way through. Or, what we could do is we could look at this and try to break it into two shapes. So we can say down here, into two rectangles. Down here we have one rectangle, and up here we have a second rectangle. And then we can find the area of each rectangle and add it together to find the total area that the figure covers. Down here on the bottom, we have two rows of unit squares. And each of those has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So there's two rows of seven unit squares, or seven square centimeters, so the bottom rectangle is made up of 14 square centimeters. It covers 14 square centimeters. And the top rectangle, let's see we have one row, two, three, four, five rows. And each of those rows has one, two square centimeters, so we have five rows of two square centimeters, or 10. So, this top rectangle here that we have in blue covers 10 square centimeters, plus the bottom rectangle that we outlined in green covers 14 square centimeters, so in total, the entire figure covers 24 square centimeters. So, 24 square centimeters is our area, because area is how much space does it cover, and we figured out that it covered 24 square centimeters.",math_in-in-class-6-math-india-icse_in-in-6-perimeter-and-area-icse
" -  You're probably familiar with the general term factor. So if I were to say: What are the factors of 12, you could say: Well what are the whole numbers that I can multiply by another whole number to get 12? So for examples, you could say things like, well I could multiply one times 12 to get 12. So you could say that one is a factor of 12. You could even say that 12 is a factor of 12. You could say two times six is equal to 12, so you could say that two is a factor of 12 and that six is also a factor of 12. And of course three times four is also 12, so both three and four are factors of 12. So if you said well what are the factors of 12 and you've seen this before, well you could say: one, two, three, four, six, and 12, those are all factors of 12. And you could also phase it the other way around, so let me just give an example. So if I were to pick on three, I could say that three is a factor of 12. Or to phrase it slightly differently, I could say that 12 is divisible, 12 is divisible by three. Now what I wanna do in this video is extend this idea of being a factor or divisibility into the algebraic world. So for example, if I were to take 3xy. So this is a monomial with an integer coefficient. Three is an integer right over here. And if I were to multiply it with another monomial with an integer coefficient, I don't know, let's say times negative two X squared, Y to the third power, what is this going to be equal to? Well this would be equal to, if we multiply the coefficients, three times negative two is going to be negative six. X times X squared is X to the third power. And then Y times Y to the third is Y to the fourth power. And so what we could say is, if we wanted to say factors of negative six X to the third, Y to the fourth, we could say that 3xy is a factor of this just as an example; so let me write that down. We could write that 3xy is a factor of, is a factor of... of negative six X to the third power, Y to the fourth, or we could phrase that the other way around. We could say that negative six X to the third, Y to the fourth, is divisible by, is divisible by 3xy. So hopefully you're seeing the parallels. If I'm taking these two monomials with integer coefficients and I multiply 'em and I get this other, in this case, this other monomial, I could say that either one of these and there's actually other factors of this, but I could say either one of these is a factor of this monomial, or we could say that negative six X to the third, Y to the four is divisible by one of its factors. And we could even extend this to binomials or polynomials. For example, if I were to take, if I were to take, let me scroll down a little bit, whoops, if I were to take, let me say X plus three and I wanted to multiply it times X plus seven, we know that this is going to be equal to, if I were to write it as a trinomial, it's gonna be X times X, so X squared, and then it's gonna be three X plus seven X, so plus 10x; and if any of this looks familiar, we have a lot of videos where we go in detail of multiplying binomials like this. And then three times seven is 21. Plus 21. So because I multiplied these two, in this case binomials, or we could consider themselves to be polynomials, polynomials or binomials with integer coefficients. Notice the coefficients here, they're one, one. The constants here, they're all integers. Because I'm dealing with all integers here, we could say that either one of these binomials is a factor of this trinomial, or we could say this trinomial is divisible by either one of these. So let me write that down. So I could say, I'll just pick on X plus seven. We could say that X plus seven is a factor, is a factor of X squared plus 10x plus 21; or we could say that X squared plus 10x plus 21 is divisible by, is divisible by I could say X plus three or I could say X plus seven is divisible by, X plus seven. And the key is, is that both of these binomials, or even if we were dealing with polynomials, we are dealing with things that have integer, we're dealing with things that have integer coefficients.",math_algebra-home_alg-polynomials
" -  We are told that researchers suspect that myopia, or nearsightedness, is becoming more common over time. A study from the year 2000 showed 132 cases of myopia in 400 randomly selected people. A separate study from 2015 showed 228 cases in 600 randomly selected people. So what we're going to do in this video is do a hypothesis test to see if we have evidence to suggest the researcher suspicion that myopia is becoming more common over time. If at any point you are inspired, I encourage you to pause the video and try to work through things on your own, but here I go. I'm going to do it with you. So let's just start off by setting our null and alternative hypothesis. So remember, our null hypothesis, this would be that the known news here. So that would be that contrary to their suspicions, that myopia is not becoming more common. And so the way that we're measuring more common over time is we could look at the proportion of folks who have myopia in 2015 and compare that to the proportion in 2000. So our null hypothesis is that there's no difference. Is that the true proportion of folks who have myopia in 2015 is equal to the proportion of folks who have myopia in 2000. And then our alternative hypothesis, remember, they are, they suspect it's becoming more common over time. So that would be a situation where our true proportion in 2015 is greater than the true proportion in 2000. In this scenario, myopia would be becoming more common over time because 2015 happens after 2000. So before we even go about testing our null hypothesis, seeing if we can reject or not, which would suggest our alternative, you have to look at your conditions for inference. And we've done this many times before. You have your random condition, and it looks like we meet that because in both of the samples we have 400 randomly selected people, randomly selected people. So that looks good. Then you have your normal condition. And to meet your normal condition, your number of successes and failures in each of the samples have to be at least 10. And we see that that is the case. We have 132 successes so to speak, not that it's a success for someone to have myopia, but the way this is being constructed that would be a success. And then 400 minus 132 failures. In each case, either of those numbers would be greater than 10. And same thing for the sample from 2015, so we're meeting both of those. And then the last condition that we always talk about, is the independence condition. And two ways to get there, either you are sampling with replacement or you feel good that your sample size is no more than 10 percent of the population. And I think it is safe to say that even this larger sample of 600, that there is more than 6,000 people out there. And so I think it's reasonable to say that we're meeting that independence condition. Even though they're not making it explicit here. But it's good to always think about this. Now the next thing you wanna do in a hypothesis test is set your significance level, your alpha. And I'll set my significance level to 0.05. So we're not going to assume the null hypothesis and say, well what is the probability of getting a difference between 2015 and 2000 that is at least as large as the one that we got. And in that probability is less than our significance level then we would reject our null hypothesis and that would suggest the alternative. If that probability is greater than our significance level, then we fail to reject the null hypothesis and we fail to have evidence for the researchers suspicion. So let's move ahead with that. So what we wanna do, let's come up with a Z value, or a Z score. So our Z is going to be equal to a sample proportion in 2015 minus our sample proportion in 2000. All of that over a standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the difference between the sample proportions in 2015 and 2000. Now, this is going to be, and I will say approximately equal to, we can calculate this numerator exactly, but this denominator we are going to estimate. So this numerator is going to be, let's see, in 2015, I'll use some different colors, 2015 we have 228 cases out of 600. So it's 228 out of 600. And then in 2000, we have 132 cases out of 400. So minus 132 over 400. And then all of that over the square root. And what we use in the denominator here, under the radical sign, is we use the combined proportion. Could write that as P hat sub C. And the reason why we use the combined proportion, we talked about this in previous videos, is remember, when we do a hypothesis test, we assume that our null hypothesis is true. And if our null hypothesis is true there's no difference between our proportions in 2015 and 2000. And so to get a better estimate of the true proportion, well we should just add up our samples. So our sample size would be 600 plus 400 and the number of cases of myopia would be 228 plus 132. Plus 132. Which would get us to, what is this, 360 over 1000 which is equal to 0.36. And there, and we can use that inside the expression when we're trying to estimate our standard deviation of this sampling distribution. So this is going to be 0.36 times one minus 0.36, which would be 0.64 over the sample size in 2015, which is 600, plus 0.36 times 0.64 over the sample size in 2000, which is equal to 400. And let's see, before I even get my calculator out, I think I can simplify this a little bit. 228 over 600, 228 divided by 6 is going to be equal to 38, so this would be 0.38. Let's see, 132 divided by four would be 33, so this would be 0.33. And so our entire numerator is going to be 0.05, 0.05. And so noW I can put this into my calculator and I will get 0.05 divided by the square root of, let's see, I'm gonna have 0.36 times 0.64 divided by 600 plus 0.36 times 0.64 divided by 400 is going to get me approximately 1.61. So this is going to be approximately 1.61. And so one way to think about it is, the difference that we got between our sample proportions, between 2015 and 2000 of 0.05, but that is 1.61 standard deviations above our mean of our sampling distribution, if we assume that the null hypothesis is true. And so from this, we can calculate our P value. Remember, our P value, our P value is equal to the probability that our Z score is at least that big, is greater than or equal to 1.61. And one way to think about it, if you look at the sample distribution, I really could just look at any normal distribution now since we normalized for a Z, so we're looking at 1.61 standard deviations above the mean. So Z is equal to 1.61. So we're thinking about this area right over here. That would be our P value. And to help us with that, we can get out a Z table. And we see this Z table gives us the cumulative area up to some Z score, and so we would just have to whatever this gives us, we would just have to do one minus that. So if we go to 1.61, we get 0.9463. So it would be one minus 0.9463. Is equal to one minus 0.9463, which is equal to, let's see, it's 0.0537. And notice, this P value is ever so slightly higher than our significance level. But this is why we wanna set our significance level ahead of time. We don't wanna get tempted to say oh, I'm so close, let me just raise my significance level a little bit more so that I can reject my null hypothesis and then I can have something that I can tell my friends about. No, that would not be good science. That would not be good statistics. We have to be disciplined. So here, because our P value, our P value is greater than our significance level, even though it's very, it's by a very small amount, we fail to reject our null hypothesis. And another way to think about it, in terms of the context 1of the question, we can say that there is not 1enough evidence to suggest that myopia 1becoming more common over time. 1Myopia becoming more common over time. 1And we're done.",math_ap-statistics_two-sample-inference
" What I want to do in this video is start with some point that's not on the plane, or maybe not necessarily on the plane. So let me draw a point right over here. And let's say the coordinates of that point are x 0 x sub 0, y sub 0, and z sub 0. Or it could be specified as a position vector. I could draw the position vector like this. So the position vector-- let me draw a better dotted lines. The position vector for this could be x0i plus y0j plus z0k. It specifies this coordinate right over here. What I want to do is find the distance between this point and the plane. And obviously, there could be a lot of distance. I could find the distance between this point and that point, and this point and this point, and this point this point. And when I say I want to find the distance, I want to find the minimum distance. And you're actually going to get the minimum distance when you go the perpendicular distance to the plane, or the normal distance to the plane. And we'll, hopefully, see that visually as we try to figure out how to calculate the distance. So the first thing we can do is, let's just construct a vector between this point that's off the plane and some point that's on the plane. And we already have a point from the last video that's on the plane, this x sub p, y sub p, z sub p. So let's construct a vector here. Let's construct this orange vector that starts on the plane, it's tail is on the plane, and it goes off the plane. I want to do that in orange. It goes off the plane to this vector, to this position x0 y0 z0. So how could we specify this vector, right over here? Well, that vector, let me call that vector, well, I'll just call that vector, what letters have I'm not used yet? Let me call that vector f. Vector f is just going to be this yellow position vector, minus this green position vector. So it's going to be, this x component is going to be the difference of the x-coordinates, it's y-coordinate is going the difference of the y-coordinate. S So it's going to be x0 minus x sub p. I subtracted the x-coordinates, i. Plus y0 minus ypj plus-- we'll go to the next line-- plus z0 minus zp minus zpk. So fair enough. That's just some vector that comes off of the plane and onto this point. But what we want to find out is this distance. We want to find out this distance in yellow, the distance that if I were take a normal off of the plane and go straight to the point, that's going to be the shortest distance. And actually, you can see it visually now. Because if look at-- we can actually form a right triangle here-- so this base of the right triangle is along the plane. This side is normal to the plane. So this is a right angle. And you can see, if I take any point, any other point on the plane, it will form a hypotenuse on a right triangle. And obviously the shortest side here, or the shortest way to get to the plane, is going to be this distance, right here, as opposed to the hypotenuse. This side will always be shorter than that side. So given that we know this vector here, how can we figure out this length here? How can we figure out this length here in blue? Well, we could figure out the magnitude of this vector. So the length of this side right here is going to be the magnitude of the vector, so it's going to be the magnitude of the vector f. That'll just give us this length. But we want this blue length. Well, we could think about it. If this was some angle-- I know the writing is getting small. If this was some angle theta, we could use some pretty straight up, pretty straightforward trigonometry. If the distance under question is d, you could say cosine of theta is equal to the adjacent side over the hypotenuse. Or is is equal to d-- d is the adjacent side-- is equal to d over the hypotenuse. Well, the hypotenuse is the magnitude of this vector. It's the magnitude of the vector f. Or we could say the magnitude of the vector f times the cosine of theta-- I'm just multiplying both sides times the magnitude of vector x-- f is equal to d. But still you might say, OK, well Sal, we know what f is. We can figure that out. We can figure out its magnitude. But we don't know what theta is. How do we figure out what theta? And to do that, let's just think about it a little bit. This angle, this angle of theta, is the same angle. So this distance here isn't necessarily the same as the length of the normal vector. But it's definitely going in the same direction. So this angle here, is really the same thing as the angle between this vector and the normal vector. And so you might remember from earlier linear algebra, when we talk about the dot product of two vectors, it involves something with the cosine of the angle between them. And to make that fresh in your mind, let's multiply and divide both sides. Let me multiply and divide the left side of this equation by the magnitude of the normal vector. So I'm obviously not changing its value. I'm multiplying and dividing by the same number. So I'm going to multiply by the magnitude of the normal vector. And I'm going to divide by the magnitude of the normal vector. So I'm just essentially multiplying by 1. So I have not changed this. But when you do it in this, it might ring a bell. This expression up here, this expression right here, is the dot product of the normal vector and this vector right here, f. So this right here is the dot product. This is n dot f, up there. It's equal to the product of their magnitudes times the cosine of the angle between them. So the distance, that shortest distance we care about, is a dot product between this vector, the normal vector, divided by the magnitude of the normal vector. So let's do that. Let's take the dot product between the normal and this. And we already figured out, in the last video, the normal vector, if you have the equation of a plane, the normal vector is literally, its components are just the coefficients on the x, y, and z terms. So this is a normal vector right over here. So let's literally take the dot product. So n dot f is going to be equal to A times x0 minus xp. I'll do that in pink. So it'll be Ax0 minus Axp. And then plus B times the y component here. So plus By0. I'm just distributing the B, minus Byp. And then plus-- I'll do another color here, that's too close of a color-- plus C times the z component. So plus Cz0 minus Czp. And all of that over the magnitude of the normal vector. So what's the magnitude of the normal vector going to be? It's just the square root of the normal vector dotted with itself. So it's just each of these guys squared added to themself, and you're taking the square root. So it's the square root-- maybe I can do a nicer looking radical sign than that-- of A squared plus B squared plus C squared. Now, what is this up here simplified to? Let me just rewrite this. So this is the distance in question. This right here is equal to the distance. But let's see if we can simplify it. So first, we can take all of the terms with the x0. These involve the point that sits off the plane. Remember, x0, y0, z0 sat off the plane. So this is Ax0 plus By0 plus Cz0. And then what are these terms equal to? What are these terms? Negative Axp minus Byp minus Czp? Well, if you remember here, D in the equation of in the equation of a plane, D, when we started in the last video when we tried to figure out what the normal to a plane is, D is-- if this point xp sits on the plane-- D is Axp plus Byp plus Czp. Or another way you could say it is, negative D would be negative A-- and it's just the difference between lowercase and uppercase here, right? We're saying that lowercase is the same as this uppercase A. So it's negative Axp minus Byp minus Czp. I'm just using what we got from the last video. This is what D is so negative D will be this business. And that's exactly what we have over here. We have negative Axp negative Byp negative Czp. So all of this term, this term, and this term simplifies to a minus D. And remember, this negative capital D, this is the D from the equation of the plane, not the distance d. So this is the numerator of our distance. And then the denominator of our distance is just the square root of A squared plus B squared plus C squared. And we're done. This tells us the distance between any point and a plane. And this is a pretty intuitive formula here. Because all we're doing, if I give you-- let me give you an example. Let's say I have the plane. 1If I have the plane 1x minus 2y plus 3z is equal to 5. 1So that's some plane. 1And let me pick some point that's not on the plane. 1So let's say I have the point, I don't know, let me say I have 1the 2, 2, 3. 1And let me make sure it's not on the plane. 1So it's 2 minus 6 is negative-- yeah, so this won't. 1Let me just pick a random 1. 1So this definitely is not on the plane, 1because we have 2 minus 6 plus 3. 1That gives us negative 1, which is not 5. 1So this is definitely not on the plane. 1We can find the distance between this point and the plane 1using the formula we just derived. 1We literally just evaluate at-- so this will just be 1 times 2. 1Let me use that same color. 11 times 2 minus 2 times-- I'm going 1to fill it in-- plus 3 times something, minus 5. 1All of that over, and I haven't put these guys in. 1Let me do that right now. 1So 1 times 2 minus 2 times 3 plus 3 times 1. 1This 1 minus 5, you're kind of bringing it over 1to the left hand side. 1All of that over the square root of 1 1squared, which is 1, plus negative 2 1squared, which is 4, plus 3 squared, which is 9. 1So it's going to be equal to, let's see, this is 2 minus 6, 1or negative 6. 1And then you have plus 3. 1And then minus 5. 1So this is what? 1This is 5. 12 plus 3 is 5 minus 5. 1So those cancel out. 1So this is negative 6. 1So it's equal to negative 6 over the square root of 5 1plus 9 is 14. 1Over the square root of 14. 1And you're done. 1So hopefully, you find that useful. 1And hopefully, we can apply this in the other example problems.",math_linear-algebra_vectors-and-spaces
"  We need to add 7.056 to 605.7 to 5.67. Now when you're adding any number, you always want to make sure you line up numbers in the same place. And especially when you're dealing with decimals, the easiest way to do that is to just line up the decimals. So let's do that. So the first number right here is 7.056. This second number right here is 605.7. And then this last number is 5.67. So now we have everything lined up. Everything that's in the ones place is below or above everything else in the ones place. Everything in the tenths place is below or above everything else in the tenths place, and so on and so forth. So we can add. So let's add it.  So you want to start off in the smallest place. So you start off here. This is the tenths, hundredths, thousandths place. This is literally 6 thousandths, and you want to add it to the other thousandths. There aren't any other thousandths. So you can view it two ways. You can just bring in this 6 down, or you could view this 605.7 as the same thing as 605.700. You can add as many zeroes to the right of this decimal, to the right of the 7, as you want, since we're sitting on the right side of the decimal, without changing its value. You can also do it here. This 5.67, you can write it as 5.670. When you write it like this, and you have 6 plus 0 plus 0 is 6. And you keep going. 5 plus 0 plus 7 is 12. You write the 2 in the hundredths place, and carry the 1. 1 plus 0 plus 7 is 8, plus 6 is 14. Write the 4, regroup the 1 into the ones place. 1 plus 7 is 8. 8 plus 5 is 13. 13 plus 5 is 18. This is 18. Carry or regroup the 1. 1 plus 0 is just 1. And then finally. You have the 6 in the hundreds place. Nothing gets added to it, so you can just bring down that 6 and it's right there. And you don't want to forget the decimal. And so when you add the numbers you get 618.426, or 618 and 426 thousandths. And we're done. ",math_6th-engage-ny_engage-6th-module-2
" I think you've probably heard the word divide before, where someone tells you to divide something up. Divide the money between you and your brother or between you and your buddy. And it essentially means to cut up something. So let me write down the word divide. Let's say that I have 4 quarters. Do my best to draw the quarters. If I have 4 quarters just like that. That's my rendition of George Washington on the quarters. And let's say there's two of us and we're going to divide the quarters between us. So this is me right here. Let me try my best to draw me. So that's me right there. Let's see, I have a lot of hair. And then this is you right there. Do my best. So you're bald. You have side burns. Maybe you have a little bit of a beard. I want to get too focused on the drawing. So that's you, that's me, and we're going to divide these 4 quarters between the 2 of us. So notice, we have 4 quarters and we're going to divide between the 2 of us. There are 2 of us. And I want to stress the number 2. So we're going to divide 4 quarters by 2. We're going to divide it between the 2 of us. And you've probably done something like this. What happens? Well, each of us are going to get 2 quarters. So let me divide it. We're going to divide it into 2. Essentially what I did do is I take the 4 quarters and I divide it into 2 equal groups. And that's what division is. We cut up this group of quarters into 2 equal groups. So when you divide 4 quarters into 2 groups, so this was 4 quarters right there. And you want to divide it into 2 groups. This is group 1. Group 1 right here. And this is group 2 right here. How many numbers are in each group? Or how many quarters are in each group? Well, in each group I have 1, 2 quarters. Let me use a brighter color. I have 1, 2 quarters in each group. 1 quarter and 2 quarters in each group. So to write this out mathematically, I think this is something that you've done, probably as long as you've been splitting money between you and your siblings and your buddies. Actually, let me scroll over a little bit, so you can see my entire picture. How do we write this mathematically? We can write that 4 divided by-- so this 4. Let me use the right colors. So this 4, which is this 4, divided by the 2 groups, these are the 2 groups: group 1 and this is group 2 right here. So divided into 2 groups or into 2 collections. 4 divided by 2 is equal to-- when you divide 4 into 2 groups, each group is going to have 2 quarters in it. It's going to be equal to 2. And I just wanted to use this example because I want to show you that division is something that you've been using all along. And another important, I guess, takeaway or thing to realize about this, is on some level this is the opposite of multiplication. If I said that I had 2 groups of 2 quarters I would multiply the 2 groups times the 2 quarters each and I would say I would then have 4 quarters. So on some level these are saying the same thing. But just to make it a little bit more concrete in our head, let's do a couple of more examples. Let's do a bunch of more examples. So let's write down, what is 6 divided by-- I'm trying to keep it nice and color coded. 6 divided by 3, what is that equal to? Let's just draw 6 objects. They can be anything. Let's say I have 6 bell peppers. I won't take too much trouble to draw them. Well, that's not what a bell pepper looks like, but you get the idea. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And I'm going to divide it by 3. And one way that we can think about that is that means I want to divide my 6 bell peppers into 3 equal groups of bell peppers. You could kind of think of it if 3 people are going to share these bell peppers, how many do each of them get? So let's divide it into 3 groups. So that's our 6 bell peppers. I'm going to divide it into 3 groups. So the best way to divide it into 3 groups is I can have 1 group right there, 2 groups, or the second group right there, and then, the third group. And then each group will have exactly how many bell peppers? They'll have 1, 2. 1, 2. 1, 2 bell peppers. So 6 divided by 3 is equal to 2. So the best way or one way to think about it is that you divided the 6 into 3 groups. Now you could view that a slightly different way, although it's not completely different, but it's a good way to think about it. You could also think of it as 6 divided by 3. And once again, let's say I have raspberries now-- easier to draw. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And here, instead of dividing it into 3 groups like we did here. This was 1 group, 2 group, 3 groups. Instead of dividing into 3 groups, what I want to do is say well, if I'm dividing 6 divided by 3, I want to divide it into groups of 3. Not into 3 groups. I want to divide it into groups of 3. So how many groups of 3 am I going to have? Well, let me draw some groups of 3. So that is one group of 3. And that is two groups of 3. So if I take 6 things and I divide them into groups of 3, I will end up with 1, 2 groups. So that's another way to think about division. And this is an interesting thing. When you think about these two relations, you'll see a relationship between 6 divided by 3 and 6 divided by 3. Let me do that right here. What is 6 divided by 2 when you think of it in this context right here? 6 divided by 2, when you do it like that-- let me draw 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. When we think about 6 divided by 2 in terms of dividing it into 2 groups, what we can end up is we could have 1 group like this and then 1 group like this, and each group will have 3 elements. It'll have 3 things in it. So 6 divided by 2 is 3. Or you could think of it the other way. You could say that 6 divided by 2 is-- you're taking 6 objects: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And your dividing it into groups of 2 where each group has 2 elements. And that on some level is an easier thing to do. If each group has 2 elements, well, that's the 1 right there. They don't even have to be nicely ordered. This could be one group right there and that could be the other group right there. I don't have to draw them all stacked up. These are just groups of 2. But how many groups do I have? I have 1, 2, 3. I have 3 groups. But notice something, it's no coincidence that 6 divided by 3 is 2 and 6 divided by 2 is 3. Let me write that down. We get 6 divided by 3 is equal to 2 and 6 divided by 2 is equal to 3. And the reason why you see this relation where you can kind of swap this 2 and this 3 is because 2 times 3 is equal to 6. Let's say I have 2 groups of 3. Let me draw 2 groups of 3. So that's 1 group of 3 and then here's another group of 3. So 2 groups of 3 is equal to 6. 2 times 3 is equal to 6. Or you could think of it the other way if I have 3 groups of 2. So that's 1 group of 2 right there. I have another group of 2 right there. And then I have a 3 group of 2 right there. What is that equal to? 3 groups of 2-- 3 times 2. That's also equal to 6. So 2 times 3 is equal to 6. 3 times 2 is equal to 6. We saw this in the multiplication video that the order doesn't matter. But that's the reason why if you want to divide it, if you want to go the other way-- if you have 6 things and you want to divide it into groups of 2, you get 3. If you have 6 and you want to divide into groups of 3, you get 2. Let's do a couple of more problems. I think it'll really make sense about what division is all about. Let's do an interesting one. Let's do 9 divided by 4. So if we think about 9 divided by 4, let me draw 9 objects. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Now when you divide by 4, for this problem, I'm thinking about dividing it into groups of 4. So if I want to divide it into groups of 4, let me try doing that. 1So here is one group of 4. 1I just picked any of them right like that. 1That's one group of 4. 1Then here's another group of 4 right there. 1And then I have this left over thing. 1Maybe we could call it a remainder, where I can't put 1this one into a group of 4. 1When I'm dividing by 4 I can only cut up the 19 into groups of 4. 1So the answer here, and this is a new concept for you maybe, 9 1divided by 4 is going to be 2 groups. 1I have one group here and another group here, and then 1I have a remainder of 1. 1I have 1 left over that I wasn't able to do with. 1Remainder-- that says remainder 1. 19 divided by 4 is 2 remainder 1. 1If I asked you what 12 divided by 4 is, so let me do 12. 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 1So let me write that down. 112 divided by 4. 1So I want to divide these 12 objects-- maybe 1they're apples or plums. 1And divide them into groups of 4. 1So let me see if I can do that. 1So this is one group of 4 just like that. 1This is another group of 4 just like that. 1And this is pretty straightforward. 1And then I have a third group of 4 just like that. 1And there's nothing left over like I had before. 1I can exactly divide 12 objects into 3 groups of 4. 11, 2, 3 groups of 4. 1So 12 divided by 4 is equal to 3. 1And we can do the exercise that we saw on the previous video. 1What is 12 divided by 3? 1Let me do a new color. 112 divided by 3. 1Now based on what we've learn so far we say, that should just 1be 4 because 3 times 4 is 12. 1But let's prove it to ourselves. 1So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 20, 11, 12. 1Let's divide it into groups of 3. 1And I'm going to make them a little strange looking just 1so you see that you don't always have to do it into 1nice, clean columns. 1So that's a group of 3 right there. 112 divided by 3. 1Let's see, here is another group of 3 just like that. 1And then, maybe I'll take this group of 3 like that. 1And I'll take this group of 3. 1There was obviously a much easier way of dividing it up 1then doing these weird l-shaped things, but I want to show 1you it doesn't matter. 1You're just dividing it into groups of 3. 1And how many groups do we have? 1We have one group. 1Then we have our second group right here. 1And then we have our third group right there. 1And then we have-- let me do it in a new color. 1And then we have our fourth group right there. 1So we have exactly 4 groups. 1And when I say there was an easier way to divide it, the 1easier way was obviously, maybe not obviously-- if I want to 1divide these into groups of 3 I could have just done 1, 12, 3, 4 groups of 3. 1Either of these I'm dividing the 12 objects 1into packets of 3. 1You can imagine them that way. 1Let's do another one that maybe has a remainder. 1Let's see. 1What is 14 divided by 5? 1So let's draw 14 objects. 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 14. 114 objects. 1And I'm going to divide it into groups of 5. 1Well, the easiest thing is there's one group right there, 1two groups right there. 1But then this last one, I only have 4 left, so I can't 1make another group of 5. 1So the answer here is I can make 2 groups of 5 and I'm 1going to have a remainder-- r for remainder-- of 4. 12 remainder 4. 1Now, once you get enough practice, you're not always 1going to be wanting to draw these circles and dividing 1them up like that. 1Although that would not be incorrect. 1So another way to think about this type of problem is to 1say, well, 14 divided by 5, how do I figure that out? 1Actually, another way of writing this and no 1harm in showing you. 1I could say 14 divided by 5 is the same thing as 15 divided 1by-- this sign right-- divided by 5. 1And what you do is you say, well, let's see. 1How many times does 5 go into 14? 1Well, let's see. 15 times and you kind of do multiplication 1tables in your head. 15 times 1 is equal to 5. 15 times 2 is equal to 10. 1So that's still less than 14, so 5 goes at least two times. 15 times 3 is equal to 15. 1Well that's bigger than 14, so I have to go back here. 1So 5 only goes two times. 1So it goes 2 times. 12 times 5 is 10. 1And then you subtract. 1You say 14 minus 10 is 4. 1And that's the same remainder as right here. 1Well, I could divide 5 into 14 exactly two times, which 1would get us 2 groups of 5. 1Which is essentially just 10. 1And we still have the 4 left over. 1Let me do a couple of more just to really make sure you get 1this stuff really, really, really, really well. 1Let me write it in that notation. 1Let's say I do 8 divided by 2. 1And I could also write this as 8-- so I want 1to know what that is. 1That's a question mark. 1I could also write this as 8 divided by 2. 1And the way I do either of these, I'll draw the circles in 1the second, but the way I do it without drawing the circles, I 1say, well, 2 times 1 is equal to 2. 1So that definitely goes into 8, but maybe I can think of a 1larger number that goes into-- that when I multiply it 1by 2 still goes into 8. 12 times 2 is equal to 4. 1That's still less than 8. 1So 2 times 3 is equal to 6. 1Still less than 8. 12 times-- oh, something weird happened to my pen. 12 times 4 is exactly equal to 8. 1So 2 goes into 8 four times. 1So I could say 2 goes into 8 four times. 1Or 8 divided by 2 is equal to 4. 1We can even draw our circles. 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1I drew them messy on purpose. 1Let's divide them into groups of 2. 1I have one group of 2, two groups of 2, three groups 1of 2, four groups of 2. 1So if I have 8 objects, divide them into groups of 2, 1you have four groups. 1So 8 divided by 2 is 4. 1Hopefully you found that helpful.",math_arithmetic-home_multiply-divide
" For us modern humans with our easy access to the local supermarket it's easy to forget that throughout human history and even today the amount of humans or human population has been limited by our ability to get calories or get human consumable food from the land, so what I want to do in this video is give us a little bit of a framework for thinking about how humans have been gathering calories from the land and how that's placed an upper limit on the number of humans that can live in any given area, or the population density of humans. So right over here you have some gentlemen looking for food, they are hunter-gatherers. I'll say HG for short, and the H part, the hunter part that they might actually find some animals. I think these guys are trying right over here are trying to trap some rabbits and the gathering part, they're just literally looking for food maybe they find fruit of some sort, or some nuts or maybe some roots that are edible by humans so literally just walk around either try to kill things or find things they can consume. So I'll call this right over here stage one. So this is hunter-gatherers, this is what most humans have done through most of human history. And just to give us a little bit of a framework for how much they could get from the land, I looked in some of the best sense of studying HG populations in land like this maybe they can get about 200 calories. I'll make this a whole column, this whole column is the amount that they can get in terms of calories per square kilometre per day. Now it's obviously going to be hugely dependent on the number of animals that live there, the type of land that's there, if they're next to a stream where maybe fish are just jumping out of the stream this number would be much higher, if they were in some type of desert this number would be much lower. But this is actually fairly in line with some of the studies of HG cultures. Now if this the number of calories that they can get from each square kilometre per day, how many humans can live in a square kilometre per day? What is the density of humans? Well, to figure that out we have know on average how many calories does a human need to survive, and for the sake of this video I'm going to make the assumption that a human being needs 2,000 calories per day to survive in a non-malnourished state. And obviously it's hugely dependent on how activ this person is or how large they are. And one other note: this whole I will be using Calories with the capital C. The Calories with the capital C are the calories that people are used to refering to when you go to the gym and you run on the treadmill and it says how many calories you've burnt or you look at the back of your candy bar and it says 200 calories. These are tha calories I'm talking about. They're slightly different notion than the calories that you encounter in your chemistry class. Those calories are calories with a lower case c. And just so that you can be optimally confused it turns out that 1 Calory with an upper case C is equal to 1,000 calories with a lower case c. And the lower case c calories are the amount of energy needed to heat 1 gramme of water 1°C. So this is what you see in your chemistry class but this is not what we are going to be talking about in this video. We're talking about the capital C Calories that dietitians are always talking about. So with this assumption that the average human eats 2000 Calories a day to not get malnourished, and obviously man would eat more, women would eat less, children would eat even less, but with this assumption, what is the density of humans that could be supported by this culture right over here? Well, 200 Calories is 1 tenth of the average daily human requirement if you believe this assumption. The the population density, humans per square kilometre you can always support 1 tenth of a human with this Calory output! So you can only support 0.1 of a human per a square kilometre. So 1 human would actually need 10 square kilometres to hunt from and gather from in order to support just themselves! They would need maybe 30 or 40 square kilometres to support an entire family, so they could wander around and kill the animals and find whatever they need to find on that land. Now let's go to kind of you can view as maybe the next stage although it's now always the case that herding is going to be more productive than HG, especially with that case with the fish jumping out of the water, but let's go to the scenario right over here. So this is, we can call this a pastoral life-style. So this is 2, I'll call it pastoral. And over here is the realisation that, look, you have all of this vegetation that maybe humans can't consume but there are other animals that can consume this vegetation and they can turn those calories into calories that can be consumed by humans and, namely, the calories are themselves! So this gentleman right over here after he gets these sheep to be nice and fat, he can either eat the sheep or he can drink their milk, so one way to think about this cattle or these sheep right over here by herding them and letting them eat this grass he is turning non-human-consumable calories into human-consumable calories. And for the sake of our thought experiment let's tell we got 10 time increase in the human-consumable calories per square kilometre. So now instead of 200 we're up to 2,000. And so instead of one human per square kilometre per day to support one human ... oh sorry, instead of 0.1 we can now support 1 human. So in that 10 square kilometres we can now support 10 people, in 100 square kilometres we can now support 100 people. Now the next stage - and I'm skipping a bunch of stages because we have things like subsistence agriculture and various forms that are not going to be equally productive, it depends what the land is like, it depends what tools at disposal, but the next stage that I'll just kind of jump to we can call traditional agriculture. So this right over here, let's call that traditional agriculture. And that's this one over here as well, so both of these I'm going to call traditional agriculture. For the purposes of this video the difference between traditional agriculture and modern agriculture - in traditional agriculture you didn't have mechanisation, so you had very primitive mechanisation, you definitely didn't have fossil fuel based engines, you didn't have modern pesticides, you didn't have modern genetically engineered crops, but you have some of the basic science of breeding crop and irrigating and using animals as tools. So in this stage right over here, and once again, it completely depends on where you are on the planet, how fertile the land is, how good your tools are, what crops you are actually producing. Let's assume that we've got a hundredfold increasse in the productivity. And looking in some of the historical records it looks like, it's depending on once again where you are, that's not out of the realm of possibility. So you have a hundredfold increase, so insdead of 2,000 calories per square kilometre per day you can get 200,000 calories per square kilometre per day, and now you can support 100 humans per square kilometre - if you wanna to! So you might not have 100 humans, one on all of the land, you might not be able to farm from, or there are other limits on the population for whatever they might be, but the important thing is to think about this upper bound. In this traditional you are able to get type of productivity from your land and you are able to in theory support 100 people per 1 square kilometre, that means if all of a sudden you have 200 people living there, they maybe every once migrate to this land because it seems as specially fertile or there are really small farmers living there, then all of a sudden not everyone is going to get 2,000 calories a day, some people might get malnourished, other people might actually starve. There is this upper bound on the actual number of people that can be there based on how productive the land actually is. Now let's move over to modern agriculture and we want to talk a little bit about what exactly is modern agriculture. You have machines like this combine over here that does a lot of the human labour. One human can... I'll talk about the different dimensions because there are actually two dimensions here: how much calories can you get from the land, and how much energy and labour can one human input into the land using tools at their disposal. So in this case cattle, these oxen pulling this plough, or in this case this combine that's fueled by fossil fuels. But in modern agriculture, because all of the things, you have these amazing tools, you have genetically engineered crops, you have modern pesticides and ... not everyone is a fan of all of these things, but they have hugely increased our productivity. So you have modern agriculture. Let's say that you have another factor of 10 from traditional agriculture. so now you can get 2,000,000 calories per square kilometre per day, or you can support 1,000 humans per square kilometre. So once again this right over here is an upper bound. And just to give a sense, I picked these numbers just so that nubmers would be clear I looked in some historical records, these are completely out of line with what it looks like human have been able to do in the past, but to give you a sense of what human populatin densities look like right now and why this upper bound seems to be right about correct, in a place like the U.S. the population density is 30 people per square kilometre, 1in a more dense country or a significantly more dense country like India 1the population density is 300 humans per square kilometre. 1And in the most population dense country in the world, 1which is where I come from, or actually I was born in New Orleans, 1but where some of my ancestors came from, 1which is Bangladesh, so there's a lot of people like me, I guess, 1Bangladesh has population density of 900 humans per square kilometre! 1To some degree this is a testament to the fertility of the land and whatever else, 1but this is pretty near the limits depending on 1agricultural productivity in what now on the land 1of modern technology, so it really makes you think 1if you don't get population under control, 1you might end up with some of these kind of hitting the wall type of scenarios. 1And so the last thing I want you to think about 1and this is why I reffered to a little bit more, 1is just think about those two dimensions 1because sometimes it get a little bit muddled. 1One is the kind of the productivity of land 1and at the other there is productivity of labour. 1So right over here in HG, they're not getting many calories from their land 1so they're right over there, and the humans have to do all the labour, 1they don't have animals helping them in any way, 1they definitely don't have robots or any types of engines helping them in any way, 1and so there have to spend a lot of human time and a lot of human labour 1doing the work, getting that productivity from the land. 1But as progress with things that aid humans, 1so for example if you all of a sudden have cattle helping you 1or you have other tools that help you, 1you get more human productivity, so less and less of human labour 1has to be used to get that productivity from the land 1so maybe other humans can do other things 1like paint pictures or become blacksmiths or whatever, 1and in this direction you get higher productivity per unit of land 1and so that comes from moving from HG to a pastoral life-style 1to traditional farming with irrigation, to modern farming. 1And so in this graph kind of tools for the individuals move us up, 1getting productivity from the land moves us right, 1modern argriculture gets us right over here. 1So we're getting mach more calories per unit land 1and we're getting much more calories per unit labour. 1So you need much smaller percentage of the human population 1actually involved in the farming. 1Anyway, I let you go there, hopefuly that gives you at least an undesrtanding 1of that food doesn't just come from nowhere, 1it really is a rate-limiting factor on humanity's population.",science_cosmology-and-astronomy_life-earth-universe
" -  The distribution of resting pulse rates of all students at Santa Maria High School was approximately normal with mean of 80 beats per minute and standard deviation of nine beats per minute. The school nurse plans to provide additional screening to students whose resting pulse rates are in the top 30% of the students who were tested. What is the minimum resting pulse rate at that school for students who will receive additional screening? Round to the nearest whole number. If you feel like you know how to tackle this, I encourage you to pause this video and try to work it out. All right, now let's work this out together. They're telling us that the distribution of resting pulse rates are approximately normal. So we could use a normal distribution. And they tell us several things about this normal distribution. They tell us that the mean is 80 beats per minute. So that is the mean right over there. And they tell us that the standard deviation is nine beats per minute. So on this normal distribution, we have one standard deviation above the mean, two standard deviations above the mean, so this distance right over here is nine. So this would be 89. This one right over here would be 98. And you could also go standard deviations below the mean, this right over here would be 71, this would be 62, but what we're concerned about is the top 30% because that is who is going to be tested. So there's gonna be some value here, some threshold. Let's say it is right over here, that if you are at that score, you have reached the minimum threshold to get an additional screening. You are in the top 30%. So that means that this area right over here is going to be 30% or 0.3. So what we can do, we can use a z-table to say for what z-score is 70% of the distribution less than that. And then we can take that z-score and use the mean and the standard deviation to come up with an actual value. In previous examples, we started with the z-score and were looking for the percentage. This time we're looking for the percentage. We want it to be at least 70% and then come up with the corresponding z-score. So let's see, immediately when we look at this, and we are to the right of the mean, and so we're gonna have a positive z-score. So we're starting at 50% here. We definitely want to get to the 67%, 68, 69, we're getting close and on our table this is the lowest z-score that gets us across that 70% threshold. It's at 0.7019. So it definitely crosses the threshold. And so that is a z-score of 0.53. 0.52 is too little. So we need a z-score of 0.53. Let's write that down. 0.53, right over there, and we just now have to figure out what value gives us a z-score of 0.53. Well, this just means 0.53 standard deviations above the mean. So to get the value, we would take our mean and we would add 0.53 standard deviation. So 0.53 times nine. And this will get us 0.53 times nine is equal to 4.77 plus 80 is equal to 84.77. 84.77 and they want us to round to the nearest whole number. So we will just round to 85 beats per minute. So that's the threshold. If you have that resting heartbeat, then the school nurse is going to give you some additional screening.

" -  In a previous video, we introduced ourselves to the idea of bonds and the idea of ionic bonds, where one atom essentially is able to take electrons from another atom. But then because one becomes positively charged and the other becomes negatively charged, they get attracted to each other. Now we're going to go to the other end of the bonding spectrum, where instead of stealing electrons from each other, we're going to share them. Let's say we're dealing with two oxygen atoms. So let me draw one oxygen here. A neutral oxygen has eight electrons total, but six of them are in its outer shell. So it has one, two, three, four, five, six valence electrons. And the way that I arrange them is I pair them up last. So you have these two valence electrons that are not paired with another electron. And now let me draw another oxygen, and I'm going do it with a different color, so we can keep track of the electrons. So another oxygen right over there, also has six valence electrons, one, two, three, four, five, six valence electrons. Now this oxygen on the left, in order to become more stable, it would love to somehow gain or maybe share two more electrons. And of course, this oxygen on the right, it's still oxygen. It also would love to gain or share two more valence electrons. So how could it do it? Well, what if the oxygen on the left shared this electron and this electron with the oxygen on the right, and the oxygen on the right shared this electron and this electron with the oxygen on the left? Well, if they did that, you would have something that looks like this. You have your oxygen on the left. You have the oxygen on the right. And the way we show two electrons that are being shared, let's say these two electrons are being shared, is just a line like this. This shows that there are two electrons that are being shared by these two oxygens. And let's say that these two electrons are also being shared. You would do that with a line like this. And then we could draw the remainder of the valence electrons. This oxygen on the left had, outside of the electrons that are being shared, it had four more valence electrons. And then the oxygen on the right had four more valence electrons, one, two, three, four. Now what's interesting here is the shared electrons, these are going to cause these oxygens to stick together. If they don't stick together, these electrons aren't going to be shared. So what we have formed here is known as a covalent bond, covalent bond. And what's interesting is it allows both of these oxygens in some ways to be more stable. From the left oxygen's point of view, it had six valence electrons, but now it's able to share two more. Remember, each of these bonds, each of these lines represent two electrons. So this oxygen could say, hey, I get to have one, two, three, four, six, eight electrons that I'm dealing with, and the same thing is going to be true of this oxygen on the right. Now there are some covalent bonds that are between not-so-equals. So for example, if we're talking about water and if we're talking about how oxygen bonds with hydrogen. So if we have oxygen right over here, once again, I can draw its six valence electrons, one, two, three, four, five, and let me just draw the sixth one right over there. And if I have hydrogen, hydrogen has one valence electron. So let's say that's a hydrogen right over there with one valence electron, maybe another hydrogen right over there with one valence electron. Oxygen and hydrogen form covalent bonds. In fact, that is how water is formed. And so what would that look like? Well, it would look like this. You have oxygen right over here. You have these two pairs of electrons that I keep drawing. And then this electron right over here could be shared with the hydrogen, and that hydrogen's electron could be shared with the oxygen. So that forms a covalent bond with this hydrogen. And then this electron from the oxygen can be shared with the hydrogen, and that electron from the hydrogen can be shared with the oxygen. And so that would form a covalent bond with that other hydrogen. And now here, once again, oxygen can kinda pretend like it has eight valence electrons, two, four, six, eight. And the hydrogens can kind of pretend that it has two valence electrons. But the one difference here is that oxygen is a lot more electronegative than hydrogen. It's to the right of hydrogen. It's in this top-right corner, outside of, other than the noble gases, that really like to hog electrons. So what do you think is going to happen here? Well, the electrons in each of these covalent bonds are going to hang out around the oxygen more often than around the hydrogen. So if the electrons spend more time around the oxygen, you're going to have, in general, more negative charge around the oxygen. And so you're going to have a partial negative charge on the oxygen end of the water molecule, and then you're going to have partial positive charges on the hydrogen ends of the molecules. And in case you're curious, that little symbol I'm using for partial, that's the lowercase Greek letter delta, which is just the convention in chemistry. And so this type of covalent bond, because there is some polarity, one side has more charge than the other, this is known as a polar covalent bond, polar covalent bond.",science_ap-biology_chemistry-of-life
" We're on problem 51. And they say, a diagram from a proof of the Pythagorean theorem is pictured below. And they they say, which statement would not be used in the proof of the Pythagorean theorem? So since they have drawn this diagram out, I think we might as well just kind of do the proof and then we can look at their choices and see which ones kind of match up to what we did. Hopefully, they do it the same way. And this is a pretty neat proof of the Pythagorean theorem. I don't think I've done it yet. So I might as well do it now. Well, let's figure out what the area of this large square is right. Well there's two ways to think about it you could just say, OK, this is a square. That's a, that's b. Well this is going to be b as well. This is going to be a as well. So the area of the square is going to be the length of one of its sides squared. So we could say the whole square's area is a plus b squared. And that's equal to a squared plus 2ab plus b squared. Fair enough. Now we can also say that the area of this larger square, and it's a bit of an optical illusion, it looks like it's tilted to the left because of the way it's drawn. But anyway, that the area of this larger square is also the area of these four triangles plus the area of this smaller square. So this, the area of the larger square, which we figured out just by taking one side of it and squaring it, that should be equal to the area of the four smaller triangles. So there's four of them. And what's the area of each of them. Let's see, let's just pick this one. 1/2 base times height. So it's 1/2 times a times b. So 1/2 ab is one of these and I multiply by 4 to get all four of these triangles. And then we want to add the area of this inside square. And that's just going to be c squared. So plus c squared. Let's see if we can simplify this. So you get a squared plus 2ab plus b squared is equal to 4 times 1/2 is 2ab plus c squared. Well, we could subtract 2ab from both sides of this equation. The top and the bottom of this equation the way I've written it. But if we do that, subtract 2ab from there, subtract 2ab from there, and you're left with a squared plus b squared is equal to c squared, which is the Pythagorean theorem. And we've proved it. So let's see which of their choices matches what we did. OK, which statement would not be used in the proof of the Pythagorean theorem. The area of a triangle equals 1/2 ab. We used that. The four right triangles are congruent. No, we used that. The area of the inner square is equal to half of the area of the larger square. We didn't use that. I think this is the one that would not be used in the proof. Choice D, the area of the larger square is equal to the sum of the squares of the smaller square and the four congruent triangles. No, that that was the crux of the proof. So we definitely used that. So C is our answer. That's the statement that would not be used in the proof. I'm learning to copy and paste ahead of time. So I don't waste your time. All right, a right triangle's hypotenuse has length 5. If one leg has length 2, what is the length of the other leg? Pythagorean theorem, x squared plus 2 squared is equal to 5 squared, because 5 is the hypotenuse. x squared plus 4 is equal to 25. Subtract 4 from both sides. x squared is equal to 21. So x is equal to the square root of 21. So choice B. Next question. A new pipeline is being constructed to reroute oil flow around the exterior of a national wildlife preserve. I guess that's the national wildlife preserve. The plan showing the old pipeline and the new route is shown below. OK, how many extra miles will the oil flow once the new route is establised. So the new route is going to be 60 miles plus 32 miles. So the new route is 92 miles. So what was the old route? Well the old route was the hypotenuse of this triangle. So we could say, let's call that x. 60 squared plus 32 squared is equal to x squared. Because that's the hypotenuse. And these numbers, that's a bit of a pain to deal with. Maybe if I can factor out something here I can make it more interesting. So I don't have to multiply out 60 squared and 32 squared and all of the rest. Well, let me see. Both of those are divisible by 4. So then I would have 15 and 8. Yeah, that still doesn't make it that useful. So I'll just multiply them out. So this is 3600. At 32 squared, let's see, 32 times 32. 2 times 32 is 64. 3 times 2 is 6. 3 times 3 is 9. So it's 1024. Plus 1024 is equal to x squared. So let me just switch both sides. x squared is equal to 3600 plus 1024 is 4624. Let me see if I can get an approximate. So x is going to be the square root of this thing right here. So let's see if I can get a handle at least on the magnitude of where this would be. So 20 times 20 is 400. So this is way too small. 60 times 60 is 3600. So 68 times 68, this looks right. Especially because 8 times 8 should end in a 4. Let me try that out. 68 times 68. 8 times 8 is 64. 8 times 6 is 48 plus 6 is 54. 6 times 8, 48. 6 times 6, 36 plus 4 is 40. 4624. So x is 68. Oh, I used 68, I shouldn't have. Because they don't want to know how long was the old pipeline. That's 68. It just happened to be one of the choices. That's just to make sure that you read the question properly. But they want to know how much longer is going to be the new pipeline. So the new one was 92. And the old one is 68. Good thing they had that number there so I could try it out. That was the square root of 4624. So how much longer is the new one? Well 92 minus 68 that's 24 miles. So choice A. Not choice B. B is how long the old pipeline was. We want to know how much longer the new route is. That was tricky. Well not tricky, but I kind of fell for it by forgetting what the question was about. Anyway, next question. Marcia is using a straightedge and compass to do the construction below. Interesting. Which best describes the construction Marcia is doing. So, I assume when they say construction she's drawing something. Let's see what it looks like. It looks she's taking her compass, she's probably putting one of the points here, she put one of the points there and then she kind of drew this arc. And then it looks like she put the point there and then she drew that arc. And then she put the point here and drew that arc. And then put the point there and drew that arc. And the end result, it seems like the reason why she picked this point here is it goes through this line L. So she's probably trying to find another point here, so that she can draw another line. Because they say she has a straightedge. A straightedge is to draw these lines. A compass is to draw these curves. So if she were to draw another line between these two points, it looks something like that, then she would have parallel lines. The reason why she would have parallel lines is because these would be corresponding angles and they would be congruent. And so if you have a transversal the corresponding angles are congruent, you're dealing with parallel lines. So my read of this question is that she's probably trying to draw a line that is parallel to L. A line through P parallel to line L. Yeah, that's what I think she's trying to do. All right, choice A. 55. Given angle A. So given this angle. 1What is the first step in constructing the angle 1bisector of angle A? 1OK, well actually I've never done this. 1But I can assume that if I have a compass. 1You know what a compass is, it has those two points. 1One of them is like a pivot point. 1It looks something like this. 1It looks like it has a little pivot point, and then on the 1other side you can stick your pencil. 1And you can adjust it up here. 1And the bottom line, you pivot around this and then you can 1draw circles of arbitrary radiuses. 1It seems like that's what they did here. 1So if I want to draw the angle bisector of a, just thinking 1about it, it seems I could put the pivot point here, and then 1I can put the pencil and I can draw this circle. 1And really, as long as I just find the two points that it 1intersects those two lines or those two rays, 1then I'll be fine. 1And I could have done it anywhere. 1I could have done it here. 1I could have done it out here. 1They just picked points B and C. 1And then from each of those points, you can 1put your pivot here. 1If you put your pivot here, and then you were to draw a 1circle around that, you would have gotten 1this one right here. 1And then if you were to put your pivot point right here, 1draw a circle, you would be able to draw that. 1And then where they interect, that would that would give you 1an indication of where the angle bisector is. 1And you could then draw that line to where they intersect. 1So let's see, they say what is the first step in constructing 1the angle bisector of angle a. 1So they say draw ray AD. 1Well that seems like that would be the last step. 1Then you're done. 1Draw AD, that is the angle biector. 1Draw a line segment connecting points B and C. 1No, that's useless. 1You don't need a line segment. 1I mean even what they have drawn, that's an arc. 1It's not a line. 1From points B and C, draw equal arcs that 1intersect at D. 1That was the second step. 1You have to have points B and C before you can draw those 1equal arcs. 1From point A, draw an arc that intersects the side of the 1angle at points B and C. 1Yeah, that's what we said. 1That was the first step. 1Put your pivot here, and use your pencil to draw the arc. 1You say OK, this point and this point. 1So that would be the first step. 1D. 1And I'm all out of problems and I'm out of time. 1See you in the next video.",math_geometry-home_geometry-miscellaneous
" Welcome back. We're ready to do part D, and let me copy and paste that in as well. See, I don't think that's going to need this graph, so let me just remove that with a color other than yellow. It's copy and pasted. I don't know if you can read it, but it's helpful for me to review the problem on our clipboard. OK. The rate at which tickets were sold for t -- for over this range is modeled by r of t-- let me write that in case you can't see it-- is the rate at which tickets were sold. r of t is equal to 550 te to the minus t over 2 tickets per hour. Based on the model, how many tickets were sold by  PM? So my t equals 3-- to the nearest whole number? So that's sometimes important. You don't want to give a decimal answer. So this is the rate at which tickets are sold. So this is the derivative of the total tickets sold function. Or another way that we could write it is the total tickets sold-- so let's call that, I don't know, capital T sub-- well let me-- I don't want to do T of t, that's [UNINTELLIGIBLE] So let's say the tickets sold as a function of time is going to be equal to the definite integral-- well, we could say is at any time t, the tickets sold-- and this is the fundamental theorems calculus, I think it might be one of its correlaries or actually sometimes it is the fundamental theorem of calculus, I always forget my definitions. Between time equals 0 and t-- or if we want to know the tickets sold, between time equals 0 and t is equal to the integral of the rate at which the tickets sold was changing. So that's equal to 550te to the minus t over 2dt. Right? That's it. And so if we want to know how many tickets were sold at time equals 3, that's just equal to the definite integral from 0 to 3, or we could also view it as the area under this curve, from time equals 0 to time equal to 3 of 550te to the minus t over 2dt. Now this integral right here, you can solve it analytically using integration of parts, which I just called the reverse product rule, but you only have 45 minutes to do all three of these problems, and they'll let you use your graphing calculator, and your graphic calculator is excellent at doing definite integrals, and they just want the number, right? So let's use our graphic calculators to get that number. Let's see. I don't want to copy, so how do we do that? We just do second the division button but that's calc-- definite, let me use the definite integral, and like what was, let's see, let me make sure I have that-- 550 let's just use x. 550 times x times second e to the minus x divided by 2. I think that's the whole function. And let's see. My independent variable is x, I've just swapped t for x there, and I'm taking the integral from 0 to 3. Click enter, let the calculator do the work. This would have taken you quite a while if you had to actually do the integral yourself. 972.78, and they want us to round to the nearest whole number. So the nearest whole number is 973. So we say 973 tickets sold by  PM. And we're done. That only took us four minutes. And it would have taken us even less if we didn't have to explain it. Anyway. I will see you in problem number three.",math_calculus-all-old_ap-calc-topic
" We are told that the cosine of 58 degrees is roughly equal to 0.53. And that's roughly equal to, because it just keeps going on and on. I just rounded it to the nearest hundredth. And then we're asked, what is the sine of 32 degrees? And I encourage you to pause this video and try it on your own. And a hint is to look at this right triangle. One of the angles is already labeled 32 degrees. Figure out what all of the angles are, and then use the fundamental definitions, your sohcahtoa definitions, to see if you can figure out what sine of 32 degrees is. So I'm assuming you've given a go at it. Let's work it through now. So we know that the sum of the angles of a triangle add up to 180. Now in a right angle, one of the angles is 90 degrees. So that means that the other two must add up to 90. These two add up to 90 plus another 90 is going to be 180 degrees. Or another way to think about is that the other two non-right angles are going to be complementary. So what plus 32 is equal to 90? Well, 90 minus 32 is 58. So this right over here is going to be 58 degrees. Well, why is that interesting? Well, we already know what the cosine of 58 degrees is equal to. But let's think about it in terms of ratios of the lengths of sides of this right triangle. Let's just write down sohcahtoa. Soh, sine, is opposite over hypotenuse. Cah, cosine, is adjacent over hypotenuse. Toa, tangent, is opposite over adjacent. So we could write down the cosine of 58 degrees, which we already know. If we think about it in terms of these fundamental ratios, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. This is a 58 degree angle. The side that is adjacent to it is-- let me do it in this color-- is side BC right over here. It's one of the sides of the angle, the side of the angle that is not the hypotenuse. The other side, this over here, is a hypotenuse. So this is going to be the adjacent, the length of the adjacent side, BC, over the length of the hypotenuse. The length of the hypotenuse, well, that is AB. Now let's think about what the sine of 32 degrees would be. Well, sine is opposite over hypotenuse. So now we're looking at this 32 degree angle. What side is opposite it? Well, it opens up onto BC. And what's the length of the hypotenuse? It's AB. Notice, the sine of 32 degrees is BC over AB. The cosine of 58 degrees is BC over AB. Or another way of thinking about it, the sine of this angle is the same thing as the cosine of this angle. So we could literally write the sine-- I want to do that in that pink color-- the sine of 32 degrees is equal to the cosine of 58 degrees, which is roughly equal to 0.53. And this is a really, really useful property. The sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complement. So we could write this in general terms. We could write that the sine of some angle is equal to the cosine of its complement, is equal to the cosine of 90 minus theta. Think about it. I could change this entire problem. Instead of making this the sine of 32 degrees, I could make this the sine of 25 degrees. And if someone gave you the cosine of-- what's 90 minus 25?-- if someone gave you the cosine of 65 degrees, then you could think about this as 25. The complement is going to be right over here. This would be 65 degrees. And then you could use the exact same idea.",math_geometry_hs-geo-trig
" -  What we're going to do in this video is tackle some word problems involving ratios. So here, we're told that Yoda Soda is the intergalactic party drink that will have all of your friends saying, mm, good this is. You are throwing a party and you need five liters of Yoda Soda for every 12 guests. If you have 36 guests, how many liters of Yoda Soda do you need? So pause this video and try to figure it out on your own. Well, they tell us the ratio of liters of soda to number of guests. So you need five, it's five liters for every 12 guests is the ratio but we wanna have 36 guests. So if the ratio is five liters of soda for every 12 guests but we're in a situation where we have 36 guests, so this is three times as many guests, we're gonna need three times as many liters of soda. So three times five is 15. Five to 12. Five liters for 12 guests or for five liters for every 12 guests is the same thing as 15 liters for every 36 guests. So to answer that question, how many liters do you need, you need 15 liters. Let's do another one of these. Here, we just have a picture of a bunch of fish in a tank and it says there are eight big fish for every blank small fish and then it says there are four big fish for every blank small fish. So pause this video again and see if you can work through this. Alright, so let's just count the big fish first. So there's one, two, three, wait, let me count this way. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So in this tank, there actually are eight big fish and so let's see how many small fish there are. There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 small fish. So in the tank, for every eight big fish which you see in red, there are 10 small fish but here it says, there are four big fish for every blank small fish. So what would that be? Well, one way to think about it is we have half as many fish or half as many big fish so we divided it by two. So we're gonna have half as many small fish. So we're gonna divide by two. So for every four big fish, there are five small fish and one way to think about it, you could divide the fish evenly into two groups right over here. So let's see, if we can capture, so if you could have, this is, if I divide it like that, here I have one, two, three, four big fish and one, two, three, four, five small fish then in this group I have one, two, three, four big fish and one, two, three, four, five small fish. So every four big fish, there are five small fish. These are equivalent ratios. Let's keep going. So here, we're told an ice cream shop uses the following ingredients to make one sundae. So they use two scoops of ice cream, four spoonfuls of sprinkles, two tablespoons of whipped cream. How many sundaes did the shop make if they used 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles? So pause the video and try to think about it. So there's a couple of ways to think about it. Here, it says, let's see, we're talking about sprinkles. So that's what's relevant here. Four spoonfuls for every one sundae. So we could say that there, so the ratio of spoonfuls to sundaes is four to one. Four spoonfuls, spoonfuls of sprinkles, let me write it this way, let me write sprinkles, sprinkles. How many spoonfuls? How many spoonfuls for one sundae? But here we're talking about using 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles so that is eight times as many. So you're going to be able to use, create eight times as many sundaes. So you're gonna have 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles for every eight sundaes. So how many sundaes did the shop make? Well, they made eight. Let's do one last example. At a dog park, there are 10 black dogs, five brown dogs, two white dogs and 12 multi-color dogs. For every one brown dog, there are two blank dogs. Pause the video and figure out what goes in this blank. Alright, so let's see. There's five brown dogs for every 10 black dogs, five brown dogs for every two white dogs and five brown dogs for every 12 multi-color dogs but here you're saying for every one brown dog, there are two blank dogs. So what type of dog is there a ratio? So for every brown dog, there's twice as many of that type of dog. Well, here, we see for every five brown dogs, there are 10 black dogs. So one way to think about it, the number of black dogs is always gonna be twice the number of brown dogs. So for every one brown dog, there would be two, two black, two black dogs. One way to think about it, the ratio between brown dogs and black dogs and it's kinda counterintuitive. I used the wrong colors here. I should have used brown and black. So let me do that. So the ratio of brown to black is five brown dogs for every 10, 10 black dogs or if you divide both of these numbers by five, you would get one, one brown dog for every two, for every two black dogs and that's exactly what this statement is saying.",math_in-in-class-6-math-india-icse_in-in-6-ratio-and-proportion-icse
" -  What is the area of the figure? So down here we have this one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10-sided figure, and we want to know its area, how many square meters does this figure cover? And we have some measurements, that seems helpful, but what's not too helpful to me is I don't know the special trick to find the area of a 10-sided figure so I've got to think about what I do know and what I do know is the way to find area of a rectangle. So what I can do, because I can see, if I can find any rectangles in here. Here's one rectangle, right there. So I can find the area of that part. Then let's see if I can find any more. Here's another rectangle. So I can find the area of that part. We could call that one a rectangle or a square. And then that leaves us with this last part, which is again, a rectangle. So what we did is, we broke this up or decomposed it into three rectangles and now if I find out how much space this purple one covers, and the blue one and the green one, if I combine those, that would tell me the area of the entire figure, how much space the entire figure covers. So let's start with this one right here. This one is three meters long, so we can kind of divide that by three meters, into three equal meters, and then we've got a width of two meters down here so we can split that in half. So if we draw those lines out, we can see this top row is going to cover one square meter, two square meters, three square meters, and then there's two rows of that, so there's two rows of three square meters for a total of six square meters. This rectangle covers six square meters, so this part of the entire figure covers six square meters. The next one, our measurements are three and a three, so it will have three rows of three square meters or nine square meters, and then finally this purple one has three meters and nine, so we can say it will have three rows of nine or nine rows of three square meters which is 27 square meters. So the area of this purple section, it covers completely 27 square meters. The green covers nine square meters, and the blue covered six square meters. So, if we combine all those areas, all those square meters it covers, that will tell us the area of the entire figure. So we have six square meters, plus nine square meters, plus 27, and we can solve that, six plus nine is 15, 15 plus 27, let's see, five ones and seven ones is 12 ones. We'll just find some space up there. And one 10 and two 10's or a 10 and a 20 is 30. And 30 plus 12 is 42. So the area of the entire figure is 42 square meters.",math_in-in-class-6-math-india-icse_in-in-6-perimeter-and-area-icse
" If you were paying close attention in the last video, an interesting question might have popped up in your brain. We have talked about the intervals over which the function is concave downwards. And then we talked about the interval over which the function is concave upwards. But we see here that there's a point at which we transition from being concave downwards to concave upwards. Before that point, the slope was decreasing, and then the slope starts increasing. The slope was decreasing and then the slope started increasing. So that's one way to look at it. Right here in our function we go from being concave downwards to concave upwards. When you look at our derivative at that point, our derivative went from decreasing to increasing. And when you look at our second derivative at that point, it went from being negative to positive. So this must have some type of a special name you're probably thinking. And you'd be thinking correctly. This point at which we transition from being concave downwards to concave upwards, or the point at which our derivative has a extrema point, or the point at which our second derivative switches signs like this, we call it an inflection point. And the most typical way that people think about how could you test for an inflection point, it's a point, well, conceptually, it's where you go from being a downward opening u to an upward opening u. Or when you go from being concave downwards to concave upwards. But the easiest test is it's a point at which your second derivative switches signs. So in this case, we went from negative to positive. But we could have also switched from being positive to negative. So inflection point, your second derivative f prime prime of x switches signs. Goes from being positive to negative or negative to positive. Switches signs. So this is a case where we went from concave downwards to concave upwards. If we went from concave upwards to concave downwards, like that, then this inflection point up until that point, the slope was increasing. So the second derivative would to be positive. And then the slope is decreasing, so your second derivative would be negative. So here your second derivative is going from positive to negative. Here your second derivative is going from negative to positive. In either case, you are talking about an inflection point.",math_ap-calculus-ab_ab-diff-analytical-applications-new
" In the previous video we were able to apply the binomial theorem in order to figure out what a plus b to fourth power is in order to expand this out. And we did it. And it was a little bit tedious but hopefully you appreciated it. It would have been useful if we did even a higher power-- a plus b to the seventh power, a plus b to the eighth power. But what I want to do in this video is show you that there's another way of thinking about it and this would be using ""Pascal's Triangle"". And if we have time we'll also think about why these two ideas are so closely related. So instead of doing a plus b to the fourth using this traditional binomial theorem-- I guess you could say-- formula right over here, I'm going to calculate it using Pascal's triangle and some of the patterns that we know about the expansion. So once again let me write down what we're trying to calculate. We're trying to calculate a plus b to the fourth power-- I'll just do this in a different color-- to the fourth power. So what I'm going to do is set up Pascal's triangle. So Pascal's triangle-- so we'll start with a one at the top. And one way to think about it is, it's a triangle where if you start it up here, at each level you're really counting the different ways that you can get to the different nodes. So one-- and so I'm going to set up a triangle. So if I start here there's only one way I can get here and there's only one way that I could get there. But now this third level-- if I were to say how many ways can I get here-- well, one way to get here, one way to get here. So there's two ways to get here. One way to get there, one way to get there. The only way I get there is like that, the only way I can get there is like that. But the way I could get here, I could go like this, or I could go like this. And then we could add a fourth level where-- let's see, if I have-- there's only one way to go there but there's three ways to go here. One plus two. How are there three ways? You could go like this, you could go like this, or you could go like that. Same exact logic: there's three ways to get to this point. And then there's only one way to get to that point right over there. And so let's add a fifth level because this was actually what we care about when we think about something to the fourth power. This is essentially zeroth power-- binomial to zeroth power, first power, second power, third power. So let's go to the fourth power. So how many ways are there to get here? Well I just have to go all the way straight down along this left side to get here, so there's only one way. There's four ways to get here. I could go like that, I could go like that, I could go like that, and I can go like that. There's six ways to go here. Three ways to get to this place, three ways to get to this place. So six ways to get to that and, if you have the time, you could figure that out. There's three plus one-- four ways to get here. And then there's one way to get there. And now I'm claiming that these are the coefficients when I'm taking something to the-- if I'm taking something to the zeroth power. This is if I'm taking a binomial to the first power, to the second power. Obviously a binomial to the first power, the coefficients on a and b are just one and one. But when you square it, it would be a squared plus two ab plus b squared. If you take the third power, these are the coefficients-- third power. And to the fourth power, these are the coefficients. So let's write them down. The coefficients, I'm claiming, are going to be one, four, six, four, and one. And how do I know what the powers of a and b are going to be? Well I start a, I start this first term, at the highest power: a to the fourth. And then I go down from there. a to the fourth, a to the third, a squared, a to the first, and I guess I could write a to the zero which of course is just one. And then for the second term I start at the lowest power, at zero. And then b to first, b squared, b to the third power, and then b to the fourth, and then I just add those terms together. And there you have it. I have just figured out the expansion of a plus b to the fourth power. It's exactly what I just wrote down. This term right over here, a to the fourth, that's what this term is. One a to the fourth b to the zero: that's just a to the fourth. This term right over here is equivalent to this term right over there. And so I guess you see that this gave me an equivalent result. Now an interesting question is 'why did this work?' And I encourage you to pause this video and think about it on your own. Well, to realize why it works let's just go to these first levels right over here. If I just were to take a plus b to the second power. a plus b to the second power. This is going to be, we've already seen it, this is going to be a plus b times a plus b so let me just write that down: a plus b times a plus b. So we have an a, an a. We have a b, and a b. We're going to add these together. And then when you multiply it, you have-- so this is going to be equal to a times a. You get a squared. And that's the only way. That's the only way to get an a squared term. There's only one way of getting an a squared term. Then you're going to have plus a times b. So-- plus a times b. And then you're going to have plus this b times that a so that's going to be another a times b. Plus b times b which is b squared. Now this is interesting right over here. How many ways can you get an a squared term? Well there's only one way. You're multiplying this a times that a. There's one way of getting there. Now how many ways are there of getting the b squared term? How many ways are there of getting the b squared term? Well there's only one way. Multiply this b times this b. There's only one way of getting that. But how many ways are there of getting the ab term? The a to the first b to the first term. Well there's two ways. You can multiply this a times that b, or this b times that a. There are-- just hit the point home-- there are two ways, two ways of getting an ab term. And so, when you take the sum of these two you are left with a squared plus two times ab plus b squared. Notice the exact same coefficients: one two one, one two one. Why is that like that? Well there is only one way to get an a squared, there's two ways to get an ab, and there's only one way to get a b squared. If you set it to the third power you'd say okay, there's only one way to get to a to the third power. You just multiply the first a's all together. And there is only one way to get to b to the third power. But there's three ways to get to a squared b. And you could multiply it out, and we did it. We did it all the way back over here. There's three ways to get a squared b. We saw that right over there. And there are three ways to get a b squared. Three ways to get a b squared. And if you sum this up you have the expansion of a plus b to the third power. So hopefully you found that interesting.",math_engageny-precalc_precalc-3
" Let's say that I've got some angle theta, some angle theta right over here. And I'm drawing it on our unit circle with a typical convention that we started with a ray that's along the positive X axis, and the terminal side of this angle, is the terminal side of the angle, where it intersects the unit circle, determines essentially the sine and cosine of that theta, so the cosine of theta is the X... is the... let me just set a color I haven't used before. The cosine of theta is the X coordinate of where this terminal ray intersects the unit circle. Or another way of thinking about it is the cosine of theta is the length of what I'm drawing in purple right over here. It's this length. That length right over there is cosine of theta, and the sine of theta is the Y coordinate. Or another way of thinking about it the sine of theta is the length of this line right over here. The how high you are above the X axis, that is essentially the Y coordinate, and so the length of that is sine theta. And this makes sense, this actually shows why the unit circle definition is an extension of the Soh Cah Toa definition. Remember, Soh Cah Toa. Let me write it down. Soh Cah Toa. Soh Cah Toa. So sine is opposite over hypotenuse. So if I want to do the sine of theta, what's it going to be? So if I think about the sine of theta, sine of theta by the Soh Cah Toa definition, it's going to be equal to the length of the opposite side. Well, we're saying that that's sine of theta, it's sine of theta, over the hypotenuse. Well the hypotenuse here, this is a unit circle, so it's going to be one. So this shows that this is consistent. Or another way of thinking about it, sine of theta is equal to the opposite side over the hypotenuse. In this case it's going to be equal to the opposite side, and what's the hypotenuse? This is a unit circle, so it's going to be one. In this case, sine of theta is equal to the length of the opposite side. The length of the opposite side is equal to sine theta. And same exact logic. The cosine of theta is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse, is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse. And so that's... since the hypotenuse is equal to one, it's just the length of the adjacent side, so cosine of theta is the length of the adjacent side. So this is all a little bit of review, just showing how the unit circle definition is an extension of the Soh Cah Toa definition. But now let's do something interesting. This is the angle theta. Let's think about the angle theta plus pi over two. So the angle theta plus pi over two. So if I were to essentially add pi over two to this, I'm going to get a ray that is perpendicular to the first ray, pi over two. If we think in degrees, pi over two radians, so when I say theta plus pi over two, I'm talking in radians. Pi over two radians is equivalent to 90 degrees. So we're essentially adding 90 degrees to it. So this angle right over here, that angle right over here is theta plus pi over two. Now, what I want to explore in this video, and I guess this is the interesting part of the video, is can we relate sin of theta plus pi over two to somehow sine of theta or cosine of theta? I encourage you to pause this video and try to think this through on your own before I work it out. Well let's think about what sine of theta plus pi over two is. We know from the unit circle definition, the sine of this angle, which is theta plus pi over two, is the Y coordinate. It's that, it's this value right over here. Or another way of thinking about it, it's the length of this line in magenta. This right over here is the sine of theta, plus pi over two. So that right over there. Now how does that relate to what we have over here? Well when you look at it, it looks like we just took this triangle, and we just kind of... we rotated it. We rotated it counter clockwise by 90 degrees, which essentially what we did do. Because we took this terminal side, and we added 90 degrees to it, or pi over two radians. And if you want to get a little bit more rigorous about it, if this whole white angle here is theta plus pi over two, and the part that's in the first quadrant is pi over two, then this part right over here, that must be equal to theta. And if we think about it, if we try to relate the side this side that I've put in magenta relative to this angle theta using the Soh Cah Toa definition, here, relative to this angle theta in yellow, this is the adjacent side. So let's think about it a little bit. So if we were.. so what deals with the adjacent and the hypotenuse, and in this case of course our hypotenuse has length one, this is a unit circle, what cosine deals with adjacent and hypotenuse? So we could say that the cosine of this theta so the cosine of that theta is equal to the adjacent side, the length of the adjacent side which we already know is sine of theta plus pi over two. Let me write it this way. Sine of theta plus pi over two. over the hypotenuse. Over the hypotenuse, which is just one, so that doesn't change its value. So that was pretty neat. Just like that, we were able to come up with a pretty neat relationship between cosine and sine. The cosine of theta is equal to sine of theta plus pi over two, or you could say sine of theta plus pi over two is equal to cosine of theta. Now what I encourage you to do is, after this video, see if you can come up with other results. Think about what happens to... what sine of theta relates to? Or what cosine of theta plus pi over two might relate to? So I encourage you to explore that on your own.",math_engageny-precalc_precalc-4
" -  Let's continue thinking about how rational agents make decisions. So here we're told that Sally runs a business that only sells hamburgers in a building she owns. Every month, they sell 5,000 hamburgers at $5 per hamburger. She spends $2 per hamburger on supplies, bread, meat, lettuce, et cetera. She also pays Mike and Raj each $2,500 per month to work at the restaurant. Finally, utilities cost $500 per month. Sally works full-time at the restaurant and keeps the accounting profits for herself. What is the accounting profit of the business? So pause this video and see if you can figure that out. All right now let's think about this together. We're gonna think about it in terms of some of the types of costs we've thought about in the past. So when we think about benefits, and here we could think about it to a firm, although it's fully owned by Sally, the benefit to a firm of doing business is its revenue. So the total revenue that she collects, and everything we're gonna be doing is going to be per month, so her total revenue is going to be her price times quantity so it's going to be 5,000 hamburgers at $5 per hamburger. So that is going to be $25,000. Once again, all of this is going to be per month. So once again, we can view this as the total benefit that the firm, that her business, is getting. And now let's think about the costs. So first we could think about the cost of her supplies. It's oftentimes referred to costs of goods sold, but I'll just write supplies here. So costs, costs colon, so let's put supplies, supplies. That would be 5,000 hamburgers times $2 per hamburger, so that's a $10,000 cost, $10,000. Then she has the cost of her employees. So employees, I'll just write it, I'll abbreviate it like that. What's that going to be? Well she has two folks at $2,500 per month each. So that's going to be $5,000, two times $2,500, $5,000. And then last but not least, she has her utilities. So utilities, let's do util for short. That's going to be $500 per month. And so from this we can calculate the accounting profit. So we get the accounting profit, accounting profit, is going to be 25,000 minus 15,500. That's going to be $9,500 per month. And she gets to keep all of this, and so this seems like a pretty good amount of money to be earning. She's earning six figures a year. But the question is, is it rational for her to do this? Well some of you might be correctly thinking, well in order to determine whether it's rational for her to continue running this business, we have to know what the implicit costs are. Here we've only just looked at the explicit costs, and the most important of the implicit costs is the opportunity cost. And to factor that, we have to know, well maybe what she could've rented her building out, if she wasn't running this burger business, and maybe what she could do with her time if she wasn't working at the business full-time. So we need a little bit more information and let's see if we can get that. So now we are told that Sally could rent out her building for $5,000 per month. She can also make $6,000 per month as an accountant. Based on this, what is the economic profit of her business? So pause this video and see if you can figure this out. Well one way to think about it is, we can start with our accounting profit and then subtract out all the implicit costs, especially these opportunity costs right over here. So her opportunity cost, opportunity costs, are going to be per month, well if she doesn't run this business, she could rent out her building for $5,000 per month and then if she wasn't doing this full-time, she could make $6,000 per month as an accountant, $6,000 right over there. And so her opportunity costs are a total of $11,000. And so now her economic profit would be her total benefit minus her explicit costs minus her implicit costs. Her economic profit, economic profit, is going to be, well we could start at the 9,500 and subtract the 11,000, it is negative $1,500. It's important to realize, because economic profit always factors in the explicit costs and then other potential implicit costs, economic profit will never be higher than accounting profit. And assuming there are some implicit costs, it'll always be lower than accounting profit. So now based on all of what we've explored, is it rational for Sally to continue running her burger business? Well based on the information we've been given, it doesn't seem rational for her to continue running her burger business. She makes $9,500 in accounting profit from the business, but she's incurring $11,000 of opportunity cost to do so. And that's what makes her economic profit negative. This is not rational. Now if we had more information, maybe she hates being an accountant. Maybe there's a benefit for her working at the burger business. She has more flexibility with her time, she likes being self-employed, she doesn't have to listen to her manager tell her want to do. If that were the case, then it would change the calculations some because there would be an extra benefit from her running her burger joint. But we don't know, and based on the information we have, it doesn't seem rational for her to continue.",economics-finance-domain_ap-microeconomics_basic-economic-concepts
" -  I see a lot of mistakes when students draw resoce structures, and so I wanted to make a video on some of the more common mistakes that I've seen. So let's say we wanted to draw a resoce structure for this carbocation. Some students would take these electrons and move them down to here and say, all right, so on the right, now, I would have this, and this is my resoce structure. Let me highlight those electrons in blue here, so these electrons here move down to here. But this is incorrect, so let me write ""no"" here. So the resoce structure on the right, this is an incorrect resoce structure, why is this resoce structure not possible? Well, let's draw in the hydrogens on the carbons, and it will be much more obvious. So this carbon right here has one hydrogen on it, same with this carbon, and this carbon right here has two hydrogens on it, and the carbon with a plus one formal charge must have one hydrogen. So let's put in those hydrogens for the resoce structure on the right, and it should be obvious why this resoce structure is incorrect. Let's focus in on this carbon right here, the one I marked in red. How many bonds are there to that carbon? Well here's one bond, two, three, four, and five, that's five bonds to a carbon, that does not happen, you can't show carbon with five bonds, because that would be 10 electrons around this carbon, and carbon can never exceed an octet of electrons. Because of carbon's position on the periodic table, in the second period, there's four orbitals, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons, which gives us four times two, which is eight. So carbon can never exceed an octet. There's another reason why this is wrong. If we go to this top carbon here, there's only three bonds around that carbon, so that carbon would have a plus one formal charge. So we added another formal charge, and we have carbon with five bonds, so this is incorrect, this is not a correct resoce structure. So what is the proper resoce structure to draw? Well, let's show that down here. You take your electrons, and you move them in the direction of the positive charge, of the positive one formal charge, and so let's show that. The electrons in, let me make them blue again, the electrons in blue move over to here, like that. And that moves the positive formal charge over to this carbon. If we draw in our hydrogens, it'll be clear why this is correct. So we put in a hydrogen here, we put in a hydrogen here, and we put in a hydrogen here. So let me draw in those three hydrogens on the right. Okay, now it's very obvious, let me point this out in red. It's obvious that this carbon here in red has a plus one formal charge, it has three bonds around it. So one, two, and three. And this carbon, this carbon over here on the right that had the plus one formal charge, now its formal charge is zero, because there are four bonds around it. So one, two, three and four, so now the formal charge is zero. So this is the correct resoce structure. Now, it looks a little bit confusing when I have those hydrogens drawn in there, which is why we leave them off. Let me go ahead and draw it again on the right just for clarity. That's why we leave off those hydrogens when we\re drawing our resoce structures, because they get in the way, and once you understand what's going on it's not necessary to draw in those hydrogens. Let's do another example, and again, I'll start with the wrong way to do it, and then we'll talk about the correct way. So, a student might say, all right, I have a negative one formal charge on this nitrogen, so I could take this lone pair of electrons and move into here, which would push these electrons over to here, so let me go ahead and draw what some students might think is a correct resoce structure. So let me put in my lone pair of electrons, and let's follow some electrons along. So electrons in light blue on this nitrogen move into here, and electrons in, let's say dark blue, move down to here. And then finally, electrons in magenta remain behind on the nitrogen. So on the right, why is this not a correct resoce structure? So again, this is the wrong way to do it. Well, think about your hydrogens. So we'll start with this carbon right here, this carbon has one hydrogen, this carbon has one hydrogen, and this carbon down here has two. So if we put in those hydrogens over here on the right, hopefully it's obvious why this is incorrect. Let's look at this carbon down at the bottom of the ring, so this carbon right here I just marked in red. How many bonds do we have? Well, here's one, two, three, four, and five, so there are five bonds to that carbon, and we know carbon can never have five bonds. Carbon can never exceed an octet of electrons. So immediately we know that this is not a correct resoce structure. All right, let's talk about the right way to do it. So you take these electrons, and you move them into here, and then these (mumbles) electrons have to go somewhere, and they move out onto this carbon, so now, let's draw the correct other resoce structure here. So we'll put in our double bond, we'll put our electrons on this carbon, that gives this carbon a negative one formal charge, and then we have some electrons, a lone pair of electrons left on the nitrogen. I'll use the same colors as before, so these electrons right here in light blue move in to form our double bond. The electrons in dark blue move off onto this carbon, so the electrons in dark blue are on this carbon that I just marked in dark blue which gives that carbon a negative one formal charge. And the electrons in magenta remain behind on the nitrogen. All right, the reason why the carbon -- now I'll go ahead and mark it in a different color. This carbon I just marked in magenta has a negative one formal charge, is because, remember, there's one hydrogen on that carbon, so let me draw in that hydrogen over here. Let me see if I can squeeze it in over here like that. This carbon right here has three bonds to it and a lone pair of electrons, which gives that carbon in magenta a negative one formal charge. Now this nitrogen over here would have a formal charge equal to zero. And so this on the right, would be the correct resoce structure, and again, drawing in hydrogens is a waste of time, it gets in the way. Let me go ahead and draw the resoce structure again, I'll take out that hydrogen so it'll look cleaner, and it also takes less time when you're not drawing in all of your hydrogens. So you just put a lone pair of electrons and write a negative one formal charge, and you have to know that there's still a hydrogen on this carbon that I marked in magenta. So if you're having trouble drawing resoce structures, usually the problem is not thinking about your hydrogens, forgetting about putting in your hydrogens. And once you put those in, it's a lot easier to see if your dot structure, if your resoce structure, I should say, is correct, so be careful about that. And resoce structures are just practice. The more you draw, the better you're going to get and if you make a mistake, it's not a big deal. You learn from your mistake, and you keep on practicing.",science_organic-chemistry_organic-structures
" P is the center of the green arc. So this is p right over here. The measure of angle P is 0.4 radians, and the length of the radius is 5 units. That's this length right over here. Find the length of the green arc. So just to kind of conceptualize this a little bit, P, you can imagine, is the center of this larger circle. And this angle right over here that has a measure of 0.4 radians, it intercepts this green arc right over here. In order to figure this out-- and actually, I encourage you to pause this video now and try to think about this question on your own. How long is this arc, given the information that they've given us? Well, all we have to do is remind ourselves what a radian is. One way to think about a radian is if you look at the arc that the angle intercepts, which is this green arc, if you think about its length, the length of this green arc is going to be 0.4 radii. One way to think about radians is if this angle is 0.4 radians, that means that the arc that it intercepts is going to be 0.4 radii long. So this length we could write as 0.4 radii. Or ""radiuses,"" but ""radii"" is the proper term. Now, we don't want our length in terms of radii. We want our length in terms of whatever units the radius is, these kind of 5 units. Well, we know that each radius has a length of 5, that our radius of the circle has a length of 5. So this is going to be 0.4 radii times 5-- and you know they just call it units right over here. I'll put it in quotes because it's kind of a generic term-- 5 units per radii. So the radii cancel out. We're left with just the units, which is what we want. So 0.4 times 5 is 2. So this is going to be equal to 2. So just as a refresher again, when the angle measure in radians, one way to think about it is the arc that it intercepts, that's going to be this many radii long. Well, if each radius is 5 units, it's going to be 0.4 times 5 units long, or 2.",math_engageny-geo_geo-5
" Let's see if we can take the derivative with respect to x of 2 to the x power. And you might say, hold on a second. We know how to take the derivative of e to the x. But what about a base like 2? We don't know what to do with 2. And the key here is to rewrite 2 to the x so that we essentially have it as e to some power. And the key there is to rewrite 2. So how can we rewrite 2 so it is e to some power? Well, let's think about what e to the natural log of 2 power is. The natural log of 2 is the power that I would have to raise e to to get to 2. So if we actually raise e to that power, we are going to get to 2. So what we could do, instead of writing 2 to the x, we could rewrite this as e. We could rewrite 2 as e to the natural log of 2, and then raise that to the x power. So this is the x power in yellow. And so let's do that right over here. So instead of taking the derivative with respect to x of 2 to the x, let's say, let's just take the derivative with respect to x of the exact same expression rewritten, of e to the natural log of 2 raised to the x power. Let me put this x in that same color, dx. Now we know from our exponent properties if we raise something to some power, and then raise that to another power, we can take the product of the two powers. Let me rewrite this just to remember. If I have a to b, and then I raise that to the c power, this is the exact same thing as a to the b times c power. So we can utilize that exponent property right here to rewrite this as being equal to the derivative with respect to x of e to the natural log of 2 times x. And what's neat about this is now we've got this into a form of e to the something. So we can essentially use the chain rule to evaluate this. So this derivative is going to be equal to the derivative of e to the something with respect to that something. Well, the derivative e to the something with respect to that something is just e to that something. So it's going to be equal to e to the natural log of 2 times x. So let me make it clear what I just did here. This right over here is the derivative of e to the natural log of 2 times x with respect to the natural log of 2-- let me make it a little bit clearer-- with respect to the natural log of 2 times x. So we took the derivative of e to the something with respect to that something-- that's this right here, it's just e to that something. And then we're going to multiply that by, this is just an application of the chain rule, of the derivative of that something with respect to x. So the derivative of natural log of 2 times x with respect to x is just going to be natural log of 2. This is just going to be natural log of 2. The derivative of a times x is just going to be equal to a. This is just the coefficient on the x. And just to be clear, this is the derivative of natural log of 2 times x with respect to x. So we're essentially done. But we can simplify this even further. This thing right over here can be rewritten. And let me draw a line here just to make it clear that this equals sign is a continuation from what we did up there. But this e to the natural log of 2x, we can rewrite that, using this exact same exponent property, as e to the natural log of 2, and then all of that raised to the x power. And of course, we're multiplying it times the natural log of 2, so times the natural log of 2. Well, what is e to the natural log of 2? Well, we already figured that out. That is exactly equal to 2. This right over here is equal to 2. And so now we can simplify. This whole thing, the derivative of 2 to the x, is equal to-- and I'll switch the order a little bit-- it is the natural log of 2, that's this part right over here, times 2 to the x. Or we could write it as 2 to the x times the natural log of 2.",math_calculus-all-old_taking-derivatives-calc
" To which intervals could we restrict f of x is equal to cosine of x minus pi over four, so that f of x is invertible? And they show us what cosine of x minus pi over four, what it looks like, the graph of it. So lets just think about what it means for a function to be invertible. A function is a mapping from a set of elements that we would call the domain, so let me, my pen is a little off today so lets see if it works ok. So this right here is our domain. And this over here is our range. And a function maps from an element in our domain, to an element in our range. That's what a function does. Now the inverse of the function maps from that element in the range to the element in the domain. So that over there would be f inverse. If that's the direction of the function, that's the direction of f inverse. Now, a function is not invertible, one of the situations in which a function is not invertible you could have a function where two elements of the domain map to the same element of the range. So both of these elements map to that element of the range, so both of these are the function, but then, if this is the case, you're not going to be able to create a function that maps the other way, because if you input this into the inverse function, where do you go? Do you go to that element of the domain? Or do you go to that element right over there? So one way to think about it is, you need a one to one mapping. For each element of the range, there's only one element of the domain that gets you there. Or another way to think about it, you could try to draw a horizontal line on the graph of the function and see if it crosses through the function more than once. And you could see that this is indeed the case for this function right over here. If I did a horizontal line, right over here. Now why is this the issue? Well this is showing, actually let me show a number that's a little bit easier to look at. So lets say I drew the horizontal line right over here. Now why is this horizontal line an issue? Well, showing us the part of the domain that's being graphed here, that there's several points that map to the same element of the range. They're mapping to 0.5. 0.5, this value right over here. When you take f of that is equal to 0.5, f of this is equal to 0.5, f of this right over here is 0.5. So if you have multiple elements of your domain mapping to the same element of the range, then the function will not be invertible for that domain. So really what we're going to do is, we're going to try to restrict the domain so that, for that domain, if I were to essentially apply this, what I call the horizontal line test, I'd only intersect the function once. So lets look at the graph of the function once. So lets look at these choices. So the first one is an open set from -5 pi over four. -5 pi over four, so that's pi, that's negative pi, and another fourth of pi. So that's, I think, starting right over here, going all the way to negative 1/4th pi. So that's this domain right over here. Let me do this in a new color. So that's this, and this does not include the two endpoints. So here I can still apply the horizontal line and, in that domain, I can show that there's two members of the domain that are mapping to the same element in the range, and so if I'm trying to construct the inverse of that, what would this element, which I guess is -0.6, what would that f inverse of -0.6 be? Would it be this value here? Or would it be this value here? I would rule this one out. Let's see, negative pi to pi. I'll do this in this color right over here. Negative pi to pi. This is a fairly, so once again, this is enclosed, so we're including the two boundaries, we're including negative pi and pi in the domain. But once again over that interval, I could apply my horizontal line here and notice, or actually I could even apply the original one that I did in blue, and notice there's multiple elements of the domain that map to, say 0.5. So what would f inverse of 0.5 be? You can't construct a function where it maps only to one element of the domain, so we could rule this one out right as well. Now, negative 1/2 pi to positive 1/2 pi. So negative 1/2 pi, so let me, I'm running out of colors. So negative 1/2 pi to positive 1/2 pi, This one is interesting, if I apply a horizontal line there, there, there, so lets see, but if I apply a horizontal line right over here I do intersect the function twice, so I have two members of this domain mapping to the same element of the range, so I can rule that one out as well. And I'm left with one last choice. I'm hoping this one will work out. So 1/2 pi, it's an open set, so 1/2 pi, right over there, to five pi over four. So that's pi and another 1/4th, so that's right over there. And lets see, this is, if I were to look at the graph here, it seems like it would pass the horizontal line test. At any point here I could make a horizontal line over that domain. Actually, let me do it for the whole domain. So you see that. For the whole domain. And I'm only intersecting the function once. So, for every element of the range that we're mapping to, there's only one element in our domain that is mapping to it. It's passing our horizontal line test, so I would check this one right over there.",math_engageny-precalc_precalc-3
" All of the reactions we've looked at so far have been of the form lowercase a moles of the molecule uppercase A, plus lowercase b moles of a molecule uppercase B. They react to form the product or the products. Let's just say they have a couple of products. I could have had as many molecules here as I wanted. Let's say c moles of the molecule C plus d moles of the molecule capital D. And the idea here is that they went in one direction. And if we did a little energy diagram, just going off of the kinematics video we just did, if that's the reaction, or how the reaction progresses, you could imagine that here you have it at a higher energy state. You have lowercase a moles of capital A molecule, plus lowercase b moles of capital B molecule, and you have some activation energy. And then you get to a more stable state or a lower energy level here, where it's lowercase c moles of C molecule plus lowercase d moles of the D moles, and of course, you had some activation energy. It only goes in this direction. Once you get here, it's very hard to go back. So that if you came back and looked at this-- if you get enough of A and B-- you'll just be sitting with molecules of C and D. It'll only go in this direction. But that's not how it happens in reality. In reality-- well, it sometimes happens like this in reality where the reaction can only go in one direction. But in a lot of cases, the reaction can actually go in both directions. So we could write, instead of this one-way reaction, we could write a two-way reaction like this. And not to confuse you too much, these are the number of moles or the ratios of the molecules I'm adding up, and they become relevant in a second. So let's say I have lowercase a moles of this molecule plus lowercase b moles of this molecule, and then they react to form lowercase c moles of this molecule plus lowercase d moles of that molecule. Sometimes the reaction can go in both directions. And to do that, to just show an equilibrium reaction, you do these arrows that go in both directions. That means that, hey, some of this is going to start forming into some of this. But at the same time, some of this might start forming into some of this. And at some point, I'm going to be reaching an equilibrium. When the rate of reaction of molecules going in that direction is equal to the number of molecules going in the other direction, then I'm going to reach some type of equilibrium. Now, why would this happen as opposed to that? And I can think of one situation. If we draw this energy diagram again. Maybe both of these have similar or not so different energy states. There could be other reasons, but this is the one that comes to my mind. Maybe the energy states look something like this. On this side, you have the A plus B, and then you need some activation energy. And then maybe the C plus D, maybe it's a little bit of a lower potential, but it's not that much lower. So maybe they're favored to go in this direction, because this is a more stable state. So this is the A plus B, but here you have the C plus D. But it's not ridiculous to go this way either. So most of it might go that way, but some of it might go this way. If some of these molecules just have the right amount of kinetic energy, they can surmount this activation energy and then go backwards to that side of it. And the study of this is called equilibrium, where you're looking at the concentrations of the different molecules. And just to compare that to kinetics, kinetics was how fast is this is going to happen? Or what can I do to change the activation, this hump here? Equilibrium is studying what will be the concentrations of the different molecules that end up, once the rate going in this direction is equal to the rate going in that direction. And I want to be clear. Equilibrium is where the rate going in the forward direction is equal to the rate going in the reverse direction. It doesn't mean that the concentrations of the two things are equal. You might end up with 25% of your eventual solution's concentration to be A and B and 75% here. All we know is that at some point, you've reached an-- equilibrium just means that those concentrations won't change anymore. And just to give you an example what I mean here, I could have written-- let's see, this is actually the Haber process. I could write nitrogen gas plus 3 hydrogen gases. These are all in gas form, so I can put a little g in parentheses. Actually, it's an equilibrium reaction, and it produces 2 moles of ammonia. It's called the Haber process. We could talk about that in another video. So in this case, we could say a is just 1, this lowercase a. Capital A is the nitrogen molecule. Lowercase b is 3. Uppercase B is the hydrogen molecule. And then lowercase c is the number of moles of ammonia and uppercase C is the ammonia molecule itself. I just want you to realize this is just an abstract way of describing a whole set of equations. Now, what's interesting in equilibrium reactions is that you can define a constant called the equilibrium constant. It's defined as the constant of equilibrium. Let me switch colors. I'm using this light blue too much. The equilibrium constant is defined as you take the products, or the right-hand side-- but if it goes in both directions, you can obviously go in either direction. But let's say that this is the forward direction going from A plus B to C plus D. So you take the products, you take the concentration of each of the products, and you multiply them by each other, and you raise them to the mole ratios that you're taking. So in this case, it would be the concentration of big C raised to the lowercase c power and the concentration of big D raised to the lowercase d power. And when I say concentration, they usually-- especially what you see in your intro chemistry classes, the concentration is going to be measured in molarity, which, just as a review, is moles per liter. A couple of videos ago, when I taught you what molarity was, I said, you know, moles per liter--- I don't like it so much because the volume of your fluid or your gas you're dealing with is dependent on temperature. So I didn't like using molarity. But in this case, it's kind of OK. Because this equilibrium constant is also only true for a given temperature. We assume it for a given temperature, and I'll show you how we use it in a second. But it's defined as the concentrations of the products to the powers. And also, if I have time, maybe I'll do it in the next video. The intuition why you're raising it to the power divided by the concentrations of the reactants, or the things on the left-hand side of the equilibrium reaction. So capital A to the lowercase a divided by capital B to the lowercase B. And what's interesting about this, and this is a bit of a simplification, because this doesn't apply to all reactions. But to most things that you're going to encounter in an intro chemistry class, this is true, that once you establish this equilibrium constant for a certain temperature-- it's only true for a certain temperature-- then you can change the concentrations and then be able to predict what the resulting concentrations are going to be. Let me give you an example. So let's say that after you did this equilibrium reaction-- and actually, just to make things hit home a little bit, let me take this Haber process reaction and write it in the same form. So if I wanted to write the equilibrium constant for the Haber reaction, or if I wanted to calculate it, I would let this reaction go at some temperature. So this is only true at-- let's say we're doing it at 25 Celsius, which is roughly room temperature. So what I would do is I would take the products. So the only product is ammonia, NH3. I raise it to the power of the number of moles that's produced for every 1 mole of nitrogen gas and 3 moles of hydrogen. So I raise it to the power of 2. So that's what that gets me. And I divide it by the reactants. So 1 mole of nitrogen, so I would just put the concentration of the nitrogen, plus 3 moles of hydrogen-- oh, no, no. I shouldn't write a plus there. It's multiplied. So times the hydrogen, and I raise it to the third power, because for every 1 mole of nitrogen, I have 3 moles of hydrogen and then 2 moles of ammonia. And if I were to calculate this, remember, when I put these in brackets, I'm figuring out the concentration. So I would have to figure out the moles per liter. Or sometimes they say, the molarity of each of these things, and it'll get me some constant. If I change it, I can go and calculate the rest, so let me just do an example right now. So let's say I have 1 mole of molecule A plus 2 moles of molecule B are in equilibrium with 3 moles of molecule C. And let's say that once we're in equilibrium, we go and we measure the concentrations, and we figure out that the concentration of A is 1 molar, which is equal to 1 mole per liter. That's the concentration of A. 1We figure out that once we're in equilibrium, the 1concentration of B is equal to 3 molar, which 1means 3 moles per liter. 1And let's say that once we're in that equilibrium, the 1concentration of C is equal to point-- well, I don't want to 1do something too-- let's say it's equal to 1 molar as well. 1I should get rid of that point there, because I don't want to 1say 0.1 molar, so it's just 1 molar. 1So if we wanted to calculate the equilibrium constant for 1this reaction, we just take C, the concentration of C over 1here, so let's see. 1The equilibrium constant is equal to the concentration of 1C to the third power divided by the concentration of A to 1the first power-- because there's only 1 mole of A for 1every 3 of C and 2 of B-- times the concentration of-- 1I'll do it in that color-- B to the third power. 1So if we needed to calculate this, concentration of C is 1 1molar, and we're raising it to the third power, divided by 1concentration of A is 1 molar times the concentration of B, 1which is 3 molars, to the third power. 1So this is equal to 1/27. 1There's a couple of things we can think about. 1The fact that this is less than 1, what does that mean? 1Well, that means that our concentration of our reactants 1is much larger than the concentration of the products, 1where we view just the products as whatever's on the 1right-hand side of the equation. 1So once this reaction goes to equilibrium, we're still left 1with a lot more of this than this. 1And because we're left with a lot more of that, our 1equilibrium constant is less than 1, which means that the 1reaction favors this direction. 1It favors the backward direction. 1Think about it. 1Because there's more of this, this must be happening more 1than the left-to-right reaction. 1The left to right might be a small direction like this, 1while more is happening there, and that's why we're finding 1more reaction here, and that causes the equilibrium 1constant to be less than 1. 1On the other hand, if the equilibrium constant was 1greater than 1, that means that this numerator is greater 1than this denominator. 1Which would imply that you have more concentration-- once 1you're in equilibrium, you end up with a lot more of the 1stuff on the right than you end up with the stuff on the 1left, so then that means the reaction would be going in the 1forward direction. 1The other interesting thing is you can then figure out, well, 1what happens if I add another mole of A to the reaction? 1So let's say I throw some A into the reaction. 1I add some concentration of A. 1So now my new A is equal to 2. 1Let's say my new A is equal to 2. 1Let's say my new B, let's say that I want to-- well, 1actually, we can figure out the relation between the-- 1actually, instead of going into this situation where I 1change the concentration, let me do that in the next video, 1because I just realized that I'm running very low on time. 1But hopefully, you got a good sense of what the equilibrium 1constant is all about and how it's 1measured or how it's defined. 1And in the next video, we're going to talk a little bit 1about how else it could be useful. 1In this video, you just said, oh, if it's less than 1, that 1means that the backward reaction is favored. 1If it's greater than 1, the forward reaction is favored. 1In the next video, we'll get a little intuition, hopefully, 1on why it is defined this way as opposed to, say, this way. 1My intuition said, hey, why isn't it three times the 1concentration of C divided by one times the concentration of 1A plus three times the concentration of B? 1This might have been more intuitive to me, but this 1isn't the case. 1This is what actually is constant, regardless of how 1you change the concentrations of the various reactants. 1So maybe we'll talk a little bit about why this is true and 1not necessarily this.",science_ap-chemistry_chemical-equilibrium-ap
" -  Shinji commutes to work and he worries about running out of fuel. The amount of fuel he uses follows a normal distribution for each part of his commute, but the amount of fuel he uses on the way home varies more. The amounts of fuel he uses for each part of the commute are also independent of each other. Here are summary statistics for the amount of fuel Shinji uses for each part of his commute. So when he goes to work he uses a mean of 10 liters of fuel, with a standard deviation of 1.5 liters. And on the way home, he also has a mean of 10 liters, but there is more variation. There is more spread. He has a standard deviation of two liters. Suppose that Shinji has 25 liters of fuel in his tank and he intends to drive to work and back home. What is the probability that Shinji runs out of fuel? All right, this is really interesting. We have the distributions for the amount of fuel he uses to work and to home, and they say that these are normal distributions. They say that right over here, follows a normal distribution. But here we're talking about the total amount of fuel he has to go to work and to go home. So what we wanna do is come up with a total distribution, home and back, I guess you could say. We could say, call this work plus home. Home and back. If you have two random variables that can be described by normal distributions and you were to define a new random variable as their sum, the distribution of that new random variable will still be a normal distribution and its mean will be the sum of the means of those other random variables. So the mean here, I'll say the mean of work plus home is going to be equal to 20 liters. He will use a mean of 20 liters in the roundtrip. Now for the standard deviation, from home plus work, you can't just add the standard deviations going and coming back. But because the amount of fuel going to work and the amount of fuel coming home are independent random variables, because they are independent of each other, we can add the variances. And only because they are independent can we add the variances. So what you can say is that the variance of the combined trip is equal to the variance of going to work plus the variance of going home. So what's the variance of going to work? Well, 1.5 squared is, so this will be 1.5 squared, and what's the variance coming home? Well, this is going to be two squared, two squared. Well, this is 2.25 plus four, which is equal to 6.25. So the variance on the roundtrip is equal to 6.25. If I were to take the square root of that, which is equal to 2.5, we can now describe the normal distribution of the roundtrip and use that to answer the question. So we have this normal distribution that might look something like this. We know its mean is 20 liters. So this is 20 liters. And we want to know what is the probability that Shinji runs out of fuel. Well, to run out of fuel, he would need to require more than 25 liters of fuel. So if 25 liters of fuel is right over here, so this is 25 liters of fuel, the scenario where Shinji runs out of fuel is right over here, this is where he needs more than 25 liters. He actually has 25 liters in his tank. So how do we figure out that area right over there? Well, we could use a z-table. We could say how many standard deviations above the mean is 25 liters? Well, it is five liters above the mean, so let me write this down. So the Z here, the Z is equal to 25 minus the mean, minus 20, divided by the standard deviation for, I guess you could say this combined normal distribution. This is two standard deviations above the mean or a z-score of plus two. So if we look at a z-table and we look exactly two standard deviations above the mean, that will give us this area, the cumulative area below two standard deviations above the mean. And then if we subtract that from one, we will get the area that we care about. So let's get our z-table out. We care about a z-score of exactly two, so 2.00 is right over here, .9772. So that tells us that this area right over here is 0.9772, and so that blue area, the probability that Shinji runs out of fuel is going to be one minus 0.9772, and what is that going to be equal to? Let's see, this is going to be equal to 0.0228. Did I do that right? I think I did that right. Yes, 0.0228 is the probability that Shinji runs out of fuel. If you want to think of it as a percent, 2.28% chance that he runs out of fuel.",math_statistics-probability_random-variables-stats-library
" -  Given the graph of y equals f of x pictured below, determine the equations of all vertical asymptotes. Let's see what's going on here. So it looks like interesting things are happening at x equals negative four and x equals two. At x equals negative four, as we approach it from the left the value of the function just becomes unbounded right over here. Looks like as we approach x equals negative four from the left, the value of our function goes to infinity. Likewise, as we approach x equals negative four from the right, it looks like our, the value of our function goes to infinity. So, I'd say that we definitely have a vertical asymptote at x equals negative four. Now, let's look at x equals two. As we approach x equals two from the left, the value of our function once again approaches infinity, or it becomes unbounded. Now, from the right, we have an interesting thing. If we look at the limit from the right right over here, it looks like we're approaching a finite value. As we approach x equals two from the right, it looks like we're approaching f of x is equal to negative four. But, just having a one-sided limit that is unbounded, is enough to think about this as a vertical asymptote. The function is not defined right over here, and as we approach it from just one side, we are becoming unbounded. It looks like we're approaching infinity or negative infinity, so that by itself, this unbounded left hand limit, or left-side limit by itself is enough to consider x equals two a vertical asymptote. So, we can say that there's a vertical asymptote at x equals negative four and x equals two.",math_calculus-all-old_limits-and-continuity-calc
" All right. I'm going to start out with a challenge for you. I'm going to show you a series of shapes, and I want you to count the number of yellow stars that you see. Also, count the number of red X's that pop up on the screen, so that's two separate numbers, one for how many yellow stars you see and one for how many red X's come up on the screen. All right. So that was probably a challenging task because you had to count two different things and I kept talking to you while you were trying to do that. That's an example of divided attention, which we'll talk about in just a second. But first, you probably want to see how you did. So let me show you everything you just saw. All right, this is everything that popped up on your screen. There were 15 yellow stars and 13 red X's, and also one smiley face. Don't worry it if you didn't see this guy. We'll talk about that later. But now that you have a good example of how limited a resource your attention is, let's talk more about it. When you're paying attention to something, that means that you're concentrating on it at the exclusion of the other stimuli in the environment. A lot of times, though, we try to divide our attention and do multiple things at once. So maybe you watch TV while studying, or try to count yellow stars while trying to count red X's. The thing is, as you just saw, attention is a limited resource, and we can't split it all that well when it comes to complicated stimuli. So if you're trying to do two things at once, you usually end up switching between those tasks rather than doing them simultaneously, even if you're switching so fast you can barely tell. So think back to when you had to count the yellow stars and the red X's. You couldn't really do that at the same time. You had to kind of flip back and forth. When you switch, or if you do just intend to focus on one thing at a time, you're exercising your selective attention. You can think of selective attention like a flashlight beam on some aspect of your environment. You can move the flashlight around, depending on what you want to focus on, but at any given moment, it's illuminating one particular area of interest, and everything else is just kind of dimmer. So the question is, what causes your flashlight beam to swing around and focus on one thing or another? There are two types of cues that can direct our attention, exogenous and endogenous. Exogenous cues are external to any goals we might have, meaning we don't have to tell ourselves to look for them in order for them to capture our attention. They include things like bright colors or loud noises, because you can be in the middle of a gripping conversation and have every intention on focusing on it, but a loud noise will still cause your focus to shift. And with salient visual cues, the ones that really stand out, this is called the pop-out effect. Something just pops out at us, like a yellow circle amidst a bunch of green circles. Endogenous cues, on the other hand, are more internalized and higher order, meaning they involve the internal knowledge to understand the cue in the first place, and the intention to follow it. Take an arrow, for example. If you didn't know what an arrow meant, then you wouldn't know to follow it. It's just some random lines on a piece of paper. But because you have the internal knowledge of what an arrow is, you can carry out an intention to look where it's pointing. One really good example of selective attention is the cocktail party effect, which you've probably experienced yourself multiple times. And this is your ability to attend to one voice even amidst many others. And it most commonly occurs when you hear your own name amid those voices. So, for example, picture the last time you had a big family dinner, and you're at one end of the table talking with someone, and then Grandma down at the other end of the table says your name. And even though you haven't been listening to grandma's conversation, you instantly swing your flashlight beam of attention down to hear what she's saying about you. And if you had to guess what type of cue your name was in that situation, endogenous or exogenous, what would you say? If you said endogenous, then that's right. Because it was the meaning of your name that drew your attention to when Grandma said it. All right. So now we know that different cues draw our attention to certain stimuli, whether we want them to or not. But what happens to all the stuff we're not paying attention to? Scarily enough, we experience something called an inattentional blindness, which means that we're not consciously aware of things that happen in our visual field when our attention is directed elsewhere within that field. So think back to that smiley face from our demo in the beginning. Because you were focused on yellow stars and red X's, you might have missed the smiley face, especially because he kind of blended in with the yellow stars. And that's a minor example, but inattentional blindness happens in more important situations too. For example, can you say exactly where the nearest fire extinguisher is? If you're like most people, you probably go by this every day when you're going to your home or office or wherever you are, but very few people actually pay attention to where things like fire extinguishers are, even though they're bright red and they can be necessary for our survival. Usually your attention is directed elsewhere, so you fail to notice the fire extinguisher. Closely related to inattentional blindness is change blindness, which is when we fail to notice changes in the environment. Now be careful, because the difference between change blindness and inattentional blindness is subtle but important. Inattentional blindness means that you miss something right in front of you, while change blindness means that you fail to notice a difference between a previous state and a current state, like when you don't notice when your mom gets a haircut or you get back to your room and don't notice that furniture or books are in a different place. And this is actually very common as well, so don't feel bad if it happens to you. In fact, there's one really good example when a researcher stopped people on a busy street and asked for directions. And part way through when the people were giving their directions, a large bookcase was carried between them and the researcher, and he swapped places with a different person.

" -  What we're going to do in this video is continue our journey trying to understand what the expected value and what the variance of a binomial variable is going to be or what the expected value or the variance of a binominal distribution is going to be which is just the distribution of a binomial variable. And so, like in the last video I have this binomial variable X that's defined in a very general sense. It's the number of successes from N trials, so it's a finite number of trials where the probability of success is equal to P, so the probability is constant across the trials for each of these independent trials, so the probability of success in one trial is not dependent on what happened in the other rials. And we also talked in that previous video where we talked about the expected value of this binomial variable we said hey, it could be viewed that this binomial variable can be viewed as the sum of N of what you could really consider to be a Bernoulli variable here. So, this variable, this random variable Y, the probability that's equal to one, you could do that as a success is equal to P. The probability that it's a failure that Y is equal to zero is one minus P, so you could view Y, the outcome of Y or whether Y is one or zero is really whether we had a success or not in each of these trials, so if you add up N Ys, then you are going to get X and we use that information to figure out what the expected value of X is going to be because the expected value of Y is pretty straightforward to directly compute. Expected value of Y is just the probability weighted outcomes. So, it's P times one plus one minus P, one minus P, times zero, times zero. This whole term's gonna be zero and so, the expected value of Y is really just P and so, if you said the expected value of X, well, that's just going to be, let me just write it over here, this is all review, we could say that the expected value of X is just going to be equal to, we know from our expected value properties that it's going to be equal to the sum of the expected values of these N Ys, or you could say it is N times the expected value, times the expected value of Y, the expected value of Y is P, so this is going to be equal to N times P. Now, we're gonna do the same idea to figure out what the variance of X is going to be equal to because we could see, we know from our variance properties, you can't do this with standard deviation but you could do it with variance and then once you figure out the variance, you just take the square root for the standard deviation, the variance of X is similarly going to be the sum of the variances of these N Ys. So, it's gonna be similarly N times the variance, N times the variance of Y. So, this all boils down to what is the variance of Y going to be equal be? So, let me scroll over a little bit, get a little bit of more real estate and I will figure that out right over here. Alright, so we wanna figure out the variance of Y, so variance of Y is going to be equal to what? Well, here it's going to be the probability squared distances from the expected value. So, we have a probability of P where what is going to be our squared distance from the expected value? Well, we're going to get a one with a probability of P, so in that case our distance from the mean or from the expected value, we're at one, the expected value we already know is equal to P, so that's that for that possible outcome, the squared distance times its probability weight and then we have, actually let me scroll over, well, I'll just do it right over here, plus we have a probability of one minus P, one minus P for the other possible outcome, so in that outcome we are at zero and the difference between zero and our expected value? Well, that's just going to be zero minus P and once again we are going to square that quantity and so, this is the expression for the variance of Y and we can simplify it a little bit. So, this is all going to be equal to, so, P times one minus P squared and then is just going to be P squared times one minus P plus P squared times one minus P and let's see, we can factor out a P times one minus P, so what is that going to be left with? So, if we factor out a P times one minus P here, we're just going to be left with a one minus P and if we factor out a P times one minus P here, we're just going to have a plus P. These two cancel out. This is just this whole thing is just a one. So, you're left with P times one minus P which is indeed the variance for a binomial variable. We actually proved that in other videos. I guess it doesn't hurt to see it again but there you have. We know what the variance of Y is. It is P times one minus P and the variance of X is just N times the variance of Y, so there we go, we deserve a little bit of a drum roll, the variance of X is equal to N times P times one minus P. So, if we were to take the concrete example of the last video where if I were to take 10 free throws, so each trial is a shot, is a free throw, so if I were to take 10 free throws and my probability of success is 0.3, I have a 30% free throw percentage, the variance that I would expect to see, so in that case the variance if X is the number of free throws I make after these 10 shots, my variance will be 10 times 0.3, 0.3 times one minus 0.3, so 0.7 and so, that would be what? This right over, so this would be equal to 10 times .3 times .7 times 0.21, so my variance in this situation is going to be equal to 2.1. Is equal to 2.1 and if I wanted to figure out the standard deviation of this right over here, I would just take the square root of this, so if we want the standard deviation, just take the square root of this expression right over here.",math_statistics-probability_random-variables-stats-library
" Let's say that we have the indefinite integral, and the function is 3x squared plus 2x times e to x to the third plus x squared dx. So how would we go about solving this? So first when you look at it, it seems like a really complicated integral. We have this polynomial right over here being multiplied by this exponential expression, and over here in the exponent, we essentially have another polynomial. It seems kind of crazy. And the key intuition here, the key insight is that you might want to use a technique here called u-substitution. And I'll tell you in a second how I would recognize that we have to use u-substitution. And then over time, you might even be able to do this type of thing in your head. u-substitution is essentially unwinding the chain rule. And the chain rule-- I'll go in more depth in another video, where I really talk about that intuition. But the way I would think about it is, well, I have this crazy exponent right over here. I have the x to the third plus x squared, and this thing right over here happens to be the derivative of x to the third plus x squared. The derivative of x to the third is 3x squared, derivative of x squared is 2x, which is a huge clue to me that I could use u-substitution. So what I do here is this thing, or this little expression here, where I also see its derivative being multiplied, I can set that equal to u. So I can say u is equal to x to the third plus x squared. Now, what is going to be the derivative of u with respect to x? du dx. Well, we've done this multiple times. It's going to be 3x squared plus 2x. And now we can write this in differential form. And du dx, this isn't really a fraction of the differential of du divided by differential of dx. It really is a form of notation, but it is often useful to kind of pretend that it is a fraction, and you could kind of view this if you wanted to just get a du, if you just wanted to get a differential form over here, how much does u change for a given change in x? You could multiply both sides times a dx. So both sides times a dx. And so if we were to pretend that they were fractions, and it will give you the correct differential form, you're going to be left with du is equal to 3x squared plus 2x dx. Now why is this over here? Why did I go to the trouble of doing that? Well we see we have a 3x squared plus 2x, and then it's being multiplied by a dx right over here. I could rewrite this original integral. I could rewrite this as the integral of-- and let me do it in that color-- of 3x squared plus 2x times dx times e-- let me do that in that other color-- times e to the x to the third plus x squared. Now what's interesting about this? Well the stuff that I have in magenta here is exactly equal to du. This is exactly equal to du. And then this stuff I have up here, x to the third plus x squared, that is what I set u equal to. That is going to be equal to u. So I can rewrite my entire integral, and now you might recognize why this is going to simplify things a good bit, it's going to be equal to-- and what I'm going to do is I'm going to change the order. I'm going to put the du, this entire du, I'm gonna stick it on the other side here, so it looks like more of the standard form that we're used to seeing our indefinite integrals in. So we're going to have our du times e to the u. And so what would the antiderivative of this be in terms of u? Well, the derivative of e to the u is e to the u. The antiderivative of e to the u is e to the u. So it's going to be equal to e to the u. Now, there is a possibility that there was some type of a constant factor here, so let me write that. So plus c. And now, to get it in terms of x, we just have to unsubstitute the u. We know what u is equal to, so we could say that this is going to be equal to e. Instead of writing u, we could say u is x to the third plus x squared. And then we have our plus c. And we are done. We have found the antiderivative. And I encourage you to take the derivative of this, and I think you will find yourself using the chain rule, and getting right back to what we had over here.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-antiderivatives-ftc
" I made a claim that for this sequence-- and this was in a previous video-- that for this sequence right over here that can be defined explicitly in this way, that the limit of the sequence-- and so I can write this as negative 1 to the n plus 1 over n. That's one way of defining our sequence explicitly-- the limit of this as n approaches infinity is equal to 0. And it seems that way. As n gets larger and larger and larger, even though the numerator oscillates between negative 1 and 1, it seems like it will get smaller and smaller and smaller. But I didn't prove it, and that's what I want to do in this video. In order to prove it, this is going to be true if and only if for any epsilon greater than 0, there is a capital M greater than 0 such that if lowercase n, if our index is greater than capital M, then the nth term in our sequence is going to be within epsilon of our limit, within epsilon of 0. So what does that say? That says, hey, give me-- our limit is 0. Let me do this in a new color. So our limit right over here is 0. That's our limit. So our limit right over here is-- we're saying the sequence is converging to 0. What we're saying is, give us an epsilon around 0. So let's say that this right over here is 0 plus epsilon. That is 0 plus epsilon. The way I've drawn it here looks like epsilon would be 0.5. This would be 0 minus epsilon. Let me make it a little bit neater. So this would be zero minus epsilon. So this is negative epsilon, 0 minus epsilon, 0 plus epsilon. Our limit in this case, or our claim of a limit, is 0. Now, this is saying for any epsilon, we need to find an M such that if n is greater than M, the distance between our sequence and our limit is going to be less than epsilon. So if the distance between our sequence and our limit is less than epsilon, that means that the value of our sequence for a given n is going to be within these two bounds. It's got to be in this range right over here that I'm shading above a certain n. So if I pick an n right over here, it looks like anything larger than that is going to be the case that we're going to be within those bounds. But how do we prove it? Well, let's just think about what needs to happen for this to be true. So what needs to be happen for a sub n minus 0, the absolute value of a sub n minus 0, what needs to be true for this to be less than epsilon? Well, this is another way of saying that the absolute value of a sub n has to be less than epsilon. And a sub n is just this business right here, so it's another way of saying that the absolute value of negative 1 to the n plus 1 over n has to be less than epsilon, which is another way of saying, because this negative 1 to the n plus 1, this numerator just swaps us between a negative and a positive version of 1 over n. But if you take the absolute value of it, this is always just going to be positive. So this is the same thing as 1 over n, as the absolute value of 1 over n has to be less than epsilon. Now, n is always going to be positive. n starts at 1 and goes to infinity. So this value is always going to be positive. So this is saying the same thing that 1 over n has to be less than epsilon in order for this stuff to be true. And now we can take the reciprocal of both sides. And if you take the reciprocal of both sides of an inequality, you would have that n-- if you take the reciprocal of both sides of an inequality, you swap the inequality. So for this to be true, n has to be greater than 1 over epsilon. And we essentially have proven it now. So now we've said, look, for this particular sequence, you give me any epsilon, and I'm going to set M to be 1 over epsilon. Because if n is greater than M, which is 1 over epsilon, then we know that this right over here is going to be true. That is going to be true. So the limit does definitely exist. And so over here, for this particular epsilon, it looks like we've picked 0.5 or 1/2 as our epsilon. So as long as n is greater than 1 over 1/2, which is 2, so in this case we could say, look, you gave me 1/2. My M is going to be a function of epsilon. It's going to be defined for any epsilon you give me greater than 0. So here, 1 over 1/2 is right over here. I'm going to make my M right over here. And you see it is indeed the case that my sequence is within the range as we passed for any n greater than 2. So for n is equal to 3 it's in the range. For n is equal to 4 it's in the range. For n equals 5-- and it keeps going and going. And we're not just taking our word for it. We've proven it right over here. So we've made the proof. You give me any other any epsilon, I said M is equal to 1 over that thing. And so for n greater than that, this is going to be true. So this is definitely the case. This sequence converges to 0.",math_calculus-2_cs2-series
" In the last video, we proved that the sum of all of the positive integers up to and including n can be expressed as n times n plus 1 over 2. And we proved that by induction. What I want to do in this video is show you that there's actually a simpler proof for that. But it's not by induction, so it wouldn't be included in that video. But I'll show you that it exists, just so you know that induction isn't the only way to prove it. So we define that function S of n as the sum of all of the positive integers up to and including n. So this is equal to, by definition, 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus, all the way to plus n minus 1 plus n. So it's the sum of all of the integers up to and including n. This is how we're defining it. Well, we can rewrite it again. We can say that the sum, S of n-- we could just rewrite this same thing, but we could rewrite it in a different order. We could say that this is the same thing as n plus n minus 1 plus n minus 2 plus, all the way down to plus 2 plus 1. Now, what does this do for us? Well, we can actually add these two rows. If we add S of n plus S of n, we're going to get 2 times this sum, so we're just adding on the left. And then we can also add on the right. So we're just adding this sum twice, but what's interesting is how we're going to add it. We're going to add this term to this term, this term to this term, because we're really just trying to add these two things. And we can pick any way we want to add them. So 1 plus n is going to be n plus 1. And then we're going to add-- let me do it in pink-- 2 plus n minus 1. So what's 2 plus n minus 1? Let me write it over here. 2 plus n minus 1. It's the same thing as 2 plus n minus 1, which is the same thing as n plus 1. 2 minus 1 is just 1. So this is also going to be n plus 1. And then this term over here, 3 plus n minus 2, or n minus 2 plus 3. Once again, that's going to be n plus 1. And you're going to do that for every term all the way until you get over here, n minus 1 plus 2. That's also going to be n plus 1. And then finally, you have n plus 1 right over here. Plus n plus 1. So what's this whole sum going to be? Well, how many of these n plus 1's do we have? Well, we have n of them, for every term in each of these sums. So this is 1, 2, 3, count all the way to n. You have n of these terms. So you have n n plus 1's. So if you add something to itself n times, or if you have something n times right over here, this is exactly equivalent to n times n plus 1. So 2 times that sum of all the positive integers up to and including n is going to be equal to n times n plus 1. So if you divide both sides by 2, we get an expression for the sum. So the sum of all the positive integers up to and including n is going to be equal to n times n plus 1 over 2. So here was a proof where we didn't have to use induction. It's really kind of a pure algebraic proof.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-3
" - Omojobi is 220 centimeters tall. He wanted to fill up his pool so that the water level would be as high as he is tall. So that the water level, I guess, would be 220 centimeters tall. The water level rose by six centimeters each minute and reached the desired height after 20 minutes. Graph the pool's water level, in centimeters, as a function of time, in minutes. Well, they do tell us one interesting thing. They say that the water level reached the desired height after 20 minutes. And we know what the desired height is, the desired height is to be as tall as, or to be as deep as he is tall, or as high as he is tall. And that is 220 centimeters tall. So they're telling us essentially that the water level of the pool after 20 minutes is 220 centimeters, so we can plot that. So after 20 minutes, so we can plot that point right there. After 20 minutes, we are at 220 centimeters. So we would be right there. Now the other question is where would we put this point? We need another data point in order to define a line. And so they tell us that the water, you might be tempted to say, ""Okay, maybe the water level was ""at zero to begin with,"" but they didn't tell us that. Maybe when he started filling the pool there was already some water in there. So we have to be a little bit more careful. But they do give us some information. The water level rose by six centimeters each minute, it rose by six centimeters each minute. So at 20 minutes, we know we're at 220. And if we rose six centimeters each minute, where would we have been, let's say 10 minutes ago? So, where would we have been at time 10? So, every 10 minutes, if the water level is rising six centimeters a minute, it would be rising 60 centimeters every 10 minutes. So 10 minutes ago, we would be 60 centimeters less. So 60 centimeters less than 220. That's 20 centimeters less, that's 40 centimeters less, that's 60 centimeters less. So, if you go back in time 10 minutes, you would be 60 centimeters shallower, or less high, and 220 minus 60 is 160. Now, I think I'm done. I think this describes it. Now let's see if it makes sense. This is telling us that at time zero there was, before he started filling it, there was already 100 centimeters in his pool. And then after 20 minutes, he's done. And is that consistent with six centimeters a minute? Well, based on this, it took him 20 minutes to get to 220, but that's an incremental 120. To go from 100 to 220 is 120 more centimeters. So in 20 minutes, he got 120 centimeters. Well 120 centimeters divided by 20 minutes is six centimeters per minute. So this is looking good and we got it right.",math_algebra-home_alg-linear-eq-func

" -  What I hope to do in this video is get familiar with the notion of an interval, and also think about ways that we can show an interval, or interval notation. Right over here I have a number line. Let's say I wanted to talk about the interval on the number line that goes from negative three to two. So I care about this-- Let me use a different color. Let's say I care about this interval right over here. I care about all the numbers from negative three to two. So in order to be more precise, I have to be clear. Am I including negative three and two, or am I not including negative three and two, or maybe I'm just including one of them. So if I'm including negative three and two, then I would fill them in. So this right over here, I'm filling negative three and two in, which means that negative three and two are part of this interval. And when you include the endpoints, this is called a closed interval. Closed interval. And I just showed you how I can depict it on a number line, by actually filling in the endpoints and there's multiple ways to talk about this interval mathematically. I could say that this is all of the... Let's say this number line is showing different values for x. I could say these are all of the x's that are between negative three and two. And notice, I have negative three is less than or equal to x so that's telling us that x could be equal to, that x could be equal to negative three. And then we have x is less than or equal to positive two, so that means that x could be equal to positive two, so it is a closed interval. Another way that we could depict this closed interval is we could say, okay, we're talking about the interval between, and we can use brackets because it's a closed interval, negative three and two, and once again I'm using brackets here, these brackets tell us that we include, this bracket on the left says that we include negative three, and this bracket on the right says that we include positive two in our interval. Sometimes you might see things written a little bit more math-y. You might see x is a member of the real numbers such that... And I could put these curly brackets around like this. These curly brackets say that we're talking about a set of values, and we're saying that the set of all x's that are a member of the real number, so this is just fancy math notation, it's a member of the real numbers. I'm using the Greek letter epsilon right over here. It's a member of the real numbers such that. This vertical line here means ""such that,"" negative three is less x is less than-- negative three is less than or equal to x, is less than or equal to two. I could also write it this way. I could write x is a member of the real numbers such that x is a member, such that x is a member of this closed set, I'm including the endpoints here. So these are all different ways of denoting or depicting the same interval. Let's do some more examples here. So let's-- Let me draw a number line again. So, a number line. And now let me do-- Let me just do an open interval. An open interval just so that we clearly can see the difference. Let's say that I want to talk about the values between negative one and four. Let me use a different color. So the values between negative one and four, but I don't want to include negative one and four. So this is going to be an open interval. So I'm not going to include four, and I'm not going to include negative one. Notice I have open circles here. Over here had closed circles, the closed circles told me that I included negative three and two. Now I have open circles here, so that says that I'm not, it's all the values in between negative one and four. Negative .999999 is going to be included, but negative one is not going to be included. And 3.9999999 is going to be included, but four is not going to be included. So how would we-- What would be the notation for this? Well, here we could say x is going to be a member of the real numbers such that negative one-- I'm not going to say less than or equal to because x can't be equal to negative one, so negative one is strictly less than x, is strictly less than four. Notice not less than or equal, because I can't be equal to four, four is not included. So that's one way to say it. Another way I could write it like this. x is a member of the real numbers such that x is a member of... Now the interval is from negative one to four but I'm not gonna use these brackets. These brackets say, ""Hey, let me include the endpoint,"" but I'm not going to include them, so I'm going to put the parentheses right over here. Parentheses. So this tells us that we're dealing with an open interval. This right over here, let me make it clear, this is an open interval. Now you're probably wondering, okay, in this case both endpoints were included, it's a closed interval. In this case both endpoints were excluded, it's an open interval. Can you have things that have one endpoint included and one point excluded, and the answer is absolutely. Let's see an example of that. I'll get another number line here. Another number line. And let's say that we want to-- Actually, let me do it the other way around. Let me write it first, and then I'll graph it. So let's say we're thinking about all of the x's that are a member of the real numbers such that let's say negative four is not included, is less than x, is less than or equal to negative one. So now negative one is included. So we're not going to include negative four. Negative four is strictly less than, not less than or equal to, so x can't be equal to negative four, open circle there. But x could be equal to negative one. It has to be less than or equal to negative one. It could be equal to negative one so I'm going to fill that in right over there. And it's everything in between. If I want to write it with this notation I could write x is a member of the real numbers such that x is a member of the interval, so it's going to go between negative four and negative one, but we're not including negative four. We have an open circle here so I'm gonna put a parentheses on that side, but we are including negative one. We are including negative one. So we put a bracket on that side. That right over there would be the notation. Now there's other things that you could do with interval notation. You could say, well hey, everything except for some values. Let me give another example. Let's get another example here. Let's say that we wanna talk about all the real numbers except for one. We want to include all of the real numbers. All of the real numbers except for one. Except for one, so we're gonna exclude one right over here, open circle, but it can be any other real number. So how would we denote this? Well, we could write x is a member of the real numbers such that x does not equal one. So here I'm saying x can be a member of the real numbers but x cannot be equal to one. It can be anything else, but it cannot be equal to one. And there's other ways of denoting this exact same interval. You could say x is a member of the real numbers such that x is less than one, or x is greater than one. So you could write it just like that. Or you could do something interesting. This is the one that I would use, this is the shortest and it makes it very clear. You say hey, everything except for one. But you could even do something fancy, like you could say x is a member of the real numbers such that x is a member of the set going from negative infinity to one, not including one, or x is a member of the set going from-- or a member of the interval going from one, not including one, all the way to positive, all the way to positive infinity. And when we're talking about negative infinity or positive infinity, you always put a parentheses. And the view there is you could never include everything all the way up to infinity. It needs to be at least open at that endpoint because infinity just keeps going on and on. So you always want to put a parentheses if you're talking about infinity or negative infinity. It's not really an endpoint, it keeps going on and on forever. So you use the notation for open interval, at least at that end, and notice we're not including, we're not including one either, so if x is a member of this interval or that interval, it essentially could be anything other than one. But this would have been the simplest notation to describe that.",math_math1_functions
" The equation of a circle C is x plus 3 squared plus y minus 4 squared is equal to 49. What are its center h, k and its radius r? So let's just remind ourselves what a circle is. You have some point, let's call that h, k. The circle is the set of all points that are equidistant from that point. So let's take the set of all points that are, say, r away from h, k. So let's say that this distance right over here is r, and so we want all of the set of points that are exactly r away. So all the points x comma y that are exactly r way. And so you could imagine you could rotate around and all of these points are going to be exactly r away. And I'm going to try my best to draw at least a somewhat perfect looking circle. I won't be able to do a perfect job of it, but you get a sense. All of these are exactly r away, at least if I were to draw it properly. They are r away. So how do we find an equation in terms of r and h, k, and x and y that describes all these points? Well, we know how to find the distance between two points on a coordinate plane. In fact, it comes straight out of the Pythagorean theorem. If we were to draw a vertical line right over here, that essentially is the change in the vertical axis between these two points, up here, we're at y, here we're k, so this distance is going to be y minus k. We can do the exact same thing on the horizontal axis. This x-coordinate is x while this x-coordinate is h. So this is going to be x minus h is this distance. And this is a right triangle, because by definition, we're saying, hey, we're measuring vertical distance here. We're measuring horizontal distance here, so these two things are perpendicular. And so from the Pythagorean theorem, we know that this squared plus this squared must be equal to our distance squared, and this is where the distance formula comes from. So we know that x minus h squared plus y minus k squared must be equal to r squared. This is the equation for the set-- this describes any x and y that satisfies this equation will sit on this circle. Now, with that out of the way, let's go answer their question. The equation of the circle is this thing. And this looks awfully close to what we just wrote, we just have to make sure that we don't get confused with the negatives. Remember, it has to be in the form x minus h, y minus k. So let's write it a little bit differently. Instead of x plus 3 squared, we can write that as x minus negative 3 squared. And then plus-- well this is already in the form-- plus y minus 4 squared is equal to, instead of 49, we can just call that 7 squared. And so now it becomes pretty clear that our h is negative 3-- I want to do that in the red color-- that our h is negative 3, and that our k is positive 4, and that our r is 7. So we could say h comma k is equal to negative 3 comma positive 4. Make sure to get-- you know you might say, hey, there's a negative 4 here, no. But look, it's minus k, minus 4. So k is 4. Likewise, it's minus h. You might say, hey, maybe h is a positive 3, but no you're subtracting the h. So you'd say minus negative 3, and similarly, the radius is 7.",math_algebra-home_alg-conic-sections
" -  Have you wondered why you need to breath oxygen to stay alive? How does oxygen help our bodies? And what's the connection of this oxygen with the pain that you get sometimes when you are lifting weights or when you're running, the cramps that we get? How are these things connected? The answer lies in cellular respiration. So what is this? Let me start with what it is not. Respiration reminds me of breathing. But let me tell you, respiration is not breathing, okay? Even though in our daily terms, we might associate respiration with breathing but in biology, they're two different things. So what exactly is respiration then? Well, respiration is a process in which the cells of your body, your cells, release energy, release energy from glucose. From glucose. And in our daily terms, we usually say burning calories, right? That's what we mean. Burning calories is respiration. So this is where your cells are releasing that energy from the glucose. Now, to be more clear, what does this mean? Here is how I like to think about it. So imagine this is your body. The white dots represent the glucose inside your cells. Why do you need glucose? Because glucose has energy inside of it but the energy's trapped, you can't use it now, so to release that energy, your cells carry out some chemical reactions. They break down that glucose and that's what respiration is. So respiration is where your cells break down that glucose and release this energy. Think of these yellow dots as energy. And then your body can now use that energy for all the various activities. It's that same energy that keeps your heart pumping and makes your brain work, almost everything that you do comes from that energy. And now we can answer why do we need oxygen? If we go back, these our glucose molecules, guess what? Cells need oxygen to break that glucose. So this is where oxygen comes into picture. So when we breathe oxygen, the oxygen goes to all the cells. Then the cells use oxygen to break that glucose and release energy, okay? So why do we need to breathe oxygen? Because cells, for respiration, they require oxygen to break the glucose. So let's write this down as a chemical reaction now. So what do you think are the reactants for this reaction? Well, we saw that we need glucose, so let's write that. Glucose is C6H12O6. This is the molecule of glucose and we saw that cells also require oxygen. They also need oxygen. So this is what they're taking and then what did we see? What happens? We saw that the oxygen reacts with glucose, it gets broken down and energy is released, right? So what do we get when we break glucose in the presence of oxygen? Well, we get carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the gas that we throw out of our body, we exhale that because we don't need it and we also get water. Water is useful for the body and all the cells, so water is retained and most importantly, we get energy. This is the energy that you saw in the animation. And you may have to balance this equation which I'm pretty sure you can do all by yourself but anyways, this is our equation of respiration. Now, how do you remember this? Well, here's a trick. If you look at this equation carefully, it's a little familiar. This is the reverse of photosynthesis. Remember, photosynthesis? That was where plants and all the green things will take up carbon dioxide and water and the energy from the sunlight and use it to manufacture glucose and give out oxygen, right? So respiration is the exact opposite of that. So in photosynthesis, plants trap the energy from the sun into glucose and respiration is the exact opposite. They release that energy from glucose. And we've talked a lot about how to remember the photosynthesis equation in a previous video on photosynthesis, so if you need a refresher, great idea to go back and watch that. Anyways, plants also need oxygen to release their energy. I should think plants only need carbon dioxide but they also need oxygen remember. And similarly, your cells also need oxygen to release that energy and since this is happening right now, it's that same energy that's allowing your body to function and allows you to do all the work and it's the same energy that's allowing me to walk right now by contracting and relaxing the muscles of my body. Now, since walking is slow, this energy is sufficient but what happens when I start running? Well, you can imagine as I start running, I spend this energy faster. That means these reactions now have to be carried out faster to give me more energy, right? So that requires a lot of glucose and a lot more of oxygen. Now, glucose is fine because we have a lot of glucose in our body, so there's no problem with it because I ate a lot of food. But what about oxygen? Oxygen comes from outside of our body, right? So our cells start demanding now, they say, ""We need oxygen faster, faster, faster. ""I need more oxygen faster."" And therefore the brain will say, ""Okay, okay, fine, I'll give it to you, I'll give it to you"" and brain forces you to breathe shallow, make you breathe faster, right? And that's why we do this shallow breathing. (instructor panting) Why do we do that? Because I want to get that oxygen fast and I want to release that carbon dioxide from my body very fast. And so because of the shallow breathing, because of this, the shallow breathing starts but guess what? Even that is not enough for the core cells over here. You see, the core muscles of my legs are doing the maximum amount of work in running and so the cells over there need to release a lot of energy and even with that shallow breathing, the cells are saying, ""No, this is not enough. ""I need oxygen even faster, even faster."" And the brain says, ""I can't give you ""that oxygen that faster. ""We can't breath that fast, that's not possible."" So what to do because they need that energy. So the cells now start doing at a desperate attempt of getting energy, they start conducting a different kind of respiration. They start breaking down that glucose without oxygen. So let's look at the reaction where glucose is broken down without oxygen. And so when there is lack of supply of oxygen, some of the glucose molecules get broken without oxygen and you know what we'll get? This time we'll not get this because this needs oxygen. We will get one product, lactic acid. That's what we'll get. Lactic acid and it releases some energy. Energy. And now you might see I'm writing energy very small over here. You may not be able to see that also and the reason is the energy released is very small compared to over here. Okay? And so that's why this kind of respiration definitely is not all that great but it's a desperate situation. Oxygen supply is very low and so some glucose molecules are broken this way to give that extra energy. This is what gives you that boost. Okay? And if you keep on working out, then this reaction keeps on happening and as a result, lactic acid starts getting built up in your muscles. So when I'm running, a lot of lactic acid gets built up in my legs and it's that lactic acid that makes those muscles acidic and causes that burn and causes that pain and sometimes it also causes cramps. So it's the lactic acid that does that, okay? Now of course, recent studies show what lactic acid may not be the culprit but our syllabus has not caught up with the recent studies, so in your exams, if they ask you what causes cramps in athletes, our answer is gonna be lactic acid, okay? And so now you can see your cells can break down glucose in two different ways. One by using oxygen and one without oxygen. So we need to give them names. The one where oxygen is used, we call that as aerobic respiration. So this is called aerobic and the word aerobic kind of means in the presence of air and air here refers to oxygen. And since this respiration does not involve oxygen in it, it is called anaerobic, so it's called anaerobic, without oxygen or it's also called, it's also got another name, it's called fermentation. They're both same things. Fermentation. So this needs no oxygen, that's a great thing but it builds up lactic acid and very little energy's produces. Now lastly, there is another possibility for anaerobic respiration which we, our muscles cells, our cells can't do it but some microorganisms and fungi, the most famous one is yeast, so this happens in yeast, they can also perform anaerobic respiration, meaning without oxygen, but they don't get lactic acid. So you know what they do when they break glucose? They give out carbon dioxide, so they give out carbon dioxide plus a very important product called ethanol. 1Ethanol and again, plus energy. 1If it's respiration, it has to release energy. 1Again, very tiny amounts of energy. 1You may not be able to see this 1but that's energy, okay? 1Very small compared to this. 1Now, what is this ethanol? 1Now, you learn a lot about this in chemistry 1that ethanol is a kind of an alcohol, 1there are different kinds 1and this is the one that people consume 1and so you can see that yeast has a lot 1of importance in alcohol industry 1and how do we remember this reaction now? 1Well, I like to imagine a picture 1of a bottle of beer. 1Now, we do not promote drinking or alcohol or anything 1but the picture helps to remember the fermentation of yeast. 1So they put yeast in this beer, right? 1And that's what produces the ethanol 1and the carbon dioxide produces this froth 1but a more mind-blowing example of this 1is when I learned that yeast is used in bread 1and that's what makes it fluffy. 1So when they prepare the dough of that bread, 1they add some sugar and yeast to it 1and then they let it sit for a while. 1The yeast starts breaking down that glucose from the sugar 1and causes carbon dioxide to be released from inside 1and that carbon dioxide, 1since it's a gas, it makes that dough rise. 1Then they start baking it, 1maybe by putting it in a oven 1and once you start heating it, 1the carbon dioxide gas starts expanding even more 1and eventually at a particular temperature, 1both of them start escaping from that, 1leaving behind air spaces 1and that's the air space that you see in that bread 1which makes it spongy and fluffy. 1Beautiful, right? 1And so both of these are fermentation 1or anaerobic reactions. 1This one is lactic acid fermentation 1and this one is called alcohol fermentation. 1So that's pretty much it. 1So let's summarize. 1What did we learn in this video? 1We saw that respiration in biology 1is not the same thing as breathing. 1It is process where cells release energy 1from glucose and one way of doing that 1is in the presence of oxygen 1which we call it aerobic respiration 1which gives the maximum amount of energy 1and how do we remember this? 1I remember this as the opposite 1or reverse of photosynthesis equation. 1And then we saw when there is shortage of oxygen, 1sometimes our cells can break down glucose without oxygen. 1This time we get lactic acid and little bit of energy. 1Because this is without oxygen, 1we'll call this anaerobic or fermentation 1and the way I remember this equation 1is I remember that I'm working out, 1that pain is caused, that cramps are caused by lactic acid 1even though it may not be really true, 1for the sake syllabus, we'll use this. 1And finally, some other microorganisms like yeast 1can undergo a different kinds of fermentation 1where they give us carbon dioxide and ethanol 1and again, a little bit of energy. 1And the way I remember this is I know yeast 1is used in alcohol industries 1and it's also used in bread making 1and that bread dough rises because of the carbon dioxide gas 1that gets trapped.",science_class-10-biology_in-in-life-processes
" -  We are asked, what is the slope of the line that contains these points? So pause this video and see if you can work through this on your own before we do it together. Alright, now let's do it together, and let's just remind ourselves what slope is. Slope is equal to change in y, this is the Greek letter delta, look likes a triangle, but it's shorthand for change in y over change in x. Sometimes you would see it written as y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1 where you could kind of view x1 y1 as the starting point and x2 y2 as the ending point. So let's just pick two xy pairs here, and we can actually pick any two if we can assume that this is actually describing a line. So we might as well just pick the first two. So let's say that's our starting point and that's our finishing point. So what is our change in x here? So we're going from two to three, so our change in x is equal to three minus two which is equal to one, and you can see that to go from two to three you're just adding one. And what's our change in y? Our change in y is our finishing y one minus our starting y four, which is equal to negative three. And you could of, you didn't even have to do this math, you would have been able to see to go from two to three you added one, and to go from four to one, you have to subtract three. For there we have all the information we need. What is change in y over change in x? Well, it's going to be, our change in y is negative three and our change in x is one. So our slope is negative three divided by one is negative three. Let's do another example. Here we are asked, what is the slope of the line that contains these points? So pause this video and see if you can figure it out or pause the video again and see if you can figure it out. Alright, so remember, slope is equal to change in y over change in x. And we should be able to pick any two of these pairs in order to figure that out if we assume that this is indeed a line. Well, just for variety, let's pick these middle two pairs. So what's our change in x? To go from one to five, we added four. And what's our change in y? To go from seven to 13, we added six. So our change in y is six when our change in x is four. And I got the signs right, in both case it's a positive. When x increases, y increased as well. So our slope is six fourths, and we could rewrite that if we like. Both six and four are divisible by two, so let be divide both the numerator and the denominator by two and we get three halves, and we're done.",math_algebra_linear-equations-graphs
" So I've got three lines in R2, and I want to find their intersection. So the first one is 2x minus y is equal to 2, the second one is x plus 2y is equal to 1, and the third one is x plus y is equal to 4. So let's first just graph these, just to have a visual representation of what we're trying to do. So I like writing my lines in y equals mx plus b form. So this top line becomes what? Minus y is equal to minus 2x, minus 2x plus 2. I just subtracted 2x from both sides. Or we could write that y is equal to 2x minus 2. That's the first line here. The second line-- I'm doing it in green --we could write this as 2y is equal to minus x plus 1, or we could write that y is equal to minus 1/2 x plus 1/2. I just divided both sides by 2. And this last line right here, we could write this as y is equal to minus x plus 4. Go straight here. y is equal to minus x plus 4. Now let me graph these. Let me draw an axis, that is my y-axis. I can call it my y-axis since we're actually dealing with x and y's now. I'll do it slightly lighter. I'll do it in this grey as well. I'd say that is my x-axis. Just like that. And this first guy is going to be 2x minus 2. So it's y-intercept is going to be at minus 2. It's going to have a slope of 2, so it's going to be a pretty steep line, just like that. So that's that first line, just like that. 2x minus 2. The next line is 1/2, minus 1/2, plus 1/2. So if we go plus 1/2, that's right there, and then the slope is minus 1/2. So for every 2 we go over, we go down 1. So it's going to be like that. It's actually going to be orthogonal, right? Because it's the negative inverse of this guy. So it's going to look something like that. We draw it like that, just like that. And this guy is minus x plus 4. This is 1, 2, 3, 4, and you go minus x, so for every 1 you go over, you go down 1. So this other line is going to look something like this. This other line, this last line, is going to look something like that. Just like that. Now, I said at the beginning of this video that I want to find the intersection of these three lines. But notice, there is no intersection of these three lines. They all intersect the other two, but they don't all intersect each other in one point. We can kind of call the system as being overdetermined. We've overconstrained it. There is no intersection of all three of these points. So if I were to actually try to solve this system, I would find no solution. And to say that this has no solution is equivalent to saying that this matrix, or this equation has no solutions. Let me write this. I'm just going to rewrite the system like this. This is equivalent to the matrix, let me make sure I get this right, the matrix times the vector xy is equal to 2, 1, and 4. And so, this first equation is 2 times x, minus 1 times y. So it's 2 and minus 1. 2 times x minus 1 times y is equal to 2. That's that first equation over there. The second equation-- actually I could even, well I won't color code it, that'll take forever --that's 1 times x plus 2 times y is equal to 1. And then we have x plus y is equal to 4. This system and this equation, this system right here, these are equivalent. Now, this isn't going to have any solution. You could try to find a solution to this. You could create an augmented matrix, put it in reduced row echelon form. But there is no intersection to the three things. So you're not going to find a solution to A times some vector-- we could call this some vector x --is equal to B. Or another way to say it, is that B is not in the column space of this matrix right here. Now, we learned in the last video that sure, we can't find a solution to Ax equals B. Ax equals B has no solution. We see it graphically here; these lines don't intersect with each other. And you could prove it for yourself algebraically by trying to find a solution here. You'll end up with a 0 equals 1. But we can almost get there by finding a least squares solution. And we find a least squares solution if we multiply both sides by A transpose. We know that A transpose times A times our least squares solution is going to be equal to A transpose times B. So at least we can find the closest fit for our solution. So let's find the vector x this is our least squares solution. So what is A transpose times A? A transpose looks like this, you'll have 2 minus 1, 1, 2, 1, 1. That is A transpose. And then of course A is just this thing: 2 minus 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. So A transpose A is going to be equal to-- We have a 2 by 3 times a 3 by 2 matrix, so it's going to be a 2 by 2 matrix. So it's going to be a 2 by 2 matrix. So what do we get, we get 2 times 2 which is 4, plus 1 times 1, plus 1 times 1. So it's 4 plus 1 plus 1. So that's equal to 6. And then we have 2 times minus 1, which is minus 2, plus 1 times 2, so those cancel out. Minus 2 plus 2 is 0, plus 1 times 1. That's just going to be 1. And then we get minus 1 times 2, which is minus 2, plus 2 times 1, which is 2. So the minus 2 plus 2 is 0, plus 1 times 1, so we get a 1. And then finally, we get minus 1 times minus 1, which is positive 1. Plus 2 times 2, which is 4, so we're now at 5. Plus 1 times 1, so this is going to be 6. So this is A transpose A. Now, what is A transpose times B? A transpose is 2, 1, 1, minus 1, 2, 1. And then B is just the 3 by 1 vector, the vector that's a member of R3, 2, 1, 4. So what is this going to be equal to? This is going to be equal to-- We get a 3. Sorry, this is a 2 by 3 times a 3 by 1. We're going to get a 2 by 1 vector. You get a 2 by 1 vector here. So 2 times 2 is 4, plus 1 times 1, so that's plus 1, so that's 5. Plus-- let me actually write it down, I'm going to make a careless mistake --2 times 2, which is 4, plus 1 times 1, which is 1, plus 1 times 4, which is 4. Then here, you have minus 1 times 2, which is minus 2, 2 times 1, which is 2, plus 1 times 4, which is 4. So A transpose times B is equal to 9, and this is going to be 4. So we can rewrite this guy right here as the matrix A transpose A. Which is just 6, 1, 1, 6 times my least squares solution-- so this is actually going to be in the column space of A --is equal to A transpose times B, which is just the vector 9 4. And this'll be a little bit more straightforward to find a solution for. In fact, there will be a solution. We proved it in the last video. So to find a solution, let's create our little augmented matrix: 6, 1, augmented with a 9. You have the 4 there, you get a 1 and a 6. Just like that. Let's put the left hand side in reduced row echelon form. Actually, first I'm going to swap these two rows. That's my first row operation that I choose to do, just because I like to have that 1 there. It's a nice pivot entry. So then it goes to 1, 6, 4, and 6, 1, 9. And then let me replace my second row with the second row minus 6 times the first row. So I'm going to keep my first row the same. So I have 1, 6, and 4. And then my second row, I'm going to replace my second row with a second row minus 6 times the first row. So 6 minus 6 is 0. 1 minus 6 times 6, that's 1 minus 36, so that's minus 35. And then a 9 minus 6 times 4, is 9 minus 24. This one always gets me in trouble. So 9 minus 24, that's the negative of 24 minus 9, so that is minus 15. Let me make sure I didn't make a careless mistake. 1 minus 36 is minus 35, 9 minus 24, is minus 15. So that's what I get right there. And then let me go to the right now, so let me let me divide this row right here, let me divide it by minus 35. 1So I'm going to keep my first row the same. 11, 6, and 4. 1And then this guy right here, I'm going to 1divide by minus 35. 1So I'm going to get 0, 1, and then minus 15 over minus 35. 1That's 15 over 35, or that's 3 over 7, so 1that is equal to 3/7. 1And then let me just put this in complete reduced row 1echelon form. 1That'll be nice. 1Let me keep my second row the same. 1So my second row is 0, 1, and 3/7. 1And then my first row, I'm going to replace it with my 1first row minus 6 times my second row. 1So 1 minus 6 times 0 is 1, 6 minus 6 times 1 is 0, and then 1we have 4 minus 6 times 3/7. 1So 4 is 28/7. 1Let me write it up here. 1So we have 4, which is 28/7, minus 6 times 3/7, so minus 118/7, right? 1That's 6 times 3/7. 1So this is going to be equal to 10/7. 1And just like that, I've solved this new equation. 1So you could say that-- Let me write it this way. 1We could write that x star-- This is going to the first 1entry of x star, which we could call x, 1is going to be 10/7. 1Let me write this. 1x star, the solution is going to be 10/7 and 3/7. 1So I'm saying that if you take x is equal to 10/7 and y is 1equal to 3/7, you're going to get as close to 1a solution as possible. 1Let's see what that looks like visually? 1What is 10/7? 1Let me write this down. x star is equal to 10/7 and 3/7. 1We're saying the closest-- Our least squares solution is x is 1equal to 10/7, so x is a little over one. 1And then y is going to be 3/7, a little less than 1/2. 1So our least squares solution is going to be 1this one, right there. 1And so this, when you put this value for x, when you put x is 1equal to 10/7 and y is equal to 3/7, you're going to 1minimize the collective squares of the distances 1between all of these guys. 1I drew this a little bit too small to show that. 1But let's actually figure out what our least, what our 1minimized difference is. 1Remember, the whole point of the is to minimize the 1distance between Ax star, is to minimize the distance 1between Ax star and B. 1Or between B and Ax star. 1Now, what was Ax star equal to? 1Ax star was equal to 9/4. 1So this right here. 1Sorry, Ax star, that's not equal to 9/4, that's A 1transpose Ax star is equal to 9/4. 1Ax star is our original matrix A, which is this one right 1here, so 2-- Let me write it down here. 1I know it's off the page right now. 1So our original matrix A was 2, minus 1, 1, 2, 1, 1. 1That was our original matrix A right there. 1And then our x star, we were able to 1determine, is 10/7 and 3/7. 1So Ax star is going to be this product, so what 1does it equal to? 1It is equal to, it is going to be a 3 by 1 matrix. 1So we got 2 times 10/7, which is 20/7, minus 1 times 13/7, so minus 3/7. 1And then we get, let me see, yep, that's 10 minus 3/7, and 1we have 10/7, minus 2 times 3/7, so minus 6/7. 1Or plus, sorry, this is a plus. 1Right? 12 times 10/7 is 20/7 minus 1 times 3/7, then we have 1 1times 10/7 plus 2 times 3/7. 1And then we have 10/7 plus 3/7. 1So Ax, so this is A and x star, our least squares 1approximation for x, is equal to what is this? 1This is 17/7, this is 16/7, and this is 13/7. 1We want to find out with this minimum distance is. 1So, let's see, this is going to be this thing. 1So 17/7, 16/7, and 13/7 minus our original B. 1Our original B was 2, 1, and 4. 1So I'm claiming that my solution that we just found, 1this minimizes this distance. 1Because this is the projection of B onto the 1column space of A. 1We saw that before. 1So our B we see all the way up here is 2, 1, 14, just like that. 1So if we take the length of this-- let me switch colors 1--this is equal to the length. 1Let me write all of us in sevenths-- I'll 1just do it in my head. 1I don't want to waste too much time. 1So this is 17/7 minus 14/7, right? 12 is 14/7, so this is going to be 3/7. 1Then it's 16/7 minus 7/7, so that's 9/7. 1And then we have 13/7 minus 28/7, so that is 1minus 15 over 7. 1So this is the vector that separates the B that was not 1in my column space of A from the projection of B. 1And if we find it's length, it's length is going to be 1equal to-- Let's find the square of it's length first. 1The square of its length is going to be 3/7 squared, so 1that is 9/49, plus 9/7 squared, which is 81/49, plus 1minus 15/7 squared. 1What's 15 squared? 115 squared is 225, I think. 1Let me make sure. 1I'm prone to careless mistakes. 15 times 5 is 25, 1 times 5, this is 75, and 1then I have a 150. 1Yep, 225. 1So plus 225/49. 1Which is equal to-- So 9 plus 81 is 90, and then so 225 plus 190, to get a 5, was a 315. 1So this is equal to 315/49. 1Or, if we actually wanted the difference, that's going to 1square root of this. 1So if we take just the regular distance, that's equal to the 1square root of that. 1So it's equal to the square root of 315 over 7. 1And square root of 315, it looks like that is 1simplifiable. 1Does 9 go into it? 1Looks like 9 goes into it, maybe 35 five times? 1So it would be what, 3 square roots of 35 over 7. 1So that is just a measure. 1Let me put it this way, you're not going to be able to find 1any member of R2, any values of x and y, that's going to 1give you a smaller value than this when you find the 1distance between it's solution and the solution you were 1trying to get to. 1So this, based on our least squares solution, is the best 1estimate you're going to get. x is equal to 10/7, 1y is equal to 3/7. 1A little bit right, just like that. 1Anyway, hopefully you found that useful, and you're 1starting to appreciate that the least squares solution is 1pretty useful.",math_linear-algebra_alternate-bases
" -  Find the components of vector AB. So when they're talking about the components, at least in this context, they're just talking about breaking it down into if we start at point A and we're finishing at point B, how much do we have to move in the X direction? So this is going to be essentially our change in X. And then how much do we have to move in the Y direction to go from point A to point B? So this one over here is going to be our change in X. I just wrote the Greek letter Delta for change in X. And then, the second component is going to be our change in Y. And to think about that, let's just think about what our starting and final points are, our initial and our terminal point are. So, this point right over here, point A, its coordinates are (4,4). And then point B, its coordinates are, let's see its X coordinate is (-7,-8). So let's first think about what our change in X is, and like always, I encourage you to pause the video and try to work through it on your own. Well let's see, if we're starting at four and then we are going from X equals four. That's where we're starting, to X equals negative seven. So that right over there is our change in X. And there's a couple of ways you could compute that. You could say, ""Look, we finished at negative seven. ""We started at negative four."" You take your final point or where you end up, so that's negative seven, and you subtract your initial point, minus four, which is going to be equal to negative 11. The negative tells us that we decreased in X by 11. And you could see that. If you could just visually count the squares, you could say, ""Look, if I'm going from four ""to negative seven, I have to go down four ""just to get back to X equals zero, ""and then I have to go down another seven. ""So I have to go to the left 11 spaces."" So that's negative 11. So that's my X component, negative 11. And what is my change in Y? Well I'm going from Y equals four. In fact, I'll start at this point right over here. I'm starting at Y equals four. And I'm ending up at Y is equal to, let me do that in that other color. So, I'm starting at Y is equal to four, and I'm ending up at Y is equal to negative eight. So our change in Y, our change in Y, what's going to be my final Y value, which is negative eight, minus my initial Y value, which is four, minus four, which is equal to negative 12. So negative 12. And you could see that here. If I'm starting up here, I have to go four down just to get back to the X axis. Then I have to go down another eight, so I have to go down a total of 12. And you can see something interesting that I've just set up here. You could also view this bigger vector. Vector AB is being constructed of this X, this vector that goes purely in the X direction, and this vector that goes purely in the Y direction. If you were to add this red vector to this blue-green, dark blue-green vector, you would get vector AB, but we'll talk more about that in future videos.",math_precalculus_vectors
" - The two-way table of column relative frequencies below shows data on gender and voting preferences during the 2012 United States presidential election. They give us all this data. They give us this, as they say, the two-way table of column relative frequencies. So for example this column right over here is Men. The column total is 1.00, or you could say 100 percent. And we can see that 0.42 of the Men or 42 percent of the Men voted for Obama. We can see 52% of the Men or 0.52 of the Men voted for Romney. And we can see that the Other, neither Obama, 6 percent went for neither Obama nor Romney. And for Women, 52 percent went for Obama, 43 percent went for Romney and 5 percent went for Other. And then these, this 52 plus 43 plus 5 will add up to 100 percent of the women. During the 2012 United States presidential election, were male voters more likely to vote for Romney than female voters? So let's see. If we, there are a couple of ways you could think about it. Well, actually, let's go this way. Male voters, if you were a man, 52 percent of them voted for Romney. While for the Women, 43 percent of them voted for Romney. So a man was more likely. If you randomly picked a man who voted, there was a 52 percent chance they voted for Romney, while if you randomly picked a woman, there was a 43 percent, of women who voted, there was a 43 percent chance that she voted for Romney. So yes, male voters were more likely to vote for Romney than female voters. So the answer is Yes. And we're done.",math_engageny-alg-1_alg1-2
" SALMAN KHAN: This is Sal here. And I have Dr. David Agus visiting the office. And I want you to introduce yourself because you have kind of an interesting life. DAVID AGUS: Interesting life is scary. But I'm a professor of medicine and engineering at the University of Southern California. I treat cancer patients. And I have a lab that looks at new ways and technologies to understand and treat cancer. SALMAN KHAN: And that's what's really interesting, the fact that you're a professor of both medicine and engineering. And I guess that's kind of what we're going to touch on a little bit here. DAVID AGUS: Yeah. SALMAN KHAN: And so this is clearly a picture of eggs. Why are we looking at eggs? DAVID AGUS: Well, if I gave you those eggs, and I put them in your office, and I say come back in three weeks, what would you have? SALMAN KHAN: They would go bad. I'm not putting them in a fridge, I'm assuming. I'm just-- DAVID AGUS: You'd have a rotten egg. Exactly. But if I was clever and I changed the temperature in your office to 99.5% degrees Fahrenheit and I rotated those eggs three times, it has to be an odd number, then at the end of three weeks, I'd have a chicken. SALMAN KHAN: So that's what this other picture is. You'd have this. So you could either have a rotten egg, so this kind of crazy mess, smelly thing, or you have this cute, adorable chicken. DAVID AGUS: Although they call babies, chicks. SALMAN KHAN: Chicks, or chick. Yes. DAVID AGUS: Yes. So a small change in temperature and gravity goes from chaos to order. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. DAVID AGUS: And so we're going to talk in a minute about cancer and all the chaos that's involved with it. But realize that that egg, I changed the temperature and the gravity and I went from chaos to order. So while will it seem incomprehensible and unable to model cancer, you're going to start to see little changes can have a major effects. SALMAN KHAN: I see. And this is what's a little bit unintuitive. So when think about things like cancer, I mean cancer is not the only one, we imagine that we just have to kind of-- we have to kill it or we just have to kind of have to take it out. But what are saying is, hey, maybe there's these subtle things, analogous to rotating an egg three times and getting the temperature just right, that can make it automatically do different things. DAVID AGUS: Exactly. To me, cancer is a verb, not a noun. So you're ""cancering""-- SALMAN KHAN: Cancering. DAVID AGUS: --when you have cancer. It's not that you have cancer, you're cancering. And so my goal is to change your state of your body from a cancering to a healthing. And so the first question is how do you quantity the state? How do we say who and what you are? And so technology is giving us the opportunity to do that as we go forward. SALMAN KHAN: Right. I just want to get my head around that because you never hear that word ""cancering."" I think you probably invented that word, [INAUDIBLE], or healthing. Once again, when I imagine cancer, I think this is the way most researchers think about cancers, is the set of cells that have just gone berserk. And you have to remove them or kill them somehow or stop them from spreading. And what you're saying is, no, there's something going on systemically in your body that is cancering. It's allowing the cancer to thrive. DAVID AGUS: That's it. So your first definition of something you have to cut out, a different organism, that's bacteria. SALMAN KHAN: Right. DAVID AGUS: That's an infection. So if something from the outside comes inside of you, I give you the right antibiotic, it doesn't care if you're a man or a woman, you're six feet or you're three feet, if that antibiotic targets the bacteria, it goes away. The difference in cancer, it's your own cells that have gone a little bit crazy. And so we have to change the interaction of the body and the cells in order to make that patient better. Very different than something without, this is within. SALMAN KHAN: I see. In other words, I'm just-- it's fascinating because there's all sorts of parallels in, I guess, everyday life, depending on what you believe. But some people, if there's crime in an area, there's one point of view that you need to police it. You have to arrest all the criminals. But then, hey, maybe the criminals keep coming because there's certain environmental factors. Maybe there's just a lot of poverty and there's lack of education. And so you're saying, hey, let's look at the things systemically, as opposed to just-- DAVID AGUS: Hunting. Put some lights in the area, put some police driving by. But all of a sudden, the crime level goes down. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. It's not just about arresting the criminals. DAVID AGUS: Exactly. SALMAN KHAN: It's about preventing the crime. DAVID AGUS: Let me tell you about a clinical trial that was done a couple years. It's the coolest clinical trial. And they took women after optimal therapy for breast cancer, these they were women who were premenopausal, so really aggressive breast cancer. Half of them, after treatment, got placebo. And half of them got a drug that builds bone. SALMAN KHAN: Interesting [INAUDIBLE]. Let me write this down. So this is breast cancer. So these are people-- DAVID AGUS: These are young women with breast cancer. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. And half got a placebo, which means just like a sugar pill. DAVID AGUS: Sugar pill. SALMAN KHAN: And then you give that to patients just to make them think that they might-- because sometimes the psychological impact [INAUDIBLE]. DAVID AGUS: And this was ethical. And it's very important to talk about whether it was ethical or not. It was ethical because they already got their treatment for breast cancer. And normally in those women, we just wait. And hopefully, they're cured. And we see if it may recur. SALMAN KHAN: Right. DAVID AGUS: So in those women, we divided them into half. And we gave this pill. It was a placebo. And half, we give a drug for osteoporosis that builds bone. SALMAN KHAN: Osteoporosis, osteo-- DAVID AGUS: You say, why are you wasting someone with breast cancer's time by giving them a drug that targets bone. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. Right. DAVID AGUS: The reason is breast cancer metastasizes to bone. SALMAN KHAN: And it metastasizes, it spreads to bone. DAVID AGUS: It spreads to bone. SALMAN KHAN: And that's when cancer just goes, [INAUDIBLE]. DAVID AGUS: Right. It goes to the bone. It likes the bone. So the argument, if I change the soil, the seed won't grow. Because remember, when you have a garden, you can give your fertilizer or make that soil so those tomato plants love it. SALMAN KHAN: Right, right, right. DAVID AGUS: And so that's what we're doing here. We're making the bone different. SALMAN KHAN: Right. And so once again, the system thinking is that before, if you have these breast cancer cells that are just growing, the view is, hey, let's irradiate them. Let's slice them out. Let's get chemicals that will be toxic to these cells and kill them. What you're saying is cancer really starts to become a real negative once it spreads. And what you're saying is let's keep it from spreading maybe where it's the most common to spread, which is in the bone. So before the bone drug, the cancer spread. The cancer could kind of take root in the bone and then start spreading and metastasizing. This is what metastasis is. DAVID AGUS: Um-huh. SALMAN KHAN: And instead, you're saying maybe if you have this special drugs, this osteoporosis drug, it makes the bone that much stronger and less susceptible to this type of thing. And then that won't be able to happen. DAVID AGUS: Exactly. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. Fascinating. DAVID AGUS: So at the end of that trial, the cancer recurrence was reduced by 40%. SALMAN KHAN: Wow. DAVID AGUS: At the end of that trial, new breast cancer, so a separate breast cancer-- because once you have one breast cancer, you can get another breast cancer-- that was down by 35%, SALMAN KHAN: Wow. DAVID AGUS: So this notion of changing the system-- because remember, this is a drug that didn't even touch the breast cancer-- had a dramatic effect in the survival of these young women. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. DAVID AGUS: So again, it just makes this a whole new way of thinking about disease. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. So if we were putting words on things, the way that most people think about disease right now, you call it kind of a reductionist, where they're just going to focus on one narrow part of it. They're trying to focus on this thing right over here. And you're advocating for kind of a more systemic way of thinking about it, where you think about everything that this might involve or that might affect it. DAVID AGUS: It's so wild is that for the last several decades, we're trying to focus on the individual cell, and then the individual gene, and then the piece of the gene. And we forgot to take that step back and look at the whole system. And so remember, the cancer is your normal cell that's gone a little bit crazy. So we have to model that whole system and figure out a way to control it so the cancer won't like it. SALMAN KHAN: Wow. Fascinating. Fascinating. And then we have pictures of what some of these things look like. So what is this right over here? DAVID AGUS: So this is a liver that's taken out of a patient. And the white spots there are colon cancer that's metathesizes, again spread to the liver. SALMAN KHAN: Right. So it's a cancer that grew up in the colon. And at some point, it was able to spread and kind of liberate itself and then attach on to the liver. And it's metastasized to the liver. And now, it's kind of growing in this-- it looks, at least from this picture, kind of a cauliflower-like shape. DAVID AGUS: Exactly. Exactly. And then if I showed this to a surgeon, or someone who normally operates on livers, they would know right away, hey, that looks like colon cancer gone to liver. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. SALMAN KHAN: And if you look at the next picture on the right, that's colon cancer inside of a lymph node under a microscope. SALMAN KHAN: And these are the lymph? DAVID AGUS: Those are the normal lymphs. SALMAN KHAN: Lymphs. And this right here is the colon cancer? DAVID AGUS: Exactly. SALMAN KHAN: OK. DAVID AGUS: And so any pathologist would look under a microscope and they would make a diagnosis and say, hey, this looks like colon cancer gone to the lymph. And in the bottom is a different way of looking at cancer, which is a CAT scan. So this is basically a three-dimensional X-ray. I took a slice right in the middle that person's body and those translucent areas in the middle there are colon cancer metastasis. SALMAN KHAN: This? DAVID AGUS: Those darker areas, yes. SALMAN KHAN: OK. DAVID AGUS: And so what's amazing is-- SALMAN KHAN: That's in their liver. DAVID AGUS: Colon cancer looks a certain way, in a lymph node, in the liver, on a CAT scan. And it always looks that way. The body doesn't care what the underlying genetics are because the genetics are dramatically different patient, to patient, to patient. But it always looks the same. SALMAN KHAN: I see. DAVID AGUS: So somehow, evolution is selecting out for phenotype, which is what things look like, not necessarily for genotype. SALMAN KHAN: Which is their actual-- the DNA that makes up what they are. DAVID AGUS: Exactly. And so we're focusing on genotype. And genotype is very important and it's going to give us some understanding over time. But we have to also take that step back and look at the phenotype, and look at what it looks like, and try to change those interactions. Remember, if a patient has early cancer, we've learned a lot in the last 10 years. So if you have early cancer, and I cure you with surgery, the day before surgery I can always find cancer cells in the blood,-- SALMAN KHAN: Wow. DAVID AGUS: --even though you were cured. So the old days, we thought, well, you have to wait till it goes out through our bloodstream and gets out there. That's wrong. It's can it live outside that original organ? SALMAN KHAN: I see. So there's someone who's cured or they're not cancering right now. And there is actually cancer in their blood. But because they're healthy now, or healthier, or they're healhing, or I guess however you want to call it, 1that cancer isn't able to take hold. 1DAVID AGUS: And those cells, they 1can't live anywhere but the colon. 1SALMAN KHAN: Fascinating. 1DAVID AGUS: So listen to this experiment. 1This is the wildest experiment. 1They took a mouse. 1And they took breast cancer and they put it 1in the left breast and the right breast. 1And they colored them red and green, the cells. 1They waited a day, they went back, 1and the cells were half red, half green; half red, 1half green. 1Because we always thought if cancer 1is something in one local spot, it really 1is a disease that keep going through the bloodstream. 1And it likes those breasts. 1That's why it keeps going back there. 1SALMAN KHAN: So interesting. 1And when I always think of metastases, 1and I can never say is the word, I always 1imagine it, OK, that's the cancer that's 1finally gotten to the lymph network. 1It's finally gotten to the blood vessels and now it's spreading 1But you're saying that there's actually often 1cancer that has gotten to the transportation 1networks of the body. 1But it has still not metastasized 1because it's not able to take hold yet. 1DAVID AGUS: Exactly. 1SALMAN KHAN: That's fascinating. 1DAVID AGUS: Exactly. 1And over time, we're going to get the technology 1to interrogate those cells to say, hey, this one 1can take hold here. 1Therefore, I have to change where it would take hold. 1We're just at the beginning of that technology that's 1going to change everything. 1SALMAN KHAN: And the reason why we're 1looking at these, the fact that colon cancer 1starts in the colon and this is how it looks when it spreads 1to different parts of the body, what you're saying 1is that we shouldn't maybe be so fixated on just 1the DNA of colon cancer because it 1can be very different from one patient to the next. 1But maybe on kind of its macrobehavior, 1it's phenotype, how it looks, and how behaves. 1And that way, it'll give us clues 1maybe on how we can change it. 1DAVID AGUS: Exactly. 1SALMAN KHAN: Fascinating. 1Thanks a bunch. 1This is very interesting. 1DAVID AGUS: It's great.",science_health-and-medicine_healthcare-misc
"  It took 20 minutes before Jughead noticed that his hot tub had sprung a leak. Once he realized it, he opened the hot tub's drain and the rest of the water rushed out in 40 minutes. The rate at which the water drained from the hot tub in gallons per minute is shown. How many gallons of water were in the hot tub before it started to leak? So let's see what they have over here. So they've plotted gallons per minute versus time in minutes. So we see here, this blue line, this is the rate at which water drained from the hot tub. So at minute zero, the water wasn't really draining from the hot tub and then not just more drained but the rate at which the water was draining increased. So 10 minutes into his bath, the water was draining at a gallon per minute and then 20 minutes into his bath water was draining at two gallons per minute. Then he noticed it and he opens the drain. I guess he wants to accelerate the end of his bath. So he opens the drain and then all of a sudden water starts draining out at a much higher rate, at 20 gallons per minute, but then that decreases. So we could think about physically why that might decrease. Maybe there was just less pressure or whatever. We're not going to go into the physics of it, but we're just going to take this chart as fact. The rate at which the water drains decreases all the way to the 60th minute, which is 40 minutes after he opened the drain. At the 60th minute, all of the water was actually drained out. So given that, how do we think about how many gallons of water were in the hot tub before it started to leak? And I encourage you to pause the video and try to see if you could figure it out yourself before I work through it. Well, to answer this question: How many gallons of water were in the hot tub before it started to leak? That is answering the same question as How much total hot water drained out? So how much drained out? And to think about that, we can just kind of go back to what we knew before we learned about calculus. If I have something happening at a fixed rate, so let's say that this is gallons per minute. So this is still the same context, I guess you could say. This is time in minutes. Let's say things are draining out at a constant rate. If you wanted to figure out how much drains out over a certain interval of time, let's say this interval of time right over here, let's call that delta t, you would just multiply the rate over that interval of time, which we could represent by this orange height right over here, times the amount of time that passed by, which would give you the area under the curve over that interval. the area under the curve over that interval. This area would tell you the gallons that drained over that delta t. And this doesn't just apply when you have a constant rate. If your rate looked something like this, as we've seen in other videos, you could figure out the amount that has drained in a specific interval, let's say this interval right over here, by essentially figuring out the area under the curve over that interval, and the units work out. If you multiply gallons per minute times minute, this area is going to be in terms of gallons. Another way you could think about it, and this goes back to, well, how do you figure out the area of a trapezoid right over here. Well, the area of a trapezoid, you could find the average height of the trapezoid, which would be the average of the beginning and the end period, you take that average over there, and this would work for a line like this, if you take that average height and multiply by the change in time, you are going to figure out that area. And that is another way of thinking about it. You are taking the average rate over that interval times the interval, and that is going to give you the total number of gallons. And so we just have to apply that idea over here. We just have to literally figure out the area under the curve over the entire interval when the water was actually leaking or draining. So essentially the area under the curve between zero minutes and 60 minutes. And so it is going to be this area plus all of this area under this part as well. To help us think about that, I'm going to just split that up into some sections. So I'll have this triangular section up here. I could just think about this as a trapezoid, but I'm just going to split it up into a triangle and a rectangle. And then I have this section right over here in green. So what is the area of this entire thing? Well, the area right over here, we have 20 minutes times two gallons per minute times 1/2. This gives us the area under this triangle. So that's going to be 20 gallons. We see that the units work out nicely. So that is essentially how much has drained out in the first 20 minutes. And then this green area is going to be 40 minutes times 10 gallons per minute. And actually maybe you know the units, since I'm breaking it up in this strange way, I'll just figure out this area in a unit-less way. So 40 times 10, which is equal to 400. And then, finally, in blue, I have 40 times this height right over here between 10 and 20 is another 10 but then I'm going to multiply that times 1/2. So it's going to be 40 times 10 times 1/2, which is going to be 200. And so when you add all of these areas together, you are going to get 400 plus 200 is 600 plus 20. You are going to have 620 gallons. 620 gallons is how much water in total drained out or how much water was in the tub before it started to leak, or the hot tub, yeah this is quite big for a regular tub, bu this could be like a Jacuzzi or a hot tub or something.",math_integral-calculus_ic-integration
" -  Let's say we have a linear equation and we know when X is equal to four that Y is equal to nine and we've plotted that point here on our XY plane. Actually, I forgot to label the x-axis right over there. Now let's say we also know, we also know that when X is equal to six Y is equal to one. And we've plotted that point there. And so this green line represents all of the solutions to this linear equation. Now what I want to do in this video is I want to say, well can we find that linear equation and can we express it in both point-slope form and in slope-intercept form. And I encourage you, like always, pause the video and see if you can do it. So let's first think about point-slope form. Point, point-slope form. And point-slope form is very easy to generate if you know a point on the line, or if you know a point that satisfies, where the X and Y coordinates satisfy the linear equation, and if you were to know the slope of the line that represents the solution set of that linear equation. Now for sure we actually were given two points that are solutions, that represent solutions to the linear equation. To fully apply point-slope, or to apply point-slope easily, we just have to figure out the slope. And what we could do is, we could just evaluate well what's the slope between the two points that we know? And we just have to remind ourselves that slope, slope, is equal to, slope is equal to change in y over change in x. Sometimes people say rise over run. And what's that going to be? Well, if we say that this second point right over here, if we say this is kind of our, if we're starting at this point and we go to that point, then our change in Y, going from this point to that point is going to be, it's going to be equal to one minus, one minus nine. One minus nine. This point right over here is the point six comma one. So we started at Y equals nine, we finish at Y equals one, our change in Y is going to be one minus nine. We have a negative eight change in Y, which makes sense. We've gone down eight. So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to negative eight. That's our change in Y. And what's our change in X? Well we go from X equals four to X equals six. So we end up at X equals six and we started at X equals four. We started at X equals four, so our change in X is six minus four, which is equal to two. Which is equal to two. And you could have even done it visually. To go from this point to this point your change in Y, your change in Y is you went down eight. So your change in, let me write this. So your change in Y is equal to negative eight. And what was your change in X? Again to get to this point? Well, your change in X is positive two. So your change in X is equal to two. And so what's your slope? Change in Y over change in X. Negative eight over two is equal to negative four. So now that we have a, now that we know the slope and we know a point, we know a, we actually know two points on the line, we can express this in point-slope form. And so let's do that. And the way I like to it is I always like to just take it straight from the definition of what slope is. We know that the slope between any two points on this line is going to be negative four. So if we take an arbitrary Y that sits on this line and if we find the difference between that Y and, let's focus on this point up here. So if we find the difference between that Y and this Y, and nine, and it's over the difference between some X on the line and this X, and four. This is going to be the slope between any XY on this line and this point right over here. And the slope between any two points on a line are going to have to be constant. So this is going to be equal to the slope of the line. It's going to be equal to negative four. And we're not in point-slope form or classic point-slope form just yet. To do that, we just multiply both sides times X minus four. So we get Y minus 9, we get Y minus nine is equal to our slope, negative four times X minus four. Time X minus four. And this right over here is our classic, this right over here is our classic point-slope form. We have the point, sometimes they even put parenthesis like this, but we could figure out the point from this point-slope form. The point that sits on this line with things that make both sides of this equation equal to zero. So it would be X equals four, Y equals nine, which we have right up there, and then the slope is right over here, it's negative four. Now from this can we now express this linear equation in y-intercept form? And y-intercept form, just as a bit of a reminder, it's Y is equal to MX plus B. Where this coefficient is our slope and this constant right over here allows us to figure out our y-intercept. And to get this in this form we just have to simplify a little bit of this algebra. So you have Y minus nine. Y minus nine is equal to, well let's distribute this negative four. And I'll just switch some colors. Let's distribute this negative four. Negative four times X is negative four X. Negative four time negative four is plus 16. And now, if we just want to isolate the Y on the left hand side, we can add nine to both sides. So let's do that. Let's add nine, let's add nine to both sides. Let's add nine to both sides. On the left-hand side we're just left with Y. And on the right-hand side we're left with negative four X and then 16 plus nine is plus 25. And there you have it. We have the same linear equation, but it's now represented in slope-intercept form. Once again, we see the slope right over here and now we can figure out what the y-intercept is. The y-intercept when X is equal to zero, Y is going to be equal to 25. My axis right here, I haven't drawn it high enough, but if I made it even taller and taller and you see this line is gonna intersect the y-axis when Y is equal to, Y is equal to 25. So there you go, we wrote it in point-slope form, that is that right over there, and we wrote it in Y, sorry, we wrote it in slope, we wrote it in slope-intercept form. Point-slope and slope-intercept. Hopefully you enjoyed that.",math_in-in-grade-11-ncert_in-in-class11-straight-lines
" -  What we have here are two different visualizations of a country's output at different points in time. You might recognize here on the left we have our production possibilities curve for this country. And it's a very simple country that either produces forks and/or spoons. So if it could produce all forks efficiently it would be right here, that many forks. If it could produce all spoons efficiently it would be right here. And all the combinations of forks and spoons that it would produce efficiently at its potential, well that's what defines this production possibilities curve. On the right here we have this country's real GDP versus time. And so you could view their real GDP as some way of computing their aggregate production of spoons and forks. Now we know that real economies do a lot more than just produce two goods. They produce millions of goods and services, but then you would need a graph that would have millions of dimensions which is very hard for most of our brains to understand. But what we have here is, thinking about three different scenarios at three different times for this country. Now we're gonna connect the dots between the visualization on the left, the production possibilities curve, and the visualization on the right. And we're also gonna think about other economic indicators other than real GDP and how those might play out. So let's start off at time T sub one right over here. From what we know of production possibility curves, what is going on in the economy? Pause this video and try to think about that. Well we know that if you're on your production possibilities curve, you're operating at your potential. But here we have a situation where we are operating beyond our potential. This is not a sustainable situation. This is a situation where some people would argue the economy is overheating. This is like if on your personal life if you're pulling all nighters in order to study for a test, that is not a sustainable situation. But at T sub one when you're operating above your potential, it is associated with low unemployment and many would argue unsustainably low unemployment. And because there's so much demand for labor, There's so much demand for utilization of other resources that that could increase price pressure. So it's also associated with higher inflation. Now what would time T sub one, what could that be on this graph here? Well I already depicted it. It could be this point right over here, where our real GDP is above this horizontal red line which you could view as our potential GDP, our full employment GDP, our full employment output. And so this shows that we have a positive output gap just as when we're above or beyond our PPC that is also a positive output gap. Now sometimes we associate this positive output gap being performing beyond the potential as being associated with an expansion versus a recession. And it is indeed the case that this T sub one is happening during an expansion. An expansion is a situation where the GDP is growing. So this is an expansion here. And then if we go from the next trough to the next peak, this is an expansion here. And the opposite of an expansion is a recession, so this is a recession where we're going from a peak to a trough. And if we go from the next peak to the next trough that also would be a recession. So this positive output gap is happening during an expansion. But you could have a situation where you're right here where you have a positive output gap, where you're operating beyond your potential, but the economy has started to shrink. So it's not always the case. Even though positive output gaps get associated with expansions, it's not always during an expansion. But anyway, let's move forward in time. Let's say for various reasons our economy slows down a bit and we go to time T sub two. Now we are actually operating at potential. We are at our productions possibility curve. And so at what point could that be on this graph? Well we have it depicted right here at time T sub two. The country is operating exactly at its potential. The country is operating efficiently in a sustainable way. And then we go to time T sub three. So at time T sub three it's clear that we have a negative output gap and you can see it over here as well. We have a negative output gap. And if you think about the economic indicators other than real GDP what will they be doing? This is a situation where an economy is operating below full employment where the unemployment rate could be elevated, or it's typically elevated when you have this negative output gap. And because both the labor and oftentimes other resources aren't being fully utilized, there might not be a lot of price pressure. So in this situation inflation would be lower. And in extreme cases you could even have negative inflation, which we would call deflation. Now associated with all of these ideas is the idea of economic growth. So in everyday language when people talk about economic growth, they're usually talking about expansions. They're talking about situations where real GDP is growing. But economists, when they talk about economic growth do not mean that. To an economist, economic growth is when the potential of an economy increases. And we know that the only way that the potential of an economy increases is if they all of a sudden have more factors of production, better resources, better technology, the population has increased. So economic growth would be associated with pushing out the actual PPC. So this would, if you saw now they had more technology or more people now, so now that would push out the PBC. And economic growth, for example, if this red line, which is the country's potential, were to increase like this, that would be economic growth. The actual real GDP at any given time would likely cycle around that.",economics-finance-domain_ap-macroeconomics_economic-iondicators-and-the-business-cycle
" - So, check out this problem. You've got a 12 kilogram mass sitting on a table, and on the left hand side it's tied to a rope that passes over a pulley and that rope gets tied to a three kilogram mass. And then on the right side of this 12 kilogram box, you've got another rope and that rope passes over another pulley on the right and is tied to the five kilogram box over here. The question is, what's the acceleration of the 12 kilogram box? Let's make it even harder. Let's say there's a coefficient of kinetic friction between this 12 kilogram box and the table of 0.1. Now you're looking at a really hard problem if you try to solve this the hard way. And by the hard way, I mean using Newton's second law for each box individually and then trying to solve what'd you end up with is at least three equations and three unknowns because you're gonna have three different accelerations. For each of these, you'll have two different tensions cause this left rope is under a different tension from the right rope now. It's only when you have a single rope can you say that it's the same tension. This problem's gonna be hard. There's gonna be tons of Algebra mistakes potentially. And so to avoid that, we can solve this the easy way. And if you remember, the easy way is just by saying, well, let's treat all of these boxes as if they're a single object. And we can do that cause they're all gonna have the same magnitude of acceleration that I'm just calling a system. That's gonna be the magnitude of acceleration of our system. All these boxes will accelerate with the same magnitude. Some may have negative accelerations, some may have positive accelerations like these, but they're gonna all have the same magnitude of acceleration cause we're gonna assume that these ropes don't break. And if they broke, then they'll be different magnitudes or if they stretch, but we're assuming that doesn't happen. And the way we can find this is by just saying, well, if this is just a single object, I don't have to worry about any internal forces, now these tensions become internal forces. And those don't make a system accelerate, only external forces are gonna make a system accelerate. So, all I have to do is find out what are all the external forces that try to make this system go, try to accelerate it, and ones that try to prevent acceleration. I'll call this F external and then I divide by the total mass because this is just simply Newton's second law as if this were one big object. So, what are my external forces? Well, the force that makes it go is gonna be this five kilogram's force of gravity so I'm gonna have a force of gravity over here. That tries to propel the system forward. This is the one that's gonna be driving the system. If I let go of these boxes, it's gonna start shifting in this direction because this five kilogram mass has a larger force of gravity than this three kilogram mass. So, I'm gonna include that as a positive. I'm just gonna define direction of motion as positive, 'cause it's easy. You could do it differently if you wanted to. You could find the other way as positive. So five times 9.8 meters per second squared is how you find this force of gravity. Are there any other forces that are propelling this forward? No, no external forces are. So, are there any forces that are trying to reduce the acceleration? Yeah, there's this force of gravity over here. This force of gravity on the three kilogram mass is trying to prevent the acceleration because it's pointing opposite the direction of motion. The motion of this system is upright and down across this direction but this force is pointing opposite that direction. This force of gravity right here. So, I'm gonna have to subtract three kilograms times 9.8 meters per second squared. Am I gonna have any other forces that try to prevent the system from moving? You might think the force of gravity on this 12 kilogram box, but look, that doesn't really, in and of itself, prevent the system from moving or not moving. That's perpendicular to this direction. I've called the direction of motion, this positive direction. If it were a force this way, if it were a force this way or a force that way it'd try to cause acceleration of the system. This force of gravity just gets negated by the normal force, so I don't even have to worry about that force. So, are there any forces associated with the 12 kilogram box that try to prevent motion? It turns out there is. There is going to be a force of friction between the table because there's this coefficient of kinetic friction. So, I've got a force this way, this kinetic frictional force, that's gonna be, have a size of Mu K times f n. That's how you find the normal force and so this is gonna be minus, the Mu K is 0.1 and the normal force will be the normal force for this 12 kilogram mass. So, I'll use 12 kilograms times 9.8 meters per second squared. You might object, you might say, ""Hey, hold on, 12 times 9.8, that's the force of gravity. ""Why are you using this force? ""I thought you said we didn't use it?"" Well, we don't use this force by itself, but it turns out this force of friction depends on this force. So, we're really using a horizontal force, a force that tries to prevent motion, which is why we've got this negative sign here, but it's a horizontal force. It just so happens that this horizontal force depends on a vertical force, which is the normal force. And so that's why we're multiplying by this .1 that turns this vertical force, which is not propelling the system, or trying to stop it, into a horizontal force which is trying to reduce the acceleration of the system. That's why I subtracted and then I divide by the total mass and my total mass is gonna be three plus 12 plus five is gonna be 20 kilograms. Now, I can just solve. If I solve this, I'll get that the acceleration of this system is gonna be 0.392 meters per second squared. So, this is a very fast way. Look it, this is basically a one-liner. If you could put this together right, it's a one-liner. There's much less chance for error than when you're trying to solve three equations with three unknowns. This is beautiful. When you apply this though, be careful. The acceleration of the five kilogram mass would be negative 0.392 because it's accelerating downward. The acceleration of the 12, we'd call positive 0.392 because it's accelerating to the right and we typically call rightward accelerations positive. And then the three kilogram mass also would have positive .392 because it's accelerating upward.",science_physics_forces-newtons-laws
" -  Let's see if we can find the area of this parallelogram, and I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can figure it out on your own. Well, we just have to remind ourselves that the area of a parallelogram is just going to be the base -- let me do this in different colors -- it's going to be the base of the parallelogram, so I want to do that in a different color, so let me write: the base of the parallelogram times the height of the parallelogram, times the height of the parallelogram. Area is equal to base times height. So, what could we consider to be the base of this parallelogram? Well, we could imagine it to be one of these sides. So, we could go from here, and so, I could say... well, I could consider this to be the base. So, what's the length of that base? Well, we're just going in the vertical direction. We go from ""y"" equals five, to ""y"" is equal to negative seven, so this has length 12. We have five above the x-axis, and seven below the x-axis, adding up to 12. Or, you could count it: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. So, this is our base, and we could say that base is equal to 12. And, now, what could we view as our height? Well, we could view this dimension, right over here, as our height. And, what is that going to be? Well, you can see very clearly that the height is equal to four. And, it might be a little counter-intuitive, 'cause normally, when you're talking about height, you're used to thinking about how high something is, but you could imagine rotating this around so that the base is laying flat, and then the height is the height, in the traditional sense of the word. But, we could say ""h"" is equal to four, and now, it's pretty straightforward. Our area is going to be equal to 12, the length of our base times our height, times four, times four, which is clearly just 48. 48, whatever, square, 48 square units.",math_geometry-home_geometry-coordinate-plane
" -  The dot plot shows the number of hours of daily driving time for 14 school bus drivers. Each dot represents a driver. So for example, one driver drives one hour a day. Two drivers drive two hours a day. One driver drives three hours a day. It looks like there's five drivers that drive seven hours a day. Which of the following is the closest estimate to the percentile rank for the driver with a daily driving time of six hours? And then they give us some choices. Which of the following is the closest estimate to the percentile rank for the driver with the daily driving time of six hours? So pause the video and see if you can figure out which of these percentiles is the closest estimate to the percentile rank of a driver with a daily driving time of six hours, looking at this data right over here. Alright, now let's work through this together. So when you think about percentile you really want to think about, so let me write this down. When we're talking about percentile we're really saying the percentage of the data that, and there's actually two ways that you could compute it. One is the percentage of the data that is below the amount in question, amount in question. The other possibility is the percent of the data that is at or below, that is at or below the amount, the amount in question. So if we look at this right over here, let's just figure out how many data points, what percentage of the data points are below six hours per day. So let's see, there are, I'm just gonna count 'em. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So seven of the 14 are below six hours. So we could just say seven, if we use this first technique we would have seven of the 14 are below six hours per day, and so that would get us a number of 50%, that six hours is at the 50th percentile. If we want to say what percentage is at that number or below then we would also count this one, so we would say eight, or eight out of 14. Eight out of 14, which is the same thing as four out of seven, and if we wanted to write that as a decimal, let's see, seven goes into four point zero zero zero, we just need to estimate. So seven goes into 40 five times. 35, we subtract, we get a five, bring down a zero, it goes five times. Look, it's just gonna be 0.5 repeating. So 55.5555%. So either of these would actually be a legitimate response to the percentile rank for the driver with the daily driving time of six hours. It depends on whether you include the six hours or not. So you could say either the 50th percentile or roughly the 55th, or actually the 56th percentile if you wanted to round to the nearest percentile. Now if you look at these choices here, lucky for us there's only one choice that's even, that's reasonably close to either one of those, and that's the 55th percentile, and it looks like the people who wrote this question went with the calculation of percentile where they include the data point in question. So everything at six hours or less, what percentage of the total data is that?",math_ap-statistics_density-curves-normal-distribution-ap
" -  We're asked, which value for D, and we see D in this equation here, makes X equals negative three an extraneous solution for this radical equation? Squared of 3x plus 25 is equal to D plus 2x. And I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about it on your own before we work through it together. Alright, now let's work through this together. So the first thing that just to remind ourselves is what is an extraneous solution? Well that's a solution that we get or we think we get but it's really just a by-product of how we solved it but isn't going to be an actual solution of our original equation. Now how do these extraneous solutions pop up? Well, it pops up when you take the square of both sides. So for this equation right over here, to get rid of the radical, I'd want to square both sides of it. If I square both sides, the lefthand side will become 3x plus 25 and the righthand side, if I square this, is going to be, what? It's going to be D squared plus 4, 4dx plus X squared. So that's just squaring both sides of this, but notice, there's actually a different equation than this one that if you squared both sides, you would also get this. What is that different equation? Well the different equation is if you took the negative of one of these sides. So for example, if you had, if you started the original equation, the negative square root of 3x plus 25 plus 25, is equal to D plus 2x. You square both sides of this, you still get this purple equation because you square a negative, you get a positive. So both of them, when you square both sides, get us over here. And so when you solve this purple equation, this is a quadratic right over here. You just rearrange it a little bit. You get into standard quadratic form, you'll get two solutions. And it turns out, one of the solutions is going to be for this yellow equation and one of the solutions is going to be for the purple equation. And if the solution that is for the purple equation, is going to be an extraneous solution for the yellow equation. This is actually not going to be a solution for the yellow equation. So when they say, ""Which value for D makes X equals ""negative three and extraneous solution ""for this yellow equation?"" That's the same thing as saying, ""What value of D makes X equals negative three ""a solution for this?"" So a solution for this. If it's a solution for this, it's going to be an extraneous solution for that 'cause these are two different equations. We're taking the negative of just one side of this equation to get this one. If you took the negative of both sides of this and that becomes the same thing 'cause you could multiply both sides of an equation times a negative value. So a solution for this, which is equivalently a solution which is equivalent to a solution, if I, instead of putting the negative on the lefthand side, if I multiply the righthand side by the negative. But anyway, let's think about which value for D makes X equals negative three a solution for this? Well, let's substitute X equals negative three here and then we just have to solve for D. If X equals negative three, this is going to be negative the square root of three times negative three is negative nine, plus 25 is equal to D. Two times negative three is negative six. So D minus 6, and so now we can square both sides of, we can square, actually let's do it this way. We can, I don't wanna square both sides 'cause we lose some information. It's going to be the negative square root of negative nine plus 25 is 16, is equal to D minus 6, so this is going to be equal to negative four. Principle over 16 is four. We have the negative out front, is equal to D minus six and then add six to both sides. You get two is equal to, two is equal to D. So if D is equal to two here, if D is equal to two, then a solution to this purple equation is going to be X equals negative three. And so that would be an extraneous solution because if X equals negative three satisfies this over here, it's definitely gonna satisfy this over here, but it's not going to satisfy this up here. And you could verify this if this is equal to two, try out X equals negative three. You're gonna get on the lefthand side, you're going to get 16 and on the righthand side, you're gonna get two minus six which is equal to negative four. Two minus six which is negative four, so this does not work out. X equals negative three is not a solution to this, but it is a solution for this and it is a solution to this quadratic right over here. So D equals two makes X equal negative three, an extraneous solution for this equation.",math_math3_equations
" I've gotten several requests to explain or teach the mean value theorem. So let's do that in this video. So this is the mean value theorem. And I have mixed feelings about the mean value theorem. It's kind of neat, but what you'll see is, it might not be obvious to prove, but the intuition behind it's pretty obvious. And the reason I have mixed feelings about it, is that even though, as you'll hopefully see, the intuition is pretty obvious, but they stick it in the math books, and people are just trying to learn calculus, and get to what matters, and then they put the mean value theorem in there, and they have all of this function notation, and they have all of these words, and it just confuses people. So hopefully this video will clarify that little bit, and I'm curious to see what you think of it. So let's see. What does the mean value theorem say? Let me draw some axes. I'll do a visual explanation first. I think this calls for magenta. So that's my x-axis. This is my y-axis. And let's say I have some function f of x. So let me draw my f of x. That's as good as any. And this is some function f of x, and I'm going to put a few conditions on f of x. f of x has to be continuous and differentiable. And I know a lot of you probably get intimidated when you hear these words. It sounds like what a mathematician would say, and it sounds very abstract. All continuous means is that the curve is connected to itself as you go along it. And here, the conditions are over a closed interval. This is another very mathy term you'll see. So you'll often say, on a closed interval from a to b. All that means is an interval, let's say a is the low point, let's say this is a, we don't know what number that is. That could be minus 5, or who knows. And let's say this is b, right here, let me b right here. Let's say that's be. So when people talk about a closed interval, defined on a closed interval, that means that the function needs to be defined at every number between a and b, and the function needs to be defined at a and at b. If they said over an open interval between a and b, that means that it's only defined at every value between a and b, but not necessarily at a and b. So it has to be continuous, differentiable, and let's say it's defined over the closed interval, and this is just the notation for it, a b. So that means, it has to be defined at all of the x values from a to b, including a and b. If it was an open interval, you would write it like this. You'd write a and b. That means an interval for all the numbers between a and b, but not including those. So let's ignore that for now. So back to the mean value theorem. So you know, hopefully, what continuous means. Let me draw here a function that's not continuous. So a function that is not continuous would look like this. It would go like this, and it would start up here, go like that. Right? So this would be an example of a function, let's say, same axes, let me draw it in a different color. If that was our y-- no, that's not a good. If that was our y-axis, and that was our x-axis, just to give you the reference for what I drew. So if the function is continuous, continuous, continuous, and then it jumps, that disconnect, that would make this function discontinuous, or it would not be a continuous function. So a function just has to be continuous. And now what does differentiable mean? Differentiable means that at every point over the interval that we care about, you have to be able to find the derivative. That means you can take the derivative of it. It's a differentiable. And what else does that mean? Well, that means that if you were to graph the derivative of this function, that it is also continuous. And I'll let you think about that for a second. And actually, in this video I'm going to show you an example of a function that is continuous, but not differentiable and because of that, the mean value theorem breaks down. But anyway, let's get back to the mean value theorem. Most of the functions we deal with satisfy all three of these things. Unless, you know, you're doing limit problems, and they try to make these things break down. Anyway, back to the function. So this function meets all of these requirements. So all it says is, if I were take the average slope between point a and point b. So what is the slope, the average slope between point a and point b? Well, slope is just rise over run, right? So what is it? Let me see if I can draw the average slope. So the run would be this distance. That'd be the run, right, and this would be the rise. So this is the point, right here, that's the point a, f of a. Over here, this is the point b, f of b. So what's the average slope between a and b? Well, it's rise over run. So what's the rise? What's this distance? How much have we gone up from f of a to f of b? Well, the rise will just be f of b, this height, minus f of a. f of b minus f of a. And what's the run, what's this distance? Well, it's just b minus a. And if I were to draw a line that has that average slope, it would look something like this. We could make it go through those two points, but it really doesn't have to. Let me do it in a blue. So that's the average slope between those two points, right? So what does the mean value theorem tell us? It says, if f of x is defined over this closed interval from a to b, and f of x is continuous, and it's differentiable, that you could take the derivative at any point, that there must be some points c f prime of c is equal to this thing. So is equal to f prime of c. I shouldn't have written it here. So what is that telling us? So all that's telling us, is if we're continuous, differentiable, defined over the closed interval, that there's some point c, oh, and c has to be between a and b, there's some point between a and b, and it could be at one of the points, but there's some point c where the derivative at c, or the slope at c, the instantaneous slope at c, is exactly equal to the average slope over that interval. So what does that mean? So we can look at it visually. Is there any point along this curve where the slope looks very similar to this average slope that we calculated? Well, sure, let's see. It looks like, maybe, this point, right here? Just the way I drew it. This is very inexact. But that point looks like the slope, you know, I could say the slope is something like that, right there. So we don't know what, analytically, this function is, but visually, you could see that at this point c, the derivative, so I just picked that point. So this could be our point c. And how do we just say that? Well, because f prime of c is this slope, and it's equal to the average slope. So f prime of c is this thing, and it's going to be equal to the average slope over the whole thing. And this curve actually probably has another point where the slope is equal to the average slope. Let's see. This one looks, like, right around there. Just the way I drew it. Looks like the slope there could look something like, could be parallel as well. These lines should be parallel. The tangent lines should be parallel. So hopefully that makes a little sense to you. Another way to think about it is that your average, actually, let me draw a graph just to make sure that we hit the point home. Let's draw my position as a function of time. So this is something, this'll make it applicable to the real world. So that's my x-axis, or the time axis, that's my position axis. This is going back to our original intuition of what even a derivative is. So this is time, and I call this position, or distance, or it doesn't matter. Position. And if I was moving at a constant velocity, my position as a function of time would just be a straight line, right? And the velocity is actually your slope. But let's say I had a varying velocity. And in reality, if you're driving a car, you are always at a variable velocity. So let's say I start at a standstill at time t equals 0, and then I accelerate, then I decelerate a little bit, decelerate a little bit, I keep decelerating, and then I come to a standstill, so my position stays still. Then I accelerate again, decelerate, accelerate, et cetera. Right? So this could be, you know, I have a variable velocity, and this could be my position as a function of time. So all this says, let's say that after, this 1is time 0, position 0. 1Let's say after 1 hour, let's say that is 1 hour, this time 1equals 1 hour, let's say I have gone 60 miles. 1So what can you say? 1You could say that my average velocity equals just change in 1distance divided by change in times. 1It equals 60 miles per hour. 1So what the mean values theorem says, is OK. 1Your average velocity, so you could almost view it as the 1average slope between this point and this point with 60, 1if your average velocity was 60 miles per hour, there was some 1point in time, maybe more, but there was at least one point in 1time, where you were going exactly sixty miles per hour. 1That make sense, right? 1If you average 60 miles per hour, maybe you're going 40 1miles per hour some of the point, but at some point you 1went 80, and in between you had to be going 60 miles per hour. 1So let me see if I can draw that graphically. 1So this slope is my average velocity, and the way I drew 1it, there's probably two points, let's see, probably 1right around here, I was probably going 60 miles per 1hour, the slope is probably 60 there, the instantaneous 1velocity probably there, as well. 1So before I leave, let's do this analytically, just 1to work with numbers. 1And the reason why I have mixed feelings about the mean value 1theorem, it's useful later on, probably if you become a math 1major you'll maybe use it to prove some theorems, or maybe 1you'll prove it, itself. 1But if you're just applying calculus for the most part, 1you're not going to be using the mean value 1theorem too much. 1But anyway, if you've got to know it, you've got to know it, 1and it tells you something else about the world, so it's 1interesting that way. 1So let's say we have the function f of x is equal to x 1squared minus 4x, and the interval that I care about 1here is between, is a closed interval, so I'm including 12, from 2 to 4. 1Now, the mean value theorem tells us that if this 1function is defined on this interval, and it is, right? 1We could put any number. 1The domain of this is actually all real numbers, I could put 1any number here, so obviously it's going to be defined 1over this interval. 1But so it's defined over the interval, this is continuous, 1this is differentiable. 1You could take the derivative, and the derivative 1is continuous. 1So the mean value theorem should apply here. 1So let's see what value of c is equal to the average 1slope between 2 and 4. 1So what's the average slope between 2 and 4? 1Well, it's going to be f of 4, so the change in the function, 1f of 4 minus f of 2 divided by the change in x, so 4 minus 2. 1So this equal to the average slope. 1So f of 4 is 16 minus 16, right? 1So that's 0. 1Let me make sure of that. 14 times 4, 16, minus 4 times 4, 16, right. 1Minus f of 2. 1f of 2 is 2 squared, is 4, right, and then 1minus 4 times 2. 1So minus 8. 1All of that over 2. 1And so this equals minus 4. 1So this equals 4 over 2. 1So the average slope from x is equal to 2 to x 1is equal to 4 is 2. 1And now the mean value theorem tells us, that there must be 1some point that's between these two, maybe including one of 1those, where the slope at that point is exactly equal to 2. 1Let's figure out what point that is. 1That c. 1Let's take the derivative, because the derivative at c 1is going to be equal to 2. 1So we just take the derivative. 1So let's say f prime of x is equal to 2x minus four. 1And we want to figure out, at what x value does this equal 2. 1So we say, 12x minus 4 is equal to 2. 1Where does the slope equal 2? 1And you get 2x is equal to 6, x is equal to 3. 1So if x is equal to 3, the derivative is exactly equal 1to the average slope. 1But let me see if I can, let me get the graphing 1calculator here. 1Let me what I can do. 1OK. 1So here's the graph of x squared minus 4x. 1Let me see if I can make it a little bit bigger. 1The interval that we care about is from here to here. 1So the average slope over that interval was 2. 1So if we were to draw the slope, it was like that, the 1slope would look like that. 1And at the point 3, the slope is exactly 2. 1So let me actually draw that. 1This isn't too hard to draw, for myself. 1Let me see. 1So if that's the x-axis, I'll want that graph out of the way. 1That's the y-axis. 1So the graph goes through the point 0, 0 as 1neatly as possible. 1Nope, that's not neat. 1So the graph goes something like this, it dips up, then it 1goes like that, and actually it keeps going straight up, 1like that, it's a parabola. 1So this is point 4. 1The point 2 is here. 1And at 2 we're at negative 4, so the vertex is at 1the point 2, minus four. 1So what we said, the average slope, so the closed interval 1that we care about, between 2 and 4, it's from 2 1here to 4 here. 1That's the interval, 2 to 4. 1The average slope is 2. 1Doesn't look like it, only because I've kind of 1compressed the y-axis. 1And we're saying, at the point x is equal to 3, the slope 1is equal to exactly that. 1So at x is equal to three, the slope is equal 1to the same thing. 1That's all the mean value theorem is. 1I know sounds complicated. 1People talk about continuity, and differentiability, and f 1prime of c, and all this, but all it says is, there's some 1point between these two points where the instantaneous slope, 1or slope exactly at that point, is equal to the slope 1between these two points. 1Hope I didn't confuse you.",math_calculus-all-old_derivative-applications-calc
" You are by now probably used to the idea of measuring angles in degrees. We use it in everyday language. We've done some examples on this playlist where if you had an angle like that, you might call that a 30-degree angle. If you have an angle like this, you could call that a 90-degree angle. And we'd often use this symbol, just like that. If you were to go 180 degrees, you'd essentially form a straight line. Let me make these proper angles. If you go 360 degrees, you have essentially done one full rotation. And if you watch figure skating on the Olympics, and someone does a rotation, they'll say, oh, they did a 360. Or especially in some skateboarding competitions, and things like that. But the one thing to realize-- and it might not be obvious right from the get-go-- but this whole notion of degrees, this is a human-constructed system. This is not the only way that you can measure angles. And if you think about it, you'll say, well, why do we call a full rotation 360 degrees? And there's some possible theories. And I encourage you to think about them. Why does 360 degrees show up in our culture as a full rotation? Well, there's a couple of theories there. One is ancient calendars. And even our calendar is close to this, but ancient calendars were based on 360 days in a year. Some ancient astronomers observed that things seemed to move 1/360 of the sky per day. Another theory is the ancient Babylonians liked equilateral triangles a lot. And they had a base 60 number system. So they had 60 symbols. We only have 10. We have a base 10. They had 60. So in our system, we like to divide things into 10. They probably liked to divide things into 60. So if you had a circle, and you divided it into 6 equilateral triangles, and each of those equilateral triangles you divided into 60 sections, because you have a base 60 number system, then you might end up with 360 degrees. What I want to think about in this video is an alternate way of measuring angles. And that alternate way-- even though it might not seem as intuitive to you from the get-go-- in some ways is much more mathematically pure than degrees. It's not based on these cultural artifacts of base 60 number systems or astronomical patterns. To some degree, an alien on another planet would not use degrees, especially if the degrees are motivated by these astronomical phenomena. But they might use what we're going to define as a radian. There's a certain degree of purity here-- radians. So let's just cut to the chase and define what a radian is. So let me draw a circle here, my best attempt at drawing a circle. Not bad. And let me draw the center of the circle. And now let me draw this radius. And let's say that this radius-- and you might already notice the word radius is very close to the word radians. And that's not a coincidence. So let's say that this circle has a radius of length r. Now let's construct an angle. I'll call that angle theta. So let's construct an angle theta. So let's call this angle right over here theta. And let's just say, for the sake of argument, that this angle is just the exact right measure so that if you look at the arc that subtends this angle-- and that seems like a very fancy word. But let me draw the angle. So if you were to draw the angle-- so if you look at the arc that subtends the angle, that's a fancy word. That's really just talking about the arc along the circle that intersects the two sides of the angles. So this arc right over here subtends the angle theta. So let me write that down. Subtends this arc, subtends angle theta. Let's say theta is the exact right size so that this arc is also the same length as the radius of the circle. So this arc is also of length r. So given that, if you were defining a new type of angle measurement, and you wanted to call it a radian, which is very close to a radius, how many radians would you define this angle to be? Well, the most obvious one, if you kind of view a radian as another way of saying radiuses, or I guess radii. Well, you say, look, this is subtended by an arc of one radius. So why don't we call this right over here one radian, which is exactly how a radian is defined. When you have a circle, and you have an angle of one radian, the arc that subtends it is exactly one radius long. Which you can imagine might be a little bit useful as we start to interpret more and more types of circles. When you give a degrees, you really have to do a little bit of math and think about the circumference and all of that to think about how many radiuses are subtending that angle. Here, the angle in radians tells you exactly the arc length that is subtending the angles. So let's do a couple of thought experiments here. So given that, what would be the angle in radians if we were to go-- so let me draw another circle here. So that's the center, and we'll start right over there. So what would happen if I had an angle-- if I wanted to measure in radians, what angle would this be in radians? And you could almost think of it as radiuses. So what would that angle be? Going one full revolution in degrees, that would be 360 degrees. Based on this definition, what would this be in radians? Well, let's think about the arc that subtends this angle. The arc that subtends this angle is the entire circumference of this circle. Well, what's the circumference of a circle in terms of radiuses? So if this has length r, if the radius is length r, what's the circumference of the circle in terms of r? Well, we know that. That's going to be 2 pi r. So going back to this angle, the length of the arc that subtends this angle is how many radiuses? Well, it's 2 pi radiuses. It's 2 pi times r. So this angle right over here, I'll call this a different-- well, let's call this angle x. x in this case is going to be 2 pi radians. And it is subtended by an arc length of 2 pi radiuses. If the radius was one unit, then this would be 2 pi times 1, 2 pi radiuses. So given that, let's start to think about how we can convert between radians and degrees, and vice versa. If I were to have-- and we can just follow up over here. If we do one full revolution-- that is, 2 pi radians-- how many degrees is this going to be equal to? Well, we already know this. A full revolution in degrees is 360 degrees. Well, I could either write out the word degrees, or I can use this little degree notation there. Actually, let me write out the word degrees. It might make things a little bit clearer that we're kind of using units in both cases. Now, if we wanted to simplify this a little bit, we could divide both sides by 2. In which case, on the left-hand side, we would get pi radians would be equal to how many degrees? Well, it would be equal to 180 degrees. And I could write it that way, or I could write it that way. And you see over here, this is 180 degrees. And you also see if you were to draw a circle around here, we've gone halfway around the circle. So the arc length, or the arc that subtends the angle, is half the circumference. Half the circumference is pi radiuses. So we call this pi radians. Pi radians is 180 degrees. And from this, we can come up with conversions. So one radian would be how many degrees? Well, to do that, we would just have to divide both sides by pi. And on the left-hand side, you'd be left with 1-- I'll just write it singular now. 1 radian is equal to-- I'm just dividing both sides. Let me make it clear what I'm doing here, just to show you this isn't some voodoo. So I'm just dividing both sides by pi here. On the left-hand side, you're left with 1. And on the right-hand side, you're left with 180/pi degrees. So 1 radian is equal to 180/pi degrees, which is starting to make it an interesting way to convert them. Let's think about it the other way. If I were to have 1 degree, how many radians is that? Well, let's start off with-- let me rewrite this thing over here. We said pi radians is equal to 180 degrees. So now we want to think about 1 degree. So let's solve for 1 degree. 1 degree, we can divide both sides by 180. We are left with pi/180 radians is equal to 1 degree. 1So pi/180 radians is equal to 1 degree. 1This might seem confusing and daunting. 1And it was for me the first time I 1was exposed to this, especially because we're not 1exposed to this in our everyday life. 1But what we're going to see over the next few examples 1is that as long as we keep in mind this whole idea 1that 2 pi radians is equal to 360 degrees, 1or that pi radians is equal to 180 degrees, which is the two 1things that I do keep in my mind. 1We can always re-derive these two things. 1You might say, hey, how do I remember 1if it's pi/180 or 180/pi to convert the two things? 1Well, just remember, which is hopefully intuitive, 1that 2 pi radians is equal to 360 degrees. 1And we'll work through a bunch of examples in the next video, 1to just make sure that we're used 1to converting one way or the other.",math_engageny-geo_geo-5
" Let's think about what might happen to the boiling point or the freezing point of any solution if we start adding particles, or we start adding solute to it. For our visualization, let's just think about water again. It doesn't have to be water. It can be any solvent, but let's just think about water in its liquid state. The particles are reasonably disorganized because of their kinetic energy, but they still have that hydrogen bonds that wants to make them be near each other. So this is in the liquid state, and they have a reasonable amount of kinetic energy. You know, each of these particles is moving in some direction, rubbing against each other, bouncing off of each other. Now, to move it into the solid state, or to freeze it, what has to happen? The ice has to enter kind of a crystalline structure. It has to get pretty organized, so let's say it has to look something like this. The water molecules are going to have a regular structure where the hydrogen bonds dominate any kind of kinetic movement they want to do, and all the kinetic movement, they're just vibrating in place. So you have to get a little bit orderly right there, right? And then, obviously, this lattice structure goes on and on with a gazillion water molecules. But the interesting thing is that this somehow has to get organized. And what happens if we start introducing molecules into this water? Let's say the example of sodium-- actually, I won't do any example. Let's just say some arbitrary molecule, if I were to introduce it there, if I were to put something-- let me draw it again. So now I'll just use that same-- I'll introduce some molecules, and let's say they're pretty large, so they push all of these water molecules out of the way. So the water molecules are now on the outside of that, and let's have another one that's over here, some relatively large molecules of solute relative to water, and this is because a water molecule really isn't that big. Now, do you think it's going to be easier or harder to freeze this? Are you going to have to remove more or less energy to get to a frozen state? Well, because these molecules, they're not going to be part of this lattice structure because frankly, they wouldn't even fit into it. They're actually going to make it harder for these water molecules to get organized because to get organized, they have to get at the right distance for the hydrogen bonds to form. But in this case, even as you start removing heat from the system, maybe the ones that aren't near the solute particles, they'll start to organize with each other. But then when you introduce a solute particle, let's say a solute particle is sitting right here. It's going to be very hard for someone to organize with this guy, to get near enough for the hydrogen bond to start taking hold. This distance would make it very difficult. And so the way I think about it is that these solute particles make the structure irregular, or they add more disorder, and we'll eventually talk about entropy and all of that. But they make it more irregular, and it's making it harder to get into a regular form. And so the intuition is is that this should lower the boiling point or make it-- oh, sorry, lower the melting point. So solute particles make you have a lower boiling point. Let's say if we're talking about water at standard temperature and pressure or at one atmosphere then instead of going to 0 degrees, you might have to go to negative 1 or negative 2 degrees, and we're going to talk a little bit about what that is. Now, what's the intuition of what this will do when you want to go into a gaseous state, when you want to boil it? So my initial gut was, hey, I'm already in a disordered state, which is closer to what a gas is, so wouldn't that make it easier to boil? But it turns out it also makes it harder to boil, and this is how I think about it. Remember, everything with boiling deals with what's happening at the surface, and we talked about that in our vapor pressure. So at the surface, we said if I have a bunch of water molecules in the liquid state, we knew that although the average temperature might not be high enough for the water molecules to evaporate, that there's a distribution of kinetic energies. And some of these water molecules on the surface because the surface ones might be going fast enough to escape. And when they escape into vapor, then they create a vapor pressure above here. And if that vapor pressure is high enough, you can almost view them as linemen blocking the way for more molecules to kind of run behind them as they block all of the other ambient air pressure above them. So if there's enough of them and they have enough energy, they can start to push back or to push outward is the way I think about it, so that more guys can come in behind them. So I hope that lineman analogy doesn't completely lose you. Now, what happens if you were to introduce solute into it? Some of the solute particle might be down here. It probably doesn't have much of an effect down here, but some of it's going to be bouncing on the surface, so they're going to be taking up some of the surface area. And because, and this is at least how I think of it, since they're going to be taking up some of the surface area, you're going to have less surface area exposed to the solvent particle or to the solution or the stuff that'll actually vaporize. You're going to have a lower vapor pressure. And remember, your boiling point is when the vapor pressure, when you have enough particles with enough kinetic energy out here to start pushing against the atmospheric pressure, when the vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure, you start boiling. But because of these guys, I have a lower vapor pressure. So I'm going to have to add even more kinetic energy, more heat to the system in order to get enough vapor pressure up here to start pushing back the atmospheric pressure. So solute also raises the boiling point. So the way that you can think about it is solute, when you add something to a solution, it's going to make it want to be in the liquid state more. Whether you lower the temperature, it's going to want to stay in liquid as opposed to ice, and if you raise the temperature, it's going to want to stay in liquid as opposed to gas. I found this neat-- hopefully, it shows up well on this video. I have to give due credit, this is from chem.purdue.edu/ gchelp/solutions/eboil.html, but I thought it was a pretty neat graphic, or at least a visualization. This is just the surface of water molecules, and it gives you a sense of just how things vaporize as well. There's some things on the surface that just bounce off. And here's an example where they visualized sodium chloride at the surface. And because the sodium chloride is kind of bouncing around on the surface with the water molecules, fewer of those water molecules kind of have the room to escape, so the boiling point gets elevated. Now, the question is by how much does it get elevated? And this is one of the neat things in life is that the answer is actually quite simple. The change in boiling or freezing point, so the change in temperature of vaporization, is equal to some constant times the number of moles, or at least the mole concentration, the molality, times the molality of the solute that you're putting into your solution. So, for example, let's say I have 1 kilogram of-- so let's say my solvent is water. I'll switch colors. And I have 1 kilogram of water, and let's say we're just at atmospheric pressure. And let's say I have some sodium chloride, NaCl. And let's say I have 2 moles of NaCl. I'll have 2 moles. The question is how much will this raise the boiling point of this water? So first of all, you just have to figure out the molality, which is just equal to the number of moles of solute, this 2 moles, divided by the number of kilograms of solvent. So let's say we have 1 kilogram of solvent. This was, of course, moles. So our molality is 2 moles per kilogram. So we just have to figure out what this constant is, and then we'll know the temperature elevation. And actually, that same Purdue site, they gave a list of tables. I haven't run the experiments myself. They have some neat charts here. But they say, OK water, normal boiling point is 100 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure. And then they say that the constant is 0.512 Celsius degrees per mole. So let's just say 0.5. So it equals 0.5. So k is equal to 0.5. And I want to be very clear here because this is a very-- I won't say a subtle point, but it's an interesting point. So I said that there's 2-- the molality of-- I just realized I made a mistake. I said the molality of sodium chloride is 2. 2 moles per kilograms. But that would be if sodium chloride stayed in this molecular state, if it stayed together, right? But what happens is that the sodium chloride actually disassociates, and we learned all about it in that previous video. Each molecule or each sodium chloride pair disassociates 1into two molecules, into a sodium ion 1and a chlorine anion. 1And because of that, because this disassociates into two, 1the molality is actually going to be two times the number of 1moles of sodium chloride I have. So it's going to be two 1times this. 1So my molality will actually be 4. 1And this is an interesting point. 1If I was dealing with-- and I wrote it here. 1So this right here is glucose, and this is sodium chloride, 1or at least sodium chloride in its crystal form. 1One molecule, I guess you can view it, or one salt of it. 1I guess you could just view it as one of these little pairs 1right here. 1But the interesting thing is is you could have the same 1number of moles of sodium chloride when you view it as a 1compound and glucose. 1But glucose, when it goes into water, it just stays as one 1molecule of glucose. 1So a mole of glucose will disassociate into a mole of 1glucose in water. 1Well, I guess it won't disassociate. 1It'll just stay as one mole, while a mole of sodium 1chloride will turn into two moles because it 1disassociates. 1It turns into two separate particles. 1So in my example, when I start with a mole of this, I end 1up-- actually, once I dissolve it in water, I ended up with 4 1moles per kilogram of molality, because this turns 1into two particles. 1So given that the molality is 4 moles. 12 moles of sodium, 2 moles of chloride per kilogram. 1So I just use that constant that I just got from Purdue. 1And I get the change in temperature is equal to that 1constant, 0.5, times 4, which is equal to 2 degrees. 1So my boiling point will be elevated by 2 degrees. 1Now, if I had the same number of moles, if I had 2 moles of 1glucose dissolved into my water, I'd only get half as 1much, half as much of an increase. 1Because the molality would be half as much. 1Because it doesn't turn into two particles. 1In some textbooks, you'll actually see it 1written like this. 1You'll actually see the same formula written like change in 1boiling temperature, or vapor temperature, or whatever you 1want to think, is equal to k times m times i, where they'll 1say this is the molality of the compound 1you're talking about. 1In this case, this number would be 2, and i is the 1number of molecules or the number of things that it 1disassociates into. 1So in this case, this would have been 2. 1And that's where we would have gotten 4 times k, which is 10.5, which is 2. 1In the case of water, this would be-- oh, sorry, in the 1case of the glucose, this would still be 2. 1But it only turns into one particle when it goes in the 1water, so that would be 1. 1So you would only have a 1 degree increase in the boiling 1point of water. 1Now, freezing point is the same thing. 1Change in freezing point is also 1proportional to the molality. 1And you can either say the molality of the original 1non-in-water compound times the number of compounds it 1disassociates into, although this k is going to be 1different for freezing than it is for boiling. 1Of course, this k changes at different pressures and for 1different elements. 1But the really big takeaway is just to realize that even if 1you have a mole of this and a mole of that, and they're 1going to be dissolved into the same amount of water, because 1this dissociates into two particles and this 1disassociates into only one for every-- or this 1disassociates into two moles for every mole of the crystal 1you have-- this doesn't disassociate; it just stays as 1one-- this'll have twice as large of an effect on the 1freezing point change or on the boiling point elevation 1than the glucose will.",science_chemistry_states-of-matter-and-intermolecular-forces
" -  What I wanna do in this video is think about how does the value of an expression change as a variable that makes up that expression changes? So, let's start with a pretty simple expression. Let's say we have the expression 100 minus x. We wanna know how does this expression change as x increases? As x increases and like always, try to work it out for yourself. Pause the video before I try to have a go at it. Well, there's a couple of ways you could think about it. You say, ""Okay, I have 100 and I'm subtracting x."" So, as x increases, as x increases over here, I'm going to be subtracting larger and larger values. So, if I'm subtracting larger and larger values, I'm going to get smaller and smaller values. So, this whole thing, this whole thing is going to decrease. This whole thing is going to decrease and if you wanna make it a little bit more concrete, you can actually try out some values there. So, you can make a little table here. X and then, what is 100 - x going to be? I'm just gonna pick some values of x. I'm gonna make them increase. Say, x is zero, x is 50, x is 100. Well, when an x is zero, 100 - x is 100 - zero. So, it's 100. When x is 50, it's going be 100 - 50, so it's going to be 50. When x is 100, it's 100 - 100, so it's zero. So, it's pretty clear here that as x is increasing, as x is increasing, I'll just write incr. for increasing, we see that 100 - x is decreasing. We see that that is decreasing. Let's do this with a couple more expressions that have different forms. So, let's say that I have the expression. Let's say that I have the expression five over x plus five and x is decreasing, x is decreasing, but we also know that it is positive and even while it's decreasing, it's staying above zero. So, we're saying x is staying greater than zero. So, in this case, so ya know, this could be a situation where x is decreasing from 10 to nine or a million to 100,000, but it's staying positive while it's decreasing. Let's think about that. We are going to be dividing by smaller and smaller positive values. So, as you have smaller and smaller positive values of the denominator, you're dividing by smaller and smaller positive values. So, if you're dividing by smaller positive values, you're going to know that this thing is going to get larger. This entire expression is going to get larger as you divide by smaller and smaller positive values. So, if that expression gets larger, then you're just adding five to it. The whole thing is going to increase. The whole thing is going to increase as, the whole thing is going to increase as x decreases while staying positive. And once again, we can make a little table to take a look at that. So, this is x, this is five over x plus five. Now, let's see. I'll just try out some. Let's see, I'll go from x 100 to x is five, to x is one. So, this is clearly x is decreasing. X is decreasing. When x is 100, you're gonna have five divided by 100, which would be five hundredths plus five, so it would be 5.05. When x is five, you're gonna have five divided by five, which is one plus five, which is six. When x is one, you're gonna have five divided by one, which is five plus five. You just, it's 10. So notice, when x is staying positive, but decreasing, the whole expression, five over x plus five, this thing right over here is increasing. Let's do one more of these. So, let's say that we have the expression and we'll change up the variable here. 3y over 2y and I'm curious what happens to the value of this expression as y increases, as y increases. Well, as you have larger y's here on the numerator, you're also going to have larger y's here in the denominator and one way you could think about this, this is the same thing as three halves times y over y. And no matter what y you have here, as long as it's not equal to zero and actually, let's just assume that it doesn't cross zero because at that point, at that point, this thing would become undefined. Let's just say that y increases and y is greater than zero just for simplicity. So, y is a positive value here and actually, for any non-zero value, you take y, you divide by y, you're just gonna get one. So, it doesn't matter what y is. Y could be a million over a million. This thing is just gonna be one. Y could be five over five, it's still just going to be one. The value of the expression is not going to change. It's just going to be three halves. So, the expression is just going to be the same. You're not going to have any change as y increases, as y is positive and it increases.",math_cc-sixth-grade-math_cc-6th-expressions-and-variables
" So, in this problem, they're telling us in outer space, the distance an object travels varies directly with the amount of time that it travels. And, that's of course assuming that it's not accelerating, and there's no net force, and all of that on it. So, I guess they're talking about a specific object. So, some specific object, the amount, the distance that it travels is directly, it varies directly, it varies directly with the amount of time that it travels. So, if we think of in, in, in terms of constants of proportionality, and direct variation, we could say that the distance, we could say that the distance is equal to some constant, times the time, times the time that it travels. The distance varies directly with the amount of time that travels for this particular object. If an asteroid travels 3000 miles, in, if the asteroid travels 3000 miles in 6 hours, what is the constant of variation? So the distance is 3000, so we have d is equal to 3000 miles. We have 3,000 miles is the distance, and that's going to be equal to the constant of variation. The constant of variation times the time, times 6 hours. So, if we wanna solve for the constant of variation, we can just divide both sides by 6 hours. 6 hours, and we divide the right-hand side by 6 hours. And, so, 3,000 divided by 6 is 500, and 6 divided by 6 is 1. The hours also cancel out if you care about the units. And, so, the concept of proportionality, the left-hand side is just 500, 500, and then we have miles per hour, miles per hour. Fired 500 miles per hour, and that is equal to k. So, the constant proportionality is 500 miles per hour, or you could say 500 if you're not too worried about the units. Or, we should say, the constant of variation, to use the terminology that they actually use in the question.",math_algebra-home_alg-rational-expr-eq-func
" In the last video, I told you that if I had a hyperbola with the equation x squared over a squared minus y squared over b squared is equal to 1, that the focal distance for this hyperbola is just equal to the square root of the sum of these two numbers. The square root of a squared plus b squared. In this video I really just want to show you that. And actually, just so you know, this equation right here, this is a particular hyperbola that opens to the left and the right. And that's because those are the asymptote points. Those would be the axis. And that's because the x term is positive. If the y term was positive and the x term had a negative sign, then the hyperbola would open upwards and downwards, like that. And the proof that I'm showing you in this video, it's just a bunch of algebra, really, is identical in the y case, you'd just switch around x's and the y's. But I just wanted to make sure you realize that. That I'm just doing a particular case of hyperbola that opens the left and the right. I could call it a horizontal hyperbola, instead of a vertical one, but I wanted to make it clear there is another type of hyperbola. But anyway, let's draw a graphical representation of all this just to make sure we understand, or we re-understand, or better understand what the foci points are and where they sit on the hyperbola So those are my axis. The asymptotes of this hyperbola are the lines y is equal to plus or minus b over a. Oh woops, not using my line tool. So, that's one and that's the other asymptote. then the hyperbola will look something like this. It looks something like that. It's going to intersect at a comma 0, right there. This is going to be a comma 0. And the intersect at minus a comma 0. We saw this in the previous video. It looks something like that. And then the focus points are going to sit out here someplace. There and there. And the focal length this a squared plus b square. The square root of a squared plus b squared. That's just this distance right here. That distance is the focal length. So this is going to be the point f,0 and this is going to be the point minus f,0. Now we learned in the last video that one of the definitions of a hyperbola is the locus of all points, or the set of all points, where if I take the difference of the distances to the two foci, that difference will be a constant number. So if this is the point x comma y, and it could be any point that satisfies this equation, it's any point on the byperbola, we know, or we are told, that if we take this distance right here-- --let's call that d1 --and subtract from that the distance to the high other foci-- call that d2 --that that number is a constant regardless of where we are on the hyperbola. In fact the locus of all points are-- the hyperbole in fact is all of the points that satisfy that condition. And we learned in last video just by taking the difference of the distance, we picked this point and we said, OK, what's that distance minus that distance. And we figured out that it's 2a. So d1 minus d2 is equal to-- I'm going off the video screen --d1 minus d2 is equal to 2a. So let's use this fact right here that d1 minus d2 is equal to 2a, to try to prove this. Right there. So the first thing to do is figure out what d1 and d2. Just using the distance formula. So what's d1? d1 is the distance between this point and this point minus f0. So what you do is we just use the distance formula, which is really just Pythagorean theorem. So it's the difference of the x's. It's the x distance. So it's x minus f squared plus the y distances. y minus 0, so that's just y, squared. Take the square root of that. So that's d1, right there. d1. And we want to subtract from that d2. the difference of the distances, and in this case d1 is definitely bigger than d2. Or you could take the absolute values if you didn't want to worry about that. And so here, we get the square root of x minus f, x minus f squared, plus y squared. What does that equal to? Well, we said that equals to 2a, that equals this distance right here. So that is equal to 2a. Now let's see if we can simplify this at all. Well an interesting thing to do my just to be the put this on the other side of the equation. And this just can get hairy, so I really hope I don't make any careless mistakes. So this becomes-- and I might write small to save space --this becomes x plus f, right, minus minus, squared plus y squared is equal to 2a plus the square root of x minus f squared plus y squared. Now, to get rid of these radicals, let's square both sides of this equation. The left hand side, if you were to square it just becomes x plus f squared plus y squared. And then to square this we have to square the first term, which is 4a squared. Then we multiply the two terms and multiply that by 2, right? We're just taking this whole thing and squaring it, so that's-- and this is just a review of kind of binomial algebra --so this is equal to plus 2a times this times 2 is 4a times the square root of x minus f squared plus y. y squared, I don't want to lose that squared right there. And then we square this term. And this is just multiplying a binomial. So that's equal to-- you just get rid of the radical sign, and I'm just going to be staying in that color for now --that's equal to x minus f squared plus y squared. And already it looks like there's some cancellation that we can do. We can cancel out-- there's a y squared on both sides of this equation --so let's just cancel those out. Subtract y squared from both sides of the equation. And let's multiply this term out. So this right here is x squared plus 2xf plus f squared. And then that is equal to 4a squared plus 4a times the square root of x minus f squared plus y squared. And then multiply this out. Plus x squared minus 2xf plus f squared. And then let's see, what can we cancel out. We have x squared on both sides of this, we subtract x squared from both sides of the equation. We have an f squared on both sides of the equation so let's cancel that out. And let's see, what can we do to simplify it. So we have a minus 2xf and a plus 2xf. Let's add 2xf to both sides this equation or bring this term over here. So if you add 2xf to both sides of this equation-- let's see, my phone is ringing, let me just turn it off --if you add 2xf to both sides of this equation, what do you get? You get 4xf-- remember I just brought this term over this left hand side --is equal to 4a squared plus 4a times a square root of x minus f squared plus y squared. It's easy to get lost in the algebra. Remember all we're doing, just to kind of remind you of what this whole point was, we're just simplifying the difference of the distances between these two points, and then see how it relates to the equation of the hyperbola itself. The a's and the b's. Let's take this 4a put it on this side, so you get 4xf minus 4a squared is equal to 4a times the square root of-- well let's just multiply this out 'cause we'll probably have to eventually --x squared minus 2xf plus f squared plus y squared. That's this just multiplied out. That's the y squared right there. We could divide both sides of this by 4. All I'm trying to do is just simplify this as much as possible, so then this becomes xf minus a squared is equal to a times the square root of this whole thing. x squared minus 2xf plus f squared plus why squared. And now we could square both sides of this equation right here. And then if you square both sides, this side becomes x squared f squared minus 2a squared xf plus a to the fourth. That's this side squared. And that's equal to, if you square the right hand side, a squared times the square of a square root is just that expression, x squared minus 2xf plus f squared plus y squared. This really is quite hairy. And let's see what we can do now. Let's divide both sides of this equation by a squared, and then you get x squared-- I'm really just trying to simplify this as 1much as possible --over a squared minus-- so the a 1squareds cancel out --minus 2xf plus a to the fourth divided a 1square well that's just a squared. 1So a squared is equal to x squared minus 2xf plus f 1squared plus y squared. 1Well good. 1There's something to cancel out. 1There's a mine 2xf on both sides of this equation so 1let's cancel that out. 1Simplify our situation a little bit. 1And let's see, we have. 1so we could do is subtract this x squared from this. 1So you get-- let me rewrite it --so you get x squared 1f squared over a squared minus x squared. 1And let's bring this y to this side of the equation too. 1So minus y squared. 1That's all I did, I just brought that to that side. 1And then let's bring-- and I'm kind of skipping a couple of 1steps, but I don't want to take too long --let's take this a 1and put it on that side equation. 1So we took the x and the y, we subtracted that from 1both sides of the equation. 1So they ended up on the left hand side. 1And then if we subtract a squared from both sides of this 1equation-- this is a fatiguing problem --then you get f 1squared minus a squared. 1I think we're almost there. 1This can simplify to, let's see we can factor 1out the x squared. 1This becomes f squared over a squared minus 11 times x squared. 1I just factor out the x squared there, minus y squared is equal 1to f squared, the focal length squared, minus a squared. 1And let's see, let's divide both sides of the equation by 1this expression right there, and we get-- and this should 1start to look familiar --we get f squared over a squared minus 11, x squared divided by f squared minus a squared minus y 1squared over f squared mine is a squared is equal 1. 1Right, I divided both sides by this, so I just get a 1 1on this right hand side. 1Let's see if I can simplify this. 1If I multiply the numerator and the denominator 1by a squared, right? 1As long as I multiply the numerator and the denominator 1by the same number I'm just multiplying my 1, so I'm 1not changing anything. 1So if I do that, the numerator becomes f-- if I multiply it, 1it becomes f squared minus a squared. 1I'm just multiplying that times a squared. 1And the denominator becomes a squared times f 1squared minus a squared. 1And all that times x squared. 1Minus y squared minus a squared mine is a 1squared is equal to 1. 1This cancels with this. 1And we get something to starting to look like the 1equation of a hyperbola. 1My energy is coming back! 1It seems like I see the light at the end of the tunnel. 1We get x squared over a squared minus y squared over f minus 1a squared is equal to 1. 1Now this looks a lot like our original equation of the 1hyperbola, which was x squared over a squared minus y squared 1over b squared is equal to 1. 1In fact this is equation of the hyperbola but instead set of 1writing b squared, since we wrote it, we essentially said, 1what is the locus of all points where the difference of the 1distances to those two foci is equal to 2a? 1And we just played with the algebra for while. 1It was pretty tiring, and I'm impressed if you've gotten this 1far into the video, and we got this equation, which should be 1the equation of the hyperbola, and it is the equation 1of the hyperbole. 1It is this equation. 1So this is the same thing is that. 1So f squared minus a square. 1Or the focal length squared minus a squared is 1equal to b squared. 1You add a squared to both sides, and you get f squared 1is equal to b squared plus a squared or a squared 1plus b squared. 1Which tells us that the focal length is equal to the 1square root of this. 1Of a squared plus b squared. 1And that's what we set out to figure out in the beginning. 1So hopefully you're now satisfied that the focal length 1of a hyperbola is the sum of these two denominators. 1And it's also truth if it is an upward or vertical hyperbola. 1And if we're dealing with an ellipse, it's the difference of 1these two-- the square root of the difference of 1these two numbers. 1Anyway, I'll leave you there. 1That was an exhausting problem. 1I have to go get a glass of water now.",math_precalculus_conics
" Let's say that you wanna count the days since your last birthday because you just wanna know how long its been. And so one day after your birthday you put a mark on a wall. Then the next day you put another mark on the wall. The day after that you put another mark on the wall. So out that day you say well how many days has it been? Well you can say look there's been one, two, three days. So one way to think about it is this set of symbols right over here represents the number three. But then you keep going. The fourth day, you put another mark. Fifth day, you put another mark. And then you keep going like that day after day each day you add another mark. And this is actually the earliest way, the most basic way of representing numbers. The number is represented by the number of marks. So after bunch of days you get here and you're like on well how many days has it been? Well you just recount everything. You say one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 days. So well you know this number representation it took me little bit of time to realize that this is 17 but it seems to be working so you just keep going. Day after day after day after day you just keep marking off the days on your wall just to sense you're counting the days since your last birthday. But at some point you realize every time you wanna know how may days its been to count it is a little bit painful. And not only that, is this is taking up a lot of space on your wall. You wish that there was an easier way to represent whatever number this is. So first of all let's just think about what number this actually is. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. So you wish that there was a better way to represent this number which we now call 37. And maybe when you're first trying you might have even called it something called 37. You would just call it this, this number. This number of days since my birthday. And I say well look. What if there was an easier way to group the numbers? You know I have 10 fingers on my hands. What if I were to group them into 10s? And then I would say just how many groups of 10 I have and then how many ones do I have left over. Maybe that would be an easier way to represent, to represent this quantity here. And so let's do that. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. So that's a group of 10 right over there. And then you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. So this is another group of 10 right over here. And then let's see. We have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. So that is another group of 10 right over there. And then finally you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So you don't get a whole group of 10 so you don't circle em. So just by doing this very simple thing now all of a sudden it's much easier to realize how many days have passed. You don't have to count everything. You just have to say okay. One group of 10. Two groups of 10. Three groups of 10. Or you can say one, two, three 10s. And so that's essentially 30. And then I have another one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And so you say oh I have 30 and then seven if you knew to use those words which we now use. Now this is essentially what our number system does using the 10 digits we know of. The 10 digits we know of are zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Now what our number system allows us to do is using only these 10 digits we can essentially represent any number we want in a very quick way, a very easy way for our brains to understand it. So here if we want to represent three 10s, we would have put a three in what we would call the 10s place. We would put a three in the 10s place. And then we would put the ones, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. We'd put the seven in the ones place. And so how do you know which place is which? Well the first place starting from the right, the first place is the ones place. And then you go one space to the left of it, you get to the 10s place. And as we'll see you go one more space you go to the 100s space. But we'll cover that in a future video. So this essentially tells us the exact same thing. This tells us the exact same thing as this does right over here. This tells us three 10s. One, two, three. Three 10s Three groups of 10. And then another set of ones. So we could rewrite this. This is equal to, this is equal to three 10s three 10s plus, plus seven ones. Or another way to think about it what are the three 10s? Well if use the same number system to represent three 10s you would write that down as 30. And then seven ones. Once again if you use our same number system you would represent that as seven. So these are all different ways of representing 37. And hopefully this allows you to appreciate how neat our number system is. Where even a number like 37 as soon as you just write scratches on a wall, it becomes pretty hard to read. And you can imagine when you get to much much larger numbers like 1,052 to have to count that many marks every time. But our number system gives us a way of dealing with it.",math_arithmetic-home_arith-place-value
" -  We have three different pictures here, and my question to get us warmed up is which of these could represent 20 divided by four? Pause this video and see if you can figure that out. All right, so let's go through each of these. And, actually, let's think about what each of them could represent. So how many total circles do we have in this picture right over here? Let's see, we have one, two, three, four, and then we have four groups of four. So four, eight, 12, 16. So this looks like 16 circles. 16 circles divided into, we could do it as divided into groups of four, or we could actually also view it as divided into four equal groups, because both of those are true. And we see that that is going to be equal to four. So this one over here, it's really representing 16 divided by four, not 20 divided by four. Now, what about this one? Let's see, here, it looks like we have one, two, three, four, five groups of one, two, three, four, five. So this looks like 25 circles divided into groups of five, or divided into five equals groups, which is, of course, equal to five. So this is 25 divided by five, not 20 divided by four. Now, but what about this one? So let's see, we have one, two, three, four, five, and we have, one, two, three, four groups of five. So five, 10, 15, 20. So we definitely have 20 circles there. And we have divided it into four equal groups. We have divided it into four equal groups, and so that's exactly what we're talking about, or what we started talking about. This is 20 divided by four. And you can see, when you take 20 and divide it into four equal groups, then you get one, two, three, four, five circles per group. And we're done.",math_arithmetic_arith-review-multiply-divide
" -  The graph of F is shown below. A total of 24 right hand rectangles are shown. So, what do I mean by right hand rectangles? So, there's clearly 24 rectangles. You can count them. And right hand rectangle means that for each of these rectangles the height of the rectangle is defined by the value of the function on the right hand side of the rectangle. So you can see this is the right hand side of this first rectangle and if you take the value of the function of that point that is the height of the rectangle. A left hand rectangle would define the height of the rectangle by the value of the function on the left hand side of the rectangle. So, a left handed rectangle's height, the first rectangle's height would look like that. That's what they mean by right handed rectangle Fair enough, eight in blue. We see that. 16 in red. All right. All 24 of the rectangles have the same width. Which of the statements below is or are true? They give us three expressions in sigma notation and they say, like this first one is the sum of the areas of the blue rectangles. This is the sum of the areas of the red rectangles. This is the sum of the areas of all of the rectangles. So, I encourage you now to pause the video and try to determine on your own, which of the statements is or are true. So, I assume you've had a go at it. Let's just go through each of these and see whether they make sense. So this first one, the sum of the areas of the blue rectangles. Well, we know we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight blue rectangles, and we're summing from one to eight. So it seems like we're summing eight things right over here. This is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So, this is looking good right over here. And then we take F of something times one half. So, we're not even looking at this yet. It looks like this would be the height of each of the rectangles. Remember, we're taking the value of the function on the right hand side for the height, and this would be the width. So does it make sense that the width of each of these rectangles is one half? Well, the total distance between X equals negative five and X equals seven, that distance is 12. Five plus seven, that's 12, and we're dividing it into 24 rectangles of equal width. So, if you divide 12 divided by 24 each of these are going to have a width of one half. So this is checking out that the one half. Now let's think about this part. Let's think about the F of negative five plus I over two. So, let's see. When I is equal to one, so we're going to take one half times F of negative five plus one over two. Right? I is one. So negative five plus one half is going to get us to this point right over here. F of that is going to be this distance, this height right over here. This is consistent with these being right handed rectangles. So, this is definitely the case. When I is equal to one we're definitely finding this area right over here. When I is equal to two it's going to be negative five plus two over two. So two over two, we're going to add one, we're going to go over here. So once again we're doing one half, which is this right over here. That's the width times F of negative five plus two over two, which is F of negative four, which is this height right over here. So, once again that is that area. You can keep following it. Everytime we're taking the function this first one is negative five plus one half, and then for each increment we're adding a half to I guess the right hand side is one way to think about it. So, this actually makes complete sense. We're doing this for the first eight so this is indeed true. This is the sum of the areas of the blue rectangles. Now let's look at this one over here. The sum of the areas of the red rectangles. At first this looks pretty interesting. We're taking the sum of 16 things, and we do indeed have 16 things right over here. We have the width of each of those 16 things or for each of those things we want to figure out an area, and it is indeed the case that each of these has a width of one half. But what happens when we take F of negative one plus I over two. So, we're starting right over here at negative one. Negative one plus I over two. When I equals one we're going to be at this point right over here, and F of that is going to be -- You might say, ""Hey, isn't that going to be the height of that rectangle? When I equals two isn't it going to be the height of that rectangle? And when I is equal to three isn't it going to be the height of that rectangle?"" And that's where we have to be very careful. They're going to have the same absolute value, but these are going to be these are all going to be negative values. These are all going to be negative because we see between this value of our function. So that looks like between negative one half all the way to seven our function is actually negative. So one way to think about it, you'd be having negative height so when you multiply these two things you're going to get a negative number. So this whole thing is going to be a negative number and so you're essentially going to get the negative of the sums of the areas of the red rectangles, but that's not the same thing as the sum of the areas of the red rectangles. An area is, at least in the traditional sense, you would expect to have, if you were just seeing what's the area how much carpet you would need to cover this someone would say that will be a positive value. But this is going to be a negative version of that. So that is not the sum of the areas of the areas of the red rectangles. It's the negative of the areas of the red rectangles. So we'd rule that one out. Then this last choice. So, this expression is the sum of the areas of all the rectangles. And so this one is going from I equals one to 24. So it's literally 24 things. It's starting here and it just keeps going. And if this said from I equals one to I equals eight it would be the first choice, but then this falls into the problem again of once we get past, when we get to I equal nine this thing right over here will turn negative, and it's going to give the negative area. So it's essentially going to net out this positive area against this negative area right over here. So it's not the sum of the areas of all the rectangles. It's going to be this area essentially minus this area right over there.",math_old-integral-calculus_riemann-sums-ic
" -  So we have here f of x being equal to the natural log of the square root of x. And what we wanna do in this video is find the derivative of f. And the key here is to recognize that f can actually be viewed as a composition of two functions. And we can diagram that out, what's going on here? Well if you input an x into our function f, what's the first thing that you do? Well, you take the square root of it. So if we start off with some x, you input it, the first thing that you do, you take the square root of it. You are going to take the square root of the input to produce the square root of x, and then what do you do? You take the square root and then you take the natural log of that. So then you take the natural log of that, so you could view that as inputting it into another function that takes the natural log of whatever is inputted in. I'm making these little squares to show what you do with the input. And then what do you produce? Well you produce the natural log of the square root of x. Natural log of the square root of x. Which is equal to f of x. So you could view f of x as this entire set, or this entire, I guess you could say, this combination of functions right over there. That is f of x, which is essentially, a composition of two functions. You're inputting into one function then taking that output and inputting it into another. So you could have a function u here, which takes the square root of whatever its input is, so u of x is equal to the square root of x. And then you take that output, and input it into another function that we could call v, and what does v do? Well it take the natural log of whatever the input is. In this case, in the case of f, or in the case of how I just diagrammed it, v is taking the natural log, the input happens to be square root of x, so it outputs the natural log of the square root of x. If we wanted to write v with x as an input, we would just say well that's the natural log, that is just the natural log of x. And as you can see here, f of x, and I color-coded ahead of time, is equal to, f of x is equal to, the natural log of the square root of x. So that is v of the square root of x, or v of u of x. So it is a composition which tells you that, okay, if I'm trying to find the derivative here, the chain rule is going to be very, very, very, very useful. And the chain rule tells us that f prime of x is going to be equal to the derivative of, you can view it as the outside function, with respect to this inside function, so it's going to be v prime of u of x, v prime of u of x, times the derivative of this inside function with respect to x. So that's just u prime, u prime of x. So how do we evaluate these things? Well, we know how to take the derivative of u of x and v of x, u prime of x here, is going to be equal to, well remember, square root of x is just the same thing as x to 1/2 power, so we can use the power rule, bring the 1/2 out from so it becomes 1/2 x to the, and then take off one out of that exponent, so that's 1/2 minus one is negative 1/2 power. And what is v of x, sorry, what is v prime of x? Well the derivative of the natural log of x is one over x, we show that in other videos. And so we now know what u prime of x is, we know what v prime of x is, but what is v prime of u of x? Well v prime of u of x, wherever we see the x, we replace it, let me write that a little bit neater, we replace that with a u of x, so v prime of u of x is going to be equal to, is going to be equal to one over u of x, one over u of x, which is equal to, which is equal to one over, u of x is just the square root of x. One over the square root of x. This thing right over here, we have figured out, is one over the square root of x, and this thing, u prime of x, we figured out, is 1/2 times x to the negative 1/2, and x to the negative 1/2, I could rewrite that as 1/2 times one over x to the 1/2, which is the same thing as 1/2 times one over the square root of x, or I could write that as one over 2 square roots of x. So what is this thing going to be? Well this is going to be equal to, in green, v prime of u of x is one over the square root of x, times, times, u prime of x is one over two times the square root of x, now what is this going to be equal to? Well, this is going to be equal to, this is just algebra at this point, one over, we have our two and square root of x times square root of x is just x. So it just simplifies to one over two x. So hopefully this made sense, and I intentionally diagrammed it out so that you start to get that muscle in your brain going of recognizing the composite functions, and then making a little bit more sense of some of these expressions of the chain rule that you might see in your calculus class, or in your calculus textbook. But as you get more practice, you'll be able to do it, essentially, without having to write out all of this. You'll say okay, look, I have a composition. This is the natural log of the square root of x, this is v of u of x. So what I wanna do is I wanna take the derivative of this outside function with respect to this inside function. So the derivative of natural log of something, with respect to that something, is one over that something. So it is one over that something, the derivative natural log of something with respect to that something is one over that something, so that's what we just did here. One way to think about it, what would natural log of x be? Well that'd be one over x, but it's not natural log of x. It's one over square root of x, so it's going to be one over the square root of x, so you take the derivative of the outside function with respect to the inside one, and then you multiply that times just the derivative of the inside function with respect to x. And we are done.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-continuity-differentiability
" -  We are told that a baker uses eight cups of flour to make one batch of muffins for his bakery. Complete the table for the given ratio. So they're saying that for every batch, he needs eight cups of flour or he needs eight cups of flour for every batch. So if you have two batches how many cups of flour would that be? Pause the video and try to figure it out. Well if he has twice as many batches, he's gonna have twice the number of cups of flour. So instead of eight, it would be 16 cups of flour. And if he had three times the number of batches, it would be three times the number of cups of flour. So instead of eight, it would be eight times three, or 24. Now down here, they say plot the ordered pairs x comma y from the table on the following graph. So we wanna graph one batch, eight cups, two batches, 16 cups, three batches, 24 cups. So let's do that. Let's see if we can, okay. So right here, I'm assuming on the horizontal axis that is our batches, and then our vertical axis is cups of flour. So for every batch, we need eight cups of flour. So one batch, this is eight right over here, five, six, seven, eight, and then for two batches, we're going to need 16 cups of flour so that puts us right over there, that's 16. And then for three batches, we are going to need 24 cups of flour, and that actually goes slightly off of our screen here, let me scroll up a little bit. So for three batches, we're going to have to bring that to 24 which is right here and I can see the 25 right above that. And what you'll see, because the ratio between our batches and our cups of flour are constant, that all of these points, you could connect them all with one straight line because we have a fixed ratio. Every time we move one to the right, we're gonna move eight up. Every time we add another batch, we're gonna have eight more cups of flour, every time we add a batch, eight more cups of flour. Lets do another example. Here we're told Drew earns money washing cars for his neighbors on the weekends. Drew charges a set rate for each car he washes. The points on the following coordinate plane show how much Drew charges for two, five, and eight cars. So let's see what's going on over here. So when he washes two cars, he looks like he charges $15. When he washes five cars, it looks like he's charging, well it looks like some place between 35 and $40, and he charges eight cars, it looks like he's charging $60. So one way to think about it is the ratio between the number of cars he's washing and the dollars, it stays at two to 15, notice two cars, for every $15. I guess I could say $15 for every two cars. And so, when you go to eight cars, you're multiplying by four the number of cars and you're also multiplying by four the number of dollars. And so once again, since we have a fixed ratio here, all three of these points sit on the same line. But then they ask us down here, they say how much does Drew charge for four cars? Well if it's $15 for two cars, well then four cars would be twice as much. So it would be $30 for four cars. We have the same ratio. Let's do one more example. Here we're told McKenna earns money each time she shovels snow for her neighbors, as she should. McKenna plots points on the coordinate plane below to show how much she earns for different numbers of times she shovels snow. Alright. So let's see, when she shovels snow three times, looks like she gets, halfway between 16 and 20, looks like she gets $18, four times, looks like it's $24, so looks like the ratio is staying constant at three to 18. The ratio of three to 18 is the same thing as, one way to think about it is $18 for every three times she shovels snow, that would be equivalent of six dollars for every time she shovels snow. So let's go down here to see what they're asking us. They say which of the following ordered pairs could McKenna add to the graph? So this would be one times she shoveling snow, would she get $10 for it. So does she get $10 for every time she shovels snow? No, that wouldn't be consistent with the data here. She got $18 for shoveling snow three times. So that looks like she's getting six dollars for every time she shovels snow. So I would rule out choice A, choice B, shoveling snow twice, she gets $12. Well that makes sense, if she gets six dollars every time she shovels snow. If the ratio of shoveling of the times to the dollars is three to 18 or one to six, that would be equivalent to two to 12 and we would pick that choice.",math_6th-grade-illustrative-math_unit-6-expressions-and-equations
" -  It is election season, and there is a runoff between candidate A versus candidate B. And we are pollsters. And we're interested in figuring out, well, what's the likelihood that candidate A wins this election? Well, ideally, we would go to the entire population of likely voters right over here, let's say there's 100,000 likely voters, and we would ask every one of the them, who do you support? And from that, we would be able to get the population proportion, which would be, this is the proportion that support, support candidate A. But it might not be realistic. In fact, it definitely will not be realistic to ask, well, all 100,000 people. So instead, we do the thing that we tend to do in statistics is, is that we sample this population, and we calculate a statistic from that sample in order to estimate this parameter. So let's say we take a sample right over here. So this sample size, let's say n equals 100. And we calculate the sample proportion that support candidate A. So out of the 100, let's say that 54 say that they're going to support candidate A. So the sample proportion here is 0.54. And just to appreciate that we're not always going to get 0.54, there could've been a situation where we sampled a different 100, and we would've maybe gotten a different sample proportion. Maybe in that one, we got 0.58. And we already have the tools in statistics to think about this, the distribution of the possible sample proportions we could get. We've talked about it when we thought about sampling distributions. So you could have the sampling distribution of the sample proportions, of the sample proportions, proportions. And it's going, this distribution's going to be specific to what our sample size is, for n is equal to 100. And so we can describe the possible sample proportions we could get and their likelihoods with this sampling distribution. So let me do that. So it would look something like this. Because our sample size is so much smaller than the population, it's way less than 10%, we can assume that each person we're asking, that it's approximately independent. Also, if we make the assumption that the true proportion isn't too close to zero or not too close to one, then we can say that, well, look, this sampling distribution is roughly going to be normal. So we'll have a normal, this kind of bell curve shape. And we know a lot about the sampling distribution of the sample proportions. We know already, for example, and if this is foreign to you, I encourage you to watch the videos on this on Khan Academy, that the mean of this sampling distribution is going to be the actual population proportion. And we also know what the standard deviation of this is going to be. So, let me, maybe that's one standard deviation. This is two standard deviations. That's three standard deviations above the mean. That's one standard deviation, two standard deviations, three standard deviations below the mean. So this distance, let me do this in a different color, this standard deviation right over here, which we denote as the standard deviation of the sample proportions, for this sampling distribution, this is, we've already seen the formula there. It's the square root of p times one minus p, where p is, once again, our population proportion divided by our sample size. That's why it's specific for n equals 100 here. And so in this first scenario, let's just focus on this one right over here, when we took a sample size of n equals 100 and we got the sample proportion of 0.54, we could've gotten all sorts of outcomes here. Maybe 0.54 is right over here. Maybe 0.54 is right over here. And the reason why I had this uncertainty is we actually don't know what the real population parameter is, what the real population proportion is. But let me ask you maybe a slightly easier question. What is, what is the probability, probability that our sample proportion of 0.54 is within, is within two times two standard deviations of p? Pause the video, and think about that. Well, that's just saying, look, if I'm gonna take a sample and calculate the sample proportion right over here, what's the probability that I'm within two standard deviations of the mean? Well, that's essentially going to be this area right over here. And we know, from studying normal curves, that approximately 95% of the area is within two standard deviations. So this is approximately 95%. 95% of the time that I take a sample size of 100 and I calculate this sample proportion, 95% of the time, I'm going to be within two standard deviations. But if you take this statement, you can actually construct another statement that starts to feel a little bit more, I guess we could say inferential. We could say there, there is a 95% probability that the population proportion p is within, within two standard deviations, two standard deviations of p-hat, which is equal to 0.54. Pause this video. Appreciate that these two are equivalent statements. If there's a 95% chance that our sample proportion is within two standard deviations of the true proportion, well, that's equivalent to saying that there's a 95% chance that our true proportion is within two standard deviations of our sample proportion. And this is really, really interesting because if we were able to figure out what this value is, well, then we would be able to create what you could call a confidence interval. Now, you immediately might be seeing a problem here. In order to calculate this, our standard deviation of this distribution, we have to know our population parameter. So pause this video, and think about what we would do instead. If we don't know what p is here, if we don't know our population proportion, do we have something that we could use as an estimate for our population proportion? Well, yes, we calculated p-hat already. We calculated our sample proportion. And so a new statistic that we could define is the standard error, the standard error of our sample proportions. And we can define that as being equal to, since we don't know the population proportion, we're going to use the sample proportion, p-hat times one minus p-hat, all of that over n. In this case, of course, n is 100. We do know that. And it actually turns out, I'm not going to prove it in this video, that this actually is an unbiased estimator for this right over here. So this is going to be equal to 0.54 times one minus 0.54, so it's 0.46, all of that over 100. So we have the square root of .54 times .46 divided by 100, close my parentheses, Enter. So if I round to the nearest hundredth, it's going to be, actually, even if I round to the nearest thousandth, it's going to be approximately 5/100. So this is going to be, this is approximately 0.05. So another way to say all of these things is, instead, we don't know exactly this, but now we have an estimate for it. So we could now say with 95% confidence, and that will often be known as our confidence level right over here, with 95% confidence between, between, and so we'd want to go two standard errors below our sample proportion that we just happened to calculate. So that would be 0.54 minus two times 5/100. So that would be 0.54 minus 10/100, which would be 0.44. And we'd also want to go two standard errors above the sample proportion. So that would be that plus 10/100. And 0.64 of voters, of voters support, support A. And so this interval that we have right over here, from 0.44 to 0.64, this will be known as our confidence interval, confidence interval. And this will change, not just in the starting point and the end point, but it will change the actual length of our confidence interval, will change depending on what sample proportion we happened to pick for that sample of 100. A related idea to the confidence interval is this notion of margin of error, margin of error. And for this particular case, for this particular sample, our margin of error, because we care about 95% confidence, so that would be two standard errors. So our margin of error here is two times our standard error, would just be 0.1 or 0.10. And so we're going one margin of error above our sample proportion right over here 1and one margin of error 1below our sample proportion right over here 1to define our confidence interval. 1And as I mentioned, this margin of error is not going 1to be fixed every time we take a sample. 1Depending on what our sample proportion is, 1it's going to affect our margin of error 1because that is calculated, essentially, 1with the standard error. 1Another interpretation of this is 1that the method that we used 1to get this interval right over here, 1the method that we used to get this confidence, 1to get this confidence interval, 1when we use it over and over, 1it will produce intervals, 1and the intervals won't always be the same. 1It's gonna be dependent on our sample proportion, 1but it will produce intervals 1which include the true proportion, 1which we might not know and often don't know. 1It'll include the true proportion 95% of the time. 1I'll cover that intuition more in future videos. 1We'll see how the interval changes, 1how the margin of error changes. 1But when you do this calculation 1over and over and over again, 195% of the time, 1your true proportion is going to be contained 1in whatever interval you happen to calculate that time. 1Now, another interesting question is, 1is, well, what if you wanted to 1tighten up the intervals on average? 1How would you do that? 1Well, if you wanted to lower your margin of error, 1the best way to lower the margin of error 1is if you increase this denominator right over here. 1And increasing that denominator means 1increasing the sample size. 1And so one thing that you will often see 1when people are talking about election coverage is, 1well, we need to sample more people 1in order to get a lower margin of error. 1But I'll leave you there, 1and I'll see you in future videos.",math_statistics-probability_confidence-intervals-one-sample
" We are told that the formula for finding the perimeter of a rectangle is P is equal to 2l plus 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width. And just to visualize what they're saying, and you might already be familiar with this, let me draw a rectangle. That looks like a rectangle. And if this side's length is l, then this side's length is also going to be l. And if this width is w, then this width up here is w. And the perimeter is just how, what is the distance if you were to go around this rectangle? And so, that distance is going to be this w plus this l, plus this w-- or that width-- plus this length. And if you have 1 w and you add it to another w, that's going to give you 2 w's. So that's 2 w's. And then if you have 1 l, and then you have another l, that's going to give you, if you add them together, that's going to give you 2 l's. So the perimeter is going to be 2 l's plus 2 w's. They just wrote it in a different order than the way I wrote it. But the same thing, so hopefully that makes sense. Now, their question is, rewrite the formula so that it solves for width. So the formula, the way it's written now, it says P is equal to something. They want us to write it so it's, this w, right here, they want it to be w is equal to a bunch of stuff with l's and P's in it, and maybe some numbers there. So let's think about how we can do this. So they tell us that P is equal to 2 times l, plus 2 times w. We want to solve for w. Well, a good starting point might be to get rid of the l on this side of the equation. And to get rid of it on that side of the equation, we could subtract the 2l from both sides of the equation. So let's do it this way. So you subtract 2l over here. Minus 2l. You're also going to have to do that on the left-hand side. So you're going to have minus 2l. We're doing it on both sides of the equation. And remember, an equation says P is equal to that, so if you do anything to that, you have to do it to P. So if you subtract 2l from this, you're going to have to subtract 2l from P in order for the equality to keep being true. So the left-hand side is going to be P minus 2l, and then that is going to be equal to-- well, 2l minus 2l, the whole reason why we subtracted 2l is because these are going to cancel out. So these cancel out, and you're just left with a 2w here. You're just left with a 2w. We're almost there. We've almost solved for w. To finish it up, we just have to divide both sides of this equation by 2. And the whole reason why I'm dividing both sides of this equation by 2 is to get rid of this 2 coefficient, this 2 that's multiplying w. So if you divide both sides of this equation by 2, once again, if you do something to one side of the equation, you do it to the other side. The whole reason why I divided the right-hand side by 2 is 2 times anything divided by 2 is just going to be that anything, so this is going to be a w. And then we have our left-hand side. So we're done. If we flip these two sides, we have our w will be equal to this thing over here-- equals P minus 2l, all of that over 2. Now, this is the correct answer. There's other ways to write it, though. You might want to rewrite this, so let me square this off, because this is completely the correct answer. This is the correct answer, but there's other ways that you might have been able to get this answer, other expressions for this answer. You might have also, you know, another completely legitimate way to do this problem-- let me write it this way-- so our original problem is P is equal to 2l plus 2w-- is on this right-hand side, what if we factor out a 2? So let me make this clear. You have a 2 here, and you have a 2 here. So you could imagine undistributing the 2. So we would get P is equal to 2 times l plus w. This is an equally legitimate way to do this problem. Now, we can divide both sides of this equation by 2, so that we get rid of this 2 on the right-hand side. So if you divide both sides of this equation by 2, these 2's are going to cancel out-- 2 times anything divided by 2 is just going to be the anything-- is equal to P over 2. So let me just rewrite this over here. Let me just rewrite this. So we will get P over 2 is going to be equal to l plus w. And then if we want to solve for w, we just subtract l from both sides. And sometimes, you know, you could write it in a separate line like this. Sometimes you could just write it like this. You could say, I'm going to subtract an l on that side. If I do it on that side, I have to do it on this side, too. That's the same thing as adding a negative l. And so the right-hand side, you're just left with a w. And then the left-hand side, you're going to have, it could be a negative l plus P over 2, or you could just change the order, and you can write this as P over 2 minus l. And this is also an equally legitimate answer. And you're probably saying, hey Sal, wait. These things look different. P minus 2l over 2, that looks different than P over 2 minus l. And they're not. Think about this. We could rewrite this as P-- let me do this with the same colors-- this over here is the same thing as P over 2 minus 2l over 2. Right? If I have a minus b and they're both being divided by 2, I can just separate-- you can imagine I'm distributing the division by 2 right over here. And over here, 2 times l divided by 2, that's just an l. So this is going to be equal to P over 2 minus l, which is the exact same thing as this right there.",math_algebra-home_alg-modeling
" A ball is shot into the air from the edge of a building, 50 feet above the ground. Its initial velocity is 20 feet per second. The equation h-- and I'm guessing h is for height-- is equal to negative 16t squared plus 20t plus 50 can be used to model the height of the ball after t seconds. And I think in this problem they just want us to accept this formula, although we do derive formulas like this and show why it works for this type of problem in the Khan Academy physics playlist. But for here, we'll just go with the flow on this example. So they give us the equation that can be used to model the height of the ball after t seconds, and then say about how long does it take for the ball to hit the ground. So if this is the height, the ground is when the height is equal to 0. So hitting the ground means-- this literally means that h is equal to 0. So we need to figure out at which times does h equal 0. So we're really solving the equation 0 is equal to negative 16t squared plus 20t plus 50. And if you want to simplify this a little bit-- let's see, everything here is divisible at least by 2. And let's divide everything by negative 2, just so that we can get rid of this negative leading coefficient. So you divide the left hand side by negative 2, you still get a 0. Negative 16 divided by negative 2 is 8. So 8t squared. 20 divided by negative 2 is negative 10. Minus 10t. 50 divided by negative 2 is minus 25. And so we have 8t squared minus 10t minus 25 is equal to 0. Or if you're comfortable with this on the left hand side, we can put on the left hand side. We could just say this is equal to 0. And now we solve. And we could complete this square here, or we can just apply the quadratic formula, which is derived from completing the square. And we have this in standard form. We know that this is our a. This right over here is our b. And this over here is our c. And the quadratic formula tells us that the roots-- and in this case, it's in terms of the variable t-- are going to be equal to negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac, all of that over 2a. So if we apply it, we get t is equal to negative b. b is negative 10. So negative negative 10 is going to be positive 10. Plus or minus the square root of negative 10 squared. Well, that's just positive 100, minus 4 times a, which is 8, times c, which is negative 25. And all of that over 2a. a Is 8. So 2 times 8 is 16. And this over here, we have a-- let's see if we can simplify this a little bit. The negative sign, negative times a negative, these are going to be positive. 4 times 25 is 100, times 8 is 800. So all that simplifies to 800. And we have 100 plus 800 under the radical sign. So this is equal to 10 plus or minus the square root of 900, all of that over 16. And this is equal to 10 plus or minus-- square root of 900 is 30-- over 16. And so we get time is equal to 10 plus 30 over 16, is 40 over 16, which is the same thing if we divide the numerator and denominator by 4 to simplify it as 10 over-- or actually even better, divide it by 8-- that's 5 over 2. So that's one solution, if we add the 30. If we subtract the 30, we'd get 10 minus 30. Or t is equal to 10 minus 30, which is negative 20 over 16. Divide the numerator and the denominator by 4, you get negative 5 over 4. Now, we have to remember, we're trying to find a time. And so a time, at least in this problem that we're dealing with, we should only think about positive times. We want to figure out how much time has taken-- how long does it take for the ball to hit the ground? We don't want to go back in time. So we don't want our negative answer right here. So we only want to think about our positive answer. And so this tells us that the only root that should work is 5/2. And we assume that this is in seconds. So this is in 5/2 seconds. I wouldn't worry too much about the physics here. I think they really just want us to apply the quadratic formula to this modeling situation. The physics, we go into a lot more depth and give you the conceptual understanding on our physics playlist. But let's verify that we definitely are at a height of 0 at 5/2 seconds, or t is equal to 5/2. This expression right over here does give us h is equal to 0. So we have-- let's try it out. We have negative 16 times 5/2 squared plus 20 times 5/2 plus 50. This needs to be equal to 0. So this is negative 16 times 25/4 plus-- let's see, if we divide 20 by 2, we get 10. If we divide 2 by 2, we get 1. So 10 times 5 is going to be 50. Plus 50. This needs to be equal to 0. Negative 16 divided by 4 is negative 4. 4 divided by 4 is 1. So you have negative 4 times 25, which is 100. Plus 50-- oh, sorry. Negative 4 times 25 is negative 100. Plus 50, plus 50 again is equal to 0. And so we have negative 100 plus another 100. Well, that's definitely going to be equal to 0. We get 0 equals 0. And it all checks out. We hit the ground after 5/2 seconds. Or another way to think about it is 2.5 seconds. t is equal to 5/2 seconds, or 2.5 seconds.",math_algebra-home_alg-quadratics
" This brain teaser in this video is once again not one that I made up. I actually don't remember the first time that I heard it. I think it was in the back of a magazine. I want to say Scientific American. And me and a bunch of buddies, we were traveling through Europe. And it kind of became our pastime to do these brain teasers in the back of magazines. And just so you know, I think a lot of you think that these type of brain teasers, you can just read them and solve them. And if you can't solve them, then you're not good at this type of thing. This brain teaser I'm about to give you, I just kind of sat and thought about it, and me and my buddies, we argued about it for literally about a day. And then I just slept on it. And then first thing in the morning, I woke up all my friends, I was like, I figured it out! So this isn't some kind of easy thing. And I encourage you, just listen to the statement, understand it, and then pause the video. And then think about it for 24 hours. And then come back to it. One, you'll probably solve it yourself. And if you don't, in 24 or 48 hours, then you'll probably find the solution that much more satisfying. So this is the problem of the togglers. Not toddlers. Togglers. I have an infant, so words like toddler are in my brain. But this is the problem of the togglers. So there are five guys in front of you. That's one of them. Two. Three. Four. Five. They don't have to be guys. They can be of any gender. And four of them are what we call togglers. So four of them. Four togglers. And what a toggler does is, the first time you ask them a question, they're either going to tell the truth or they're going to lie. So truth or a lie. But then the second time that you ask them, they're going to toggle. They're going to switch. So the second time you ask them a question, if they told the truth the first time, then the next time you ask that same person a question, they're going to switch to lying. But if they lied the first time you asked them a question, then they're going to switch to telling the truth. And then it goes on, and so on, and so forth. So if you ask the same person the third question, if they told the truth the first time, then they'll lie the second time you ask them a question, and then the third time they'll tell the truth again. It's like, if I was a toggler and you said, hey you, what is your name? And if I said, oh my name is Bill. Then clearly I'm lying that first time. And then you pointed to me again, and you say, what is your name? And I say, oh my name is Sal. And if you ask me again, what is your name? I would say, oh, my name is Susan. And if you ask me again, my name is Sal. So the first time, I just decided to lie. But just as easily, I could've decided to tell the truth the first time. You might have said, hey you, what's your name? I would have said, Sal. And then you ask me, what's your name again? And I would have said Elizabeth. And then you ask me, what's my name again? I would say, oh, my name is Sal. And then again, what's your name? And I would say, you know, George Washington or something arbitrary. But I think you get the idea. A toggler-- I don't know who's a toggler. Let's say that this is a toggler. The first time you ask them a question, they might lie, they might tell the truth. But if they lie, the next time you ask the same person a question, they're going to tell the truth. But the first time you ask them a question, and they did tell the truth, the next time you ask the same person a question, he or she is going to lie. So that's a toggler. So you can already imagine, this is-- I don't know. The first time that I read the problem it kind of made my brain hurt. This notion of a toggler. It's much easier when there's a reality where people only lie or only tell the truth. It's much harder when they toggle. And not only do they toggle, but their initial state, whether they start telling the truth or they start off lying. You don't know. That's arbitrary. There's no way of predicting whether this person-- First of all, we don't know if this person is a toggler, because I said there's only four togglers. But even if they are toggler, I don't even know if the first time I ask them a question whether they're going to tell the truth or whether they're going to lie. So four of them are togglers. What's the fifth? Well, you probably could guess because this is how these brain teasers go. The fifth is a truth teller. And he is much simpler. Or he or she. I don't want to give any clues on who it might be. Is a truth teller. And a truth teller always tells the truth. So the goal of this brain teaser is to figure out who is the truth teller. So you want to know which of these five people is-- So let's say, goal. Who's truth teller? And as you can imagine, you don't have infinite questions to do this with. You have exactly two questions to do this with. And you have two questions. And those two questions, they can be one question to this guy and another question to this guy. Both questions could be to this guy. Both questions could be to her right over there. So the questions don't have to be to the same person, although they can be to the same person. Or they could be to two different people. So you have two questions. Any question to ask of any combination of either two questions to one person or two questions to two people. And by the end of those two questions, you should know for sure who is the truth teller. And that is the brain teaser statement. So pause it now if you don't want any hints or the solution, or anything else. So I encourage you to pause it and think about it for at least a day. And sleep on it. Because a lot of the real math problems or logic problems that are worth solving aren't the ones that you can solve right when you see them. They're the ones where you kind of sit and let your brain do a little background processing while you sleep. So that said, hopefully you've stopped it and now you've resumed it after really struggling with this for a long period. Not eating and sleeping and all the things that normal people do. And now you're ready for the solution. Or even better, you're ready to confirm your solution. So first I'll give you a hint. I mean, it's a tough question. I struggled with this at first. I was like, when you ask someone a question how do you know if they're lying or not? How do you know if they're the truth teller? How do you know if they're a toggler? You don't have any information. So the crux of this problem is, essentially, it doesn't matter who you're asking the question to the first time around. And actually the solution is that it doesn't matter who you're asking the question to the second time around. You want to ask a question so that no matter what they say, you know what they're going to do the second time around. You know whether they're going to tell the truth the second time around, or you know whether they're going to lie the second time around. And that's a hint. And if you just want a hint and then to keep thinking about it, pause it again. Because I'm about to give you the solution. So question one. And you can pick any of the five people to ask this question to. And that's kind of the nature of one of these solutions. There's no reason for you to pick one of the five over the other. They're all equally likely to be the truth teller. So you ask them, are you the truth teller? So let's think about a couple of-- Well first of all, they're either going to answer to this, yes or no. So there could be two situations. They're either going to say yes, or they're going to say no. So if someone says yes to are they the truth teller, it means that either they are the truth teller telling the truth. Or they are a lying toggler. If they say that they are not the truth teller, they clearly cannot be the truth teller, because the truth teller cannot lie about not being the truth teller. And so they have to be a toggler. And they'd be an honest toggler. They'd be a toggler who's telling the truth. Right? So it would be a truthful toggler. Remember, I ask anybody, any of these five people right here, say, are you the truth teller? If they say yes, I immediately know that they're either the truth teller telling the truth, or they're a lying toggler. If they say no, I know that they are a truthful toggler. Now, what's interesting is, in this scenario, if they say yes, what do I know that they're going to do next? So if this is the truth teller, and they told the truth, on the second question, they're going to tell the truth again. They're going to tell the truth on question number two. If they're the lying toggler, what are they going to do when you ask them another question? Well, they toggle. If they lie the first time you ask them, they're going to tell the truth the second time you ask them. So they're going to tell the truth on question number two. So if the person says yes to, are you the truth teller? You immediately know that no matter who they are, that they're going to tell the truth on question number two. So if you can know for a fact that the person's going to tell the truth on question number two, you ask them, who is the truth teller? So this is number two. Who is the truth teller? So it's kind of weird. You go to someone and say, are you the truth teller? And they'll say yes. And then you ask them again, who's the truth teller? And then, because they have to tell the truth, they will actually either say, if it was this case, they'd say I am the truth teller. Or if it's this case, they'd say no, that dude over there is the truth teller. And then you'll know who the truth teller is. 1Now what happens in this situation? 1That they're a truthful toggler? 1Well on the second question, what are they going to do? 1They're going to lie. 1They're going to lie on the second question, right? 1On question number two. 1So if you know for a fact that someone's going to lie, how 1can you phrase a question so you can figure out who the 1truth teller is? 1Well, if they say no to this first question, and you know 1they're going to lie on the second one, your second 1question should just be, who is not the truth teller? 1So the only way to lie on this question-- and this person has 1to lie now-- is to tell you who the truth teller is. 1And so, using the first question, are 1you the truth teller? 1We can immediately predict what the person's going to do 1on the second question. 1And then we can phrase the second question, depending on 1that response, to definitely know who the truth teller is. 1Anyway, I thought you'd enjoy that. 1And hopefully you see why the liar game show brain teaser 1was a bit of a warm up for this one. 1See you in the next video.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_puzzles
" We're asked to round 152, 137, 245, and 354 to the nearest 100, which is another way of saying round each of these numbers to the nearest multiple of 100. So let's think about them one by one. So let's draw a number line here. And here I'm counting up by hundreds. What I've marked here, 100, 200, 300, 400, these are all multiples of 100. I could keep going up. I could go to 500, 600, so on and so forth. Now, let's start with 152. Well, where does 152 sit? So halfway in between is 150. 152 is going to be right to the right of that. So that's 152 right over here. So what are our two options? We might round up. The multiple of 100 above 152 is 200. The multiple of 100 below 152 is 100. So which direction do we go in? Do we round up to 200, or do we round down to 100? Well, if we're rounding to the nearest 100, we want to look at one place to the right of that. We want to look at the tens place to decide which multiple of 100 it is closer to. And the rules are very similar to when we're rounding to the nearest tens place or really any place. We look one place to the right of it. So in this case, we look at the tens place. And we say, if this is 5 or larger, we round up. And this is 5 or larger, so we're going to round up to 200. So this we're going to round. 152, we're going to round to 200, which also makes sense. 152 is a little bit closer to 200. It's 48 away from to 200 than it to 100. It's 52 away from 100. So it makes sense to go up to the nearest multiple of 100. Now, let's think about 137. And I encourage you to now pause the video and try to round each of these other three numbers to the nearest 100. Well, 137 is going to sit someplace right over here. 137 is going to be right over there. So two options-- we can round down to 100. That's the multiple of 100 below 137. Or we could round up to 200. Well, 137, just looking at it, is clearly closer to 100. Or we could apply our rule. If we're rounding to the nearest 100, we want to look at one place to the right of that. We want to look at the tens place. If this is 5 or larger, we round up. If it's less than 5, we round down. So in this case, we would round down to 100. Let's do the same thing with 245. If you haven't paused it and tried it yourself, once again, I want to emphasize. That'll make it really valuable for you to try it on your own. So let's plot where 245 is. So 245 is right around-- this is 250, so 245 might be right around here. Now, let's apply that rule. If we're trying to round to the nearest 100, we would look to one place to the right. We'll look at the tens place. We could ignore the ones place. We look at the tens place here. If it is greater than or equal to 5, we round up. If it is less than 5, we round down. So here, we're clearly going to round down. And when we round down, we're going to round down to the multiple of 100 that's directly below 245. Well, we're going to round down to 200. We had two options. If we rounded up, we would have gone to 300. If we rounded down, we would go to 200. We're clearly closer to 200. And we can verify that with the rule. The tens place, we're in the 40's here. The tens place is a 4. We're going to round down. Now let's think about 354. If we were to plot that, this is 350. 354 might be right over here. So if we rounded down, we would go to 300. If we rounded up, we would go to 400. Now let's apply our rule, and let's also think about it on the number line. This is all about finding the multiple of 100 that it's closest to. If you're trying to round to the nearest 100, you want to look at the tens place, a place to the right of the place you're rounding to. If the tens place is a 5 or larger, you're going to round up. This is a 5 or larger so we're going to round up to 400. And that also makes sense. The rule is really valuable. If you're right at 350, right in between, then you would need the rule to say, hey, let's look at this 5 and round up. But 354 is also closer to 400 than it is to 300. It's 54 away from 300. It's 46 away from 400. So it makes sense that we would round up to 400.",math_arithmetic-home_arith-place-value
" -  What we're gonna do in this video is introduce ourselves to the notion of a definite integral and with indefinite integrals and derivatives this is really one of the pillars of calculus and as we'll see, they're all related and we'll see that more and more in future videos and we'll also get a better appreciation for even where the notation of a definite integral comes from. So, let me draw some functions here and we're actually gonna start thinking about areas under curves. So, let me draw a coordinate axes here, so that's my Y axis, this is my X axis, actually I'm gonna do two cases. So, this is my Y axis, this is my X axis and let's say I have some function here, so this F of X right over there and let's say that this is X equals A and let me draw a line going straight up like that and let's say that this is X equals B, just like that and what we want to do is concern ourselves with the area under the graph, under the graph of Y is equal to F of X and above the X axis and between these two bounds, between X equals A and X equals B, so this area right over here and you can already get an appreciation. We're not used to finding areas where one of the boundaries or as we'll see in the future, many of the boundaries could actually be curves but that's one of the powers of the definite integral and one of the powers of integral calculus. And so, the notation for this area right over here would be the definite integral and so, we're gonna have our lower bound at X equals A, so we'll write it there, we'll have our upper bound at X equals B, right over there. We're taking the area under the curve of F of X, F of X and then DX. Now, in the future we're going to, especially once we start looking at Riemann sums, we'll get a better understanding of where this notation comes from. This actually comes from Leibniz, one of the founders of calculus. This is known as the summa symbol but for the sake of this video you just need to know what this represents. This right over here, this represents the area under F of X between X equals A and X equals B. So, this value and this expression should be the same",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-accumulation-riemann-sums
" In the last video, we were able to model the average high temperature in Santiago, Chile as a function of days as we go through the year, where the days were the days after January 7th, so this right over here. Day zero is actually January 7th. But we weren't done. They want us to figure out how many days after January 7th is the first spring day, when the temperature reaches 20 degrees celsius And I told you, be careful. Pay attention to this whole notion of the first spring day and the reason is because there's actually two days where the temperature reaches 20 degrees celsius, So let's say this is 20 degrees celsius right over here, notice you have this day right over here and then you have this day right over there and which one is in the spring or the first spring day? Well, if this is - we're in summer right over here We're in the southern hemisphere, so our summer is going to be when it is the winter in the northern hemisphere. Summer, what season comes after summer? Well, this is going to be the fall, this is going to be the winter, Now this is going to be the spring. Of course, you go back to summer. So, we want this value, not this value. This one will be the day in fall when the average high temperature is 20 degrees celsius, This is the first day of spring where the average high temperature is 20 degrees celsius. The first spring day. I guess it's not necessarily the first spring day, it's the first spring day where the temperature reaches 20 degrees celsius. So, this is happening in the spring, so this is the value we want. So, let's just think about that. As we try to manipulate this a little bit. So, we want to get to 20 degrees celsius, so we could write 20 is equal to 7.5 times cosine of 2 pi over 365 times the days, plus 21.5 Now, we could subtract 21.5 from both sides and we get -1.5 is equal to- and I'll just copy and paste all of this- is going to be equal to that. So, copy and paste. It's going to be equal to that right over there. Now I could divide both sides by 7.5. Notice, I'm trying to solve for cosine, and eventually solve for D, but we're going to take a pause, once we have this in terms of cosine, we have to be careful here. So we're going to divide both sides by 7.5 And we're going to get, let's see... Actually, I don't even need a calculator for this.. 1.5 divided by 7 - this is one fifth. 5 times 15, or 5 times 1.5 is 7.5 so this is -1/5 or I could write it as -0.2 is equal to cosine of 2 pi over 365 times days after January 7th. Now, this is where we have to be very careful instead of just blindly applying the inverse cosine function, we have to make sure which angle we are actually getting. That we're getting the right angle over here. 'Cause remember, we want the argument to the cosine, that doesn't give us this point, that gives us this point right here. Or that corresponds to this point right over there. So let's draw a unit circle, just to make sure we know what's going on. And I actually do this all the time, especially if I'm trying to apply the inverse trigonometric functions in a kind of applied context, where I just can't blindly plug it in to my calculator. So, let me draw a unit circle right over here. X-axis, y-axis... Circle of radius 1, centered at the origin You get the picture we've done this many times before. And January 7th, that corresponds to this point right over here. That's that point right over here, that we are in the summer. Then, as the days go by, our argument to the cosine increases, the angle increases, and this right over here will be the fall. So, this point right over here, so we're at the fall right over here. And then we move on to the winter right over there. And then finally, we go to the spring. This is the spring right over there. And we want the angle that gets us -0.2 So, this is -1. -0.2 is a fifth of the way, so it's -0.2 and notice, there's two angles that get us there. There's this angle, there's that angle right over there. And then there's also, let me draw a little dotted line here, there's that angle. But then there's also this angle. which is going even further. Or another way you could think about it, you could go backwards to get to that angle and then if you wanted to go all the way around, to the next spring, you could add 2 pi to it. So which one do we want? Of course, we want the one in the spring. But if we just blindly apply the inverse cosine, of -0.2, that's going to give us this one. And we can verify that. So, let's see... Inverse cosine of -0.2 is 1.77. Remember, this is zero, this is pi right over, so this is 3.14159, and this is 1.77, so notice it's a little bit more than half of pi which is exactly what it gave- it gave this angle right over here. So this is approximately 1.77 radiants is this angle, is that angle right over there. But we don't want that one, we want this one, so how do we figure that out? Well, we could view it as, we could go all the way around to 2 pi, and then subtract 1.77, so we could say 2 pi minus 1.77 roughly to get this angle, so let's do that. Let's take 2 times pi, and then subtract this number and I'm going to do second answer, so answer is just the previous answer that I got so that way I have good precision here. So I get 4.511, and we can kind of make sure that is the right thing because that's going to be between pi and 2 pi. 2 pi is 2 times 3.14159, so it's going to be 6.28 something. This is 3.14159, this is the right angle. Now, we're not done yet. That's just the angle, that's the argument that we need to give in here to get to that point, but what's the days going to be. Well 2 pi over 365 days is going to be equal to this number 4.511, so let me write that down. So, this right over here is going to be approximately equal to 4.511. So, we scroll down a little bit We can say 2 pi over 365 times the days after January 7th is approximately going to be equal to 4.511 to solve for days, we can just multiply both sides by the reciprocal of the coefficient, so we're going to multiply both sides by 365 over 2 pi. So that's going to cancel, and now we can use our calculator for this. So, we've got much better precision there. So let's take our previous answer, times 365, we deserve a drumroll here... Divided by 2 pi, and we get if we round to the nearest day 262 days after January 7th. So 262 days. and we are done.",math_engageny-precalc_precalc-4
" We're asked to graph y is equal to 5 to the x-th power. And we'll just do this the most basic way. We'll just try out some values for x and see what we get for y. And then we'll plot those coordinates. So let's try some negative and some positive values. And I'll try to center them around 0. So this will be my x values. This will be my y values. Let's start first with something reasonably negative but not too negative. So let's say we start with x is equal to negative 2. Then y is equal to 5 to the x power, or 5 to the negative 2 power, which we know is the same thing as 1 over 5 to the positive 2 power, which is just 1/25. Now let's try another value. What happens when x is equal to negative 1? Then y is 5 to the negative 1 power, which is the same thing as 1 over 5 to the first power, or just 1/5. Now let's think about when x is equal to 0. Then y is going to be equal to 5 to the 0-th power, which we know anything to the 0-th power is going to be equal to 1. So this is going to be equal to 1. And then finally, we have-- well, actually, let's try a couple of more points here. Let me extend this table a little bit further. Let's try out x is equal to 1. Then y is 5 to the first power, which is just equal to 5. And let's do one last value over here. Let's see what happens when x is equal to 2. Then y is 5 squared, 5 to the second power, which is just equal to 25. And now we can plot it to see how this actually looks. So let me get some graph paper going here. My x's go as low as negative 2, as high as positive 2. And then my y's go all the way from 1/25 all the way to 25. So I have positive values over here. So let me draw it like this. So this could be my x-axis. That could be my x-axis. And then let's make this my y-axis. I'll draw it as neatly as I can. So let's make that my y-axis. And my x values, this could be negative 2. Actually, make my y-axis keep going. So that's y. This is x. That's a negative 2. That's negative 1. That's 0. That is 1. And that is positive 2. And let's plot the points. x is negative 2. y is 1/25. Actually, let me make the scale on the y-axis. So let's make this. So we're going to go all the way to 25. So let's say that this is 5. Actually, I have to do it a little bit smaller than that, too. So this is going to be 5, 10, 15, 20. And then 25 would be right where I wrote the y, give or take. So now let's plot them. Negative 2, 1/25. 1 is going to be like there. So 1/25 is going to be really, really close to the x-axis. That's about 1/25. So that is negative 2, 1/25. It's not going to be on the x-axis. 1/25 is obviously greater than 0. It's going to be really, really, really, really, close. Now let's do this point here in orange, negative 1, 1/5. Negative 1/5-- 1/5 on this scale is still pretty close. It's pretty close. So that right over there is negative 1, 1/5. And now in blue, we have 0 comma 1. 0 comma 1 is going to be right about there. If this is 2 and 1/2, that looks about right for 1. And then we have 1 comma 5. 1 comma 5 puts us right over there. And then finally, we have 2 comma 25. When x is 2, y is 25. 2 comma 25 puts us right about there. And so I think you see what happens with this function, with this graph. The further in the negative direction we go, 5 to ever-increasing negative powers gets closer and closer to 0, but never quite. So we're leaving 0, getting slightly further, further, further from 0. Right at the y-axis, we have y equal 1. Right at x is equal to 0, we have y is equal to 1. And then once x starts increasing beyond 0, then we start seeing what the exponential is good at, which is just this very rapid increase. Some people would call it an exponential increase, which is obviously the case right over here. So then if I just keep this curve going, you see it's just going on this sometimes called a hockey stick. It just keeps on going up like this at a super fast rate, ever-increasing rate. So you could keep going forever to the left, and you'd get closer and closer and closer to 0 without quite getting to 0. So 5 to the negative billionth power is still not going to get you to 0, but it's going to get you pretty darn close to 0. But obviously, if you go to 5 to the positive billionth power, you're going to get to a super huge number because this thing is just going to keep skyrocketing up like that. So let me just draw the whole curve, just to make sure you see it. Over here, I'm not actually on 0, although the way I drew it, it might look like that. I'm slightly above 0. I'm increasing above that, increasing above that. And once I get into the positive x's, then I start really, really shooting up.",math_math1_exp-func
" I just received this drug calculation problem from a nursing student, and I think it's essential that the nursing students out there are able to do this, just in case I'm the patient receiving the drug. So let's do it. And I think it's an interesting unit conversion problem for pretty much anyone who wants practice with unit conversion. So the question is that we have a doctor. The doctor orders drug x. And this is the dosage that the doctor's requesting. They're saying 5 milligrams per pound of patient weight-- I'll just write per pound of patient weight-- every 12 hours. This is what we're supposed to do. But our supply of the drug-- it isn't just, you know, not just nuggets and milligrams. It's a solution. There's a certain amount of grams for every milliliter that we have of the solution. It's dissolved in some water. So this is our supply of drug x. We have 0.9-- I'll write a 0 in front. My wife, who is a doctor, says it's essential to write the 0 in front of the decimal. We have 0.9 grams per milliliter of solution. So if I were to take 1 milliliter out of my solution and give it to someone, I'm essentially giving them 0.9 grams of this drug. And the final piece of information we're given is that the patient-- they weigh-- and maybe we should say they mass, because kilograms is mass, but we get the idea. The patient is 72.7 kilograms. So there's a couple interesting things here. We have to figure out the dosage in terms of milliliters. We have to-- oh, actually, I didn't even tell you the question. The question is, how many milliliters of solution do we have to give to the patient per dose? So milliliters of solution per dose. That's our question. And there's a couple of things. We have to go from milligrams to grams. And then convert that to milliliters. And then they tell us per pound, but then they gave us the patient's weight, or their mass, in kilograms. So we have to do some conversion there. So I definitely can appreciate how this can be a little daunting and maybe confusing at times. So let's just do it step by step. So the first interesting thing-- and this is just something that you might need to know, or you might have written down on paper, or you might have a calculator that does this-- is just how to convert kilograms to pounds. And it's good to know in general, if you're converting between the metric and the English systems. So 1 kilogram is approximately equal to 2.2 pounds. Not exactly, but that's a pretty good approximation. And 1 pound-- if you just take 1 over that-- 1 pound is approximately equal to 0.45 kilograms. So we'll just put this in a box. This is the only kind of outside conversion information we'll need to do this problem. Everything else, we'll just need a calculator, unless we just want to spend a lot of time doing some arithmetic. So the first thing. Let's figure out our dosage in terms of per kilogram. This is per pound, and we really don't need to know every 12 hours. Because they're saying, how many milliliters of solution do we do per dose? A dose is every 12 hours. So we just really, you know-- the every 12 hours is kind of extra information. So we want to figure out this 5 milligrams per pound. How do we convert that to how many milligrams per kilogram? So let's do 5-- I'll write it down here in magenta-- 5 milligrams per pound. And then we want to convert this to per kilogram. So we can multiply this times the number of pounds per kilogram-- I'll do it in yellow-- times this information up here. Times 2.2 pounds per kilogram. And if you ever get confused-- you know, gee, how did Sal know to multiply by 2.2 instead of dividing by 2.2? Which is the same thing as multiplying by 0.5. You can pay very close attention to the units. Notice, I wrote 2.2 pounds per kilogram. 2.2 pounds per 1 kilogram. And you know this'll work out, because you have a pound in the numerator and you have a pound in the denominator. It's called dimensional analysis. If you ever get confused with these things-- and I think, once you do enough practice, you'll find that you won't have to pay too much attention to this. But at first, when you're getting started, just to make sure you're not multiplying or dividing by the wrong thing, just make sure the dimensions cancel out. Pounds in the numerator, pounds in the denominator. So let's do that. Pounds in the numerator, pounds in the denominator cancel out. And you multiply 5 times 2.2. This is equal to-- let's see. 5 times 2 is 10. 5 times 0.2 is 1. So this is equal to 11. And then in our numerator, we have milligrams. 11 milligrams per kilogram. So we just converted our dosage information to a pure metric system. It was actually a mix between the metric and the English system before. Now let's see what we can do. Well, let's see if we can get it in terms of how many milliliters we have to deliver per pound. So once again, we want this-- well, actually, let's go to grams first. Because we have milligrams here. We have grams up here. So let's see if we can convert this thing to grams. So just like we did before, we want a milligrams in the denominator. I'll do it in orange. We want a milligrams in the denominator and we want a gram in the numerator. Why did I say that? Because I want this and this to cancel. And I want a grams in the numerator. So how many grams are there per milligram? You can just think it through. There's 1 gram per 1,000 milligrams. Or 1,000 milligrams per gram. And you just multiply it out. So the milligrams cancels with the milligrams, and then we get-- this is equal to 11/1,000 grams per kilogram. So now we have everything in terms of grams, but we want it in terms of milliliters. The question is, how many milliliters of solution per dose? So let me go down here on this line right here. So we had this result. We have 11/1,000-- I won't do the division just yet-- grams of drug x per kilogram. This is really just a re-- we've just rewritten this dosage information in different units. And let's see how much solution we need per kilogram. So I want to cancel out the grams here and have a milliliters there. So to cancel out that grams, I'm going to have to have a gram in the denominator and a milliliter in the numerator. So in our solution, how many grams are there per milliliter? Well, they told us. There are 0.9 grams per milliliter. Or for every 1 milliliter, there are 0.9 grams. Notice, I just took the inverse of that. Because we want a milliliter in the numerator, grams in the denominator, so that these two cancel out. And let's do this multiplication now. So our grams cancel out. We have milliliters per kilogram. And then we multiply it out. 11/1,000 times 1 over 0.9. So I'll just keep-- let me just write it like this. So there's going to be 11/1,000 times 0.9 milliliters of our solution per kilogram. So we've gotten this far. So this is per kilogram of patient body weight. And then finally, they tell us how many kilograms our patient weighs. So let's do that last multiplication, and then we can actually get our calculator out and do it all at once. So let's multiply this times-- we want to know how many milliliters per patient. We want the kilograms to cancel out. So we want kilograms per patient. Now we're talking about this particular patient. Not every patient is going to be the same number of kilograms. But if we do this, kilograms will cancel out. We'll have milliliters per patient-- milliliters of solution per patient-- which is exactly what we want. We want milliliters of solution per dose per patient. But everything we've assumed so far has been per dose. So how many kilograms does the patient weigh? Well, there's 72.7 kilograms per patient. That's how much the patient weighs. So we just do this final multiplication and we'll be done. So our answer-- and as these two things are going to cancel out-- so our final answer is going to be 11 times 72.7 divided by 100 times-- actually, 100 times 0.9 is pretty easy to figure out. That's 900. Divided by 900 milliliters per patient. Or you can just say milliliters per dose. However you want to say it. Per dose per patient. Let's get our calculator out and do this. So we have 11 times 72.7 is equal to 799 divided by 900. Is equal to 0.88-- well, we could round up. 0.889. Hopefully the doctor won't mind. 1So that is equal to-- I'll write it in a nice, vibrant 1color-- 0.889 milliliters of solution per dose. 1So this is what we're going to give every 12 hours. 1If they ask, how many total milliliters over the 1course of 2 days? 1We would have to say, oh, there's 48 hours. 1We'd multiply it by 4. 1But that 12 hours was extra information in this problem. 1But anyway, hopefully this is useful, and it'll ensure that 1any nurses serving me in the future are giving me 1my proper dosage. 1And hopefully, the doctor even got the right dosage to begin 1with, because otherwise it's all for naught. 1Anyway.",math_algebra_working-units
" So let's calculate what 2/5 divided by 7/3 is, and I encourage you to pause this video and try to calculate this on your own. Well we just have to remind ourselves that this is going to be the exact same thing as 2 over 5 times the reciprocal of 7/3, which is 3 over 7. And then multiplying two fractions is pretty straightforward. This is just going to be equal to the product of the numerators. So 2 times 3 over the product of the denominators, over 5 times 7-- I'm trying to keep the colors consistent-- which of course is going to be equal to 2 times 3 is equal to 6. And 5 times 7-- I'll do this in a new color, let's see, I haven't used this shade of blue yet-- 5 times 7 of course is equal to 35. So this is equal to 6/35.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-fractions-icse
" -  Let's say that we have the linear equation, y = 1/2x - 3. So if we wanted to draw the line that represents the set of all points, all the coordinates where the x value and the y value satisfy this equation, we could start off by just trying to draw, by trying to draw a few of those points, and then connecting them with a line. Let's set up a little table here x, y. And we can just try a couple of x values here, then figure out what the corresponding y values are. I'm going to pick x values where it's going to be fairly easy to calculate the y values. Let's say when x is equal to zero, then you're gonna have 1/2 x 0 - 3, well then y is going to be -3. When x is, let me try x = 2, because then 1/2 x 2 is just gonna be 1. So when x = 2, you're going to have 1/2 x 2 = 1, -3 is -2. When x is equal to, let's try 4. So 1/2 x 4 is 2, and then -3 is -1, and we could keep going but actually all we need is two points for a line. So we're ready to plot this line if we'd like. The point 0, -3 is on this line. 0, -3 and actually let me do this in a slightly darker color so that we can see it on this white background. 0, -3 is on the line, 2, -2 is on the line. So 2, -2 and then we have 4, -1. So when x is 4, y is -1, and I could draw a line that connects all of these so it would look something like... If I, let's see if I could do this. It would look something like, it would something like, like that. So this right over here, this is literally, this is the graph of y = 1/2x - 3. Now when we look at a graph like this an interesting thing that we might want to ask ourself is where does the graph intersect our axes? So first we can say, well where does in intersect our x-axis? When you look at this, it looks like it happens at this point right over here. This point where a graph intersects an axes this is called an intercept. This one in particular is called the x-intercept. Why is it called the x-intercept? Because that's where the graph is intersecting the x-axis and the x-intercept, it looks like this is at the .6, 0. Now it's very interesting, the x-intercept happens when y = 0. Remember, you're on the x-axis when you haven't moved up or down from that axis which means y = 0. So your x-intercept happens at x = 6, y = 0. It's this coordinate. Now what about the y-intercept? Well the y-intercept is this point right over here. This is where you intersect or I guess you could say intercept the y-axis. So this right over here, that over there is the y-intercept. The y-intercept is at the coordinate that has a 0 for the x-coordinate. X is 0 here and y is -3. X is 0 and y is -3. This was actually one of the points, or one of the pairs that we first tried out. You can validate that 6, 0 satisfies this equation right over here. If x is 6, 1/2 x 6 is 3, -3 is indeed equal to 0. So now that we know what an x-intercept is, it's the point where a graph intersects the x-axis or intercepts the x-axis and the y-intercept is the point where a graph intercepts the y-axis or intersects the y-axis. Let's try to see if we can find the x and y-intercepts for a few other linear equations. So let's say that I had the linear equation. Let's say that I have 5x + 6y = 30. I encourage you to pause this video, and figure out what are the x and y-intercepts for the graph that represents the solutions, all the xy pairs that satisfy this equation. Well the easiest thing to do here, let's see what the y value is when x = 0 and what x value is when y = 0. When x = 0 this becomes 6y = 30. So 6 times what is 30? Well y would be equal to 5 here. So when x is 0, y is 5. What about when y is 0? Well when y is 0, that's going to be 0, and you have 5x = 30. Well then x would be equal to 6. Then x would be equal to 6. So we could plot those points, 0, 5. When x is 0, y is 5. When x is 6, y is 0. So those are both points on this graph and then the actual graph is going to, or the actual line that represents the x and y pairs that satisfy this equation is going to look like, it's going to look like this. I'll just try. So I can make it go, it's going to look like... It's going to go through those two points. So it going to...I can make it go the other way too. Let me see. It's going to go through those two points and so it's going to look something like that. Now what are its' x and y-intercepts? Well, we already kind of figured it out but the intercepts themselves, these are the points on the graph where they intersect the axes. So this right over here, this is the y-intercept. That point is the y-intercept and it happens, it's always going to happen when x = 0, and when x = 0 we know that y = 5. It's that point, the point 0, 5. And what is the y inter...what is the x-intercept? The x-intercept is the point, it's actually the same x-intercept for this equation right over here. It's the point 6, 0. That point right over there.",math_math1_two-var-eq
" We've worked really, really hard to understand PV loops. Now I want to show you how PV loops-- and more specifically, PV boxes-- can be helpful in understanding what's going on in our heart. These are going to be three diagrams. We're going to write out three diagrams. And in all three, we're going to see how PV boxes change shape if we tweak one of three things. So the first thing we can tweak is contractility. The second thing is arterial elastance-- or sometimes we just call that ""Ea."" And the third thing we can tweak to change our PV box is preload. So these are going to be the three ways that we can actually change how the box looks. And I want to actually walk you through exactly will happen if we change it. So let's do contractility first. Let's see how contractility can change our PV box. And to start out, I actually kind of want to show you how I think about these things. I'm drawing a little cement block here. And this cement block is to remind me that the ESPVR line-- remember, this end-systolic pressure-volume relationship-- is going to be fixed in terms of the volume at which it hits the bottom. And the reason for that is that you know that there's a certain minimum volume that you need to be able to get pressure in your left ventricle. And that isn't going to change. So I think of that line as being fixed. And then, there's a second line. Let's say I draw it out right here. And this is my arterial elastance line. And at the bottom of that line-- instead of just letting it hit the baseline-- I'm actually going to show you how I think about it. I think about it as kind of having a wheel. A little wheel. And the reason for that drawing a wheel is to show you that, if I wanted to move it, I could. In this particular case, we're going to leave the wheel alone. We're not going to move it. And we're only going to change contractility. Just try to think about what change in contractility means exactly. Well, what that's going to do is that's going to pivot-- I'm going to write it down here-- pivot the ESPVR line. It's going to cause changes to the ESPVR line. Let's now draw that out. Let's say we actually increase-- so I'll do increase first. Well, actually, maybe, even before doing that, let's actually draw what the pressure volume loop looks like to start out with. I just have to take the two corners. These will be the two corners. And I draw a box that connects the two corners. Right? These are the two corners of my box. It actually looks more like a rectangle than a box, but that's OK. We call them ""boxes"" even though they're sometimes rectangles. And the height of the rectangle is the end-systolic pressure. The width of my box is stroke volume. So stroke volume is kind of how wide it is, and end-systolic pressure is how tall it is. So what's going to happen if I actually now increase-- let's start with increase-- my contractility? Well, increasing contractility means that I pivot that way. And I'm going to write a little plus sign to mean increase. And I have to start at that cinder block because I said it's always fixed. It's not going to move. And I just kind of draw it. Like that. So this is my new line. And to draw the box, I just have to say, well, where does it cross the Ea line-- the arterial elastance line? It crosses at the blue dot. The other corner is going to have the same point as my wheel. Right? I just have to draw a vertical line down and a horizontal line across, and I've got my box. There's my box. And it's a little bit bigger than my green box. And it's increased both the width and how tall it is. Right? So now it's taller and wider. And that means that my stroke volume went up because that's my wideness. That went up. And also, my end-systolic pressure went up. Right? So this length is higher. Both the end-systolic pressure and the stroke volume went up just by increasing the contractility. That's good and easy to remember. Just imagine that line pivoting. And if I wanted to know what happens if I decrease contractility, I could just draw a third line. This would be a decrease in contractility because it's pivoting down. And now, I draw a new dot where the red line and the purple line cross. And I draw a box from there-- just as before-- to my wheel, which is right there. And I say, well, wow. Now my box is smaller. So the amount of stroke work or the area in my box went down, and both dimensions of my box went down. Again, the end-systolic pressure-- I'm not going to write it out, but-- well, I guess I could write it out over here. This is now smaller than the green value. And my stroke volume is actually smaller. This is smaller than it was as well. So both the stroke volume and the end-systolic pressure went down. These are the changes you see with changes in contractility. And remember, it all goes back to pivoting the ESPVR line. By increasing or decreasing contractility, what you're doing is increasing or decreasing the size of the box. Let's move on to arterial elastance. I think the first example is pretty easy. I think you've got it. Let's move on to the second example, and I'm going to draw it kind of the same way with a little cinder block here and a line coming off of it. Let's say the line is something like that. I'm trying to draw it very similar to the first time but probably not identical, I guess. I'll draw a purple Ea line coming like this with the little wheel at the bottom. And again, I'm not going to move the wheel, but I want you to always remember that it could be moved if I wanted to. But in this case, we're not going to move it. What we're going to do instead is we're going to change arterial elastance. And what that does is it pivots-- so just as the other one pivoted, this one also pivots-- this one pivots-- I should probably write an ""s,"" ""pivots""-- the arterial elastance line. So now, instead of pivoting the yellow line, we're going to pivot the purple line. Let me start by drawing my first box, kind of our standard box, just as a point of reference. Right? You need that just to see how things change. You've got to know how things started. So this is my initial PV box. And if I was to pivot things-- let's say I now moved the arterial elastance up. The two ways I could do this, remember, are to increase the heart rate or increase the resistance. Now, if I moved it up like that, then my new line would look something like this. Let's say that would be my new line. Remember, there's still a wheel down here. So that's my new line. And what would my new box look like? The blue line and the yellow line cross right there. So I just have to draw my box using that as my example, and I could do this. This is my new box. And now, if I was to shade the new area, this is kind of the increase area. But there's also kind of a decrease. Right? I also lost a little bit of stroke volume on this side. So I just want to point that out to you. So you do lose some stroke volume, but you gain some end-systolic pressure. So if I was to write the new variables in, you can see the stroke volume's a little tinier than it used to be, but the end-systolic pressure has gone up. So this is different than the first example. In the first example, the entire box basically just got bigger or smaller as contractility went up or down. But now, you're seeing that one dimension goes up-- in this case, the pressure went up-- but the other dimension goes down. That was the stroke volume. And if I was to actually shift it the other way-- let's say I kind of shifted things this way-- now my line pivots that way, and the arterial elastance is lower. Now my new box is actually going to do the opposite. The stroke volume actually increases. And I could finish off this box like that and like that. Now my stroke volume increases because look at this big stroke volume over here. Right? This is a bigger stroke volume than it ever used to be, but the end-systolic pressure went down. This is actually lower than the original green box or the blue box. Here, it's actually a little different. When you pivot the arterial elastance line-- which is what we're doing-- you can actually see that now you're kind of trading off. On the one hand, you can increase pressure if you are willing to get a smaller stroke volume. Or you can do the opposite. You can actually decrease pressure and get a larger stroke volume. So this is actually kind of different than what was happening in the first example. Now, let's move to our third example and see how the pressure volume box will change with preload. So here I'm going to start out the same way as before, kind of drawing my cinder block just to kind of remind myself that this ESPVR line never really shifts. It always stays at one point, even though we know it can pivot. It doesn't roll. I'm going to finally give you an example of what rolling would do. So let's say you have our Ea line with a little wheel here. What preload does is it rolls. Actually, let me change the color there because that's kind of a weird color. Let's do that. It rolls the Ea line. So that's different than what was happening with the pivoting of the Ea line. So when I roll it, what I mean-- I'll show you in just a second-- it's actually going to move the entire line. So this is my initial PV box. Right? Something like this. And if I now decide I want to increase-- 1let's start with increase my preload-- 1then I would basically kind of move things this way. 1You want to draw a plus sign here. 1Now, my new line. 1Let's say it's over here. 1And I'm going to have to draw this as best I can to make sure 1that I maintain the exact same slope because the slope does 1not change. 1And that's my new line. 1And actually, I should probably-- well, yeah. 1Maybe I should do that in a different color just 1to make it very, very clear because I 1don't like having two purple lines. 1It looks too similar. 1So this would be my new blue line. 1And I can also do the opposite and move it in. 1And actually, that would be a decrease in preload, 1and that would actually look like this. 1So you can see that, basically, what 1happens is that the line shifts. 1The entire line shifts, but the slope stays the same. 1So that's what I mean when I say ""rolling"" the line. 1Actually, let's draw out our box to see what that looks like. 1So if I increase preload, then my new box 1basically gets much bigger. 1So my new box is a larger area than my green box. 1Right? 1You can see it's much, much larger. 1Even though there's a little sliver 1of green on the left side, I'm going 1to show you that we have to at least identify. 1You have this bit right here that you lost. 1Right? 1This little bit. 1But overall, you gained much more than you lost. 1So the blue box is definitely bigger. 1And in fact, it's not only bigger 1in stroke volume-- this is definitely larger-- 1but it's also a bigger in end-systolic pressure. 1They both went up. 1A larger preload-- it's not like it would happen forever, 1but within certain limits-- it basically increases your stroke 1volume and increases your pressure. 1And the opposite is true, too. 1So if you decrease your preload, you get a tinier box. 1So basically, this is my small box here. 1And this box I'm going to kind of draw in for you. 1Maybe I'll just color the whole thing in just 1so you can kind of see the area of the small box. 1This red box is obviously much smaller 1than the green box used to be. 1So stroke volume has gone down here. 1It's gotten smaller. 1And end-systolic pressure has also gone down. 1What happens with preload is actually, in some ways, 1kind of similar to what happened with contractility. 1Basically, as you go down in preload, 1the entire box gets smaller, and both dimensions of the box 1get smaller. 1And as preload goes up, the opposite 1happens-- both dimensions, stroke volume 1and end-systolic pressure, go up. 1And the entire box, therefore, goes up. 1And this is quite different than what 1happened in the middle example with arterial elastance, 1where it was more of a trade-off between the two. 1Right? 1In one case, you had a higher stroke volume. 1In the other case, you had a higher end-systolic pressure. 1So this is how you can kind of put it together. 1Just kind of think about two lines. 1It's actually quite simple. 1One of them is fixed. 1The other rolls. 1And then, you can very easily draw out your box. 1And then you can just see what the differences would be.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system
" So I have a picture for you of Adolf Fick. And this is probably the second most well-known Adolf in history, but this Adolf was well known for his science. He actually came up with some fantastic laws that we use in all sorts of different branches in science today. And we're going to talk about one of his laws right now. So I drew for you a little box, and I thought one of the most fun ways to think about some of these laws that Mr. Fick came up with was to do a little game. So I'm going to give you a challenge. And the challenge is that, let's say that you're a person standing right here, maybe standing behind this box. And the part of the box that's facing you, that's nearest you, is that blue wall that I kind of shaded in. This blue wall is the back wall of the box. And on the front wall, I'm actually going to put in some little molecules. Let's say there are some molecules I'll put in, I don't know, let's say three or four molecules here. And the challenge is this, if a molecule gets from the front of the box-- I'm going to call it one, this first side is side one-- if it gets from side one, which is here, over to side two, which is the back wall, if it gets from side one to side two of the box, then you get $5 for each particle that makes it over. So to put that into words, we're interested in the amount of particles that move over some period of time. And that period of time can be one hour or 10 hours, whatever period of time we want. But I'm going to-- just for argument's sake, let's just say that we're going to do this for one hour. So let's say I do it for an hour and these molecules started moving around, they're migrating around, because, of course, they're bouncing, these molecules don't stay stationary. And I come back, and it turns out that only one molecule ever eventually made it over to this side. So I say, hey, good job, you get $5 because I promised that to you. And so of course you get your $5, and you're happy and smiling, right? But I'm feeling in a generous mood, and I say, you know what, let's start this experiment over. Let's just start over, and this time I'm actually going to give you a chance to tweak the experiment. You're going to actually get a chance to modify the experiment. And you can do whatever you want to try to maximize your profits. So think about this, you want to try to maximize this right here. And how do you do that? How do you maximize the amount of particles that make it to that blue wall over some period of time? And I'm going to write your good ideas down here, so start brainstorming some good ideas for how you might want to tweak the game, or play the game, to maximize your profits. Well, if you're thinking about this, you might think, well, maybe the first obvious thing is why do you make this so darn far? Why not make it a little bit closer? So let's get rid of this back wall and scooch it nearer, so that the molecules don't have to go so far. And that's a pretty good idea it seems to me, right? So let's just make this a little bit smaller. That's your first idea, and I would say, that's a brilliant strategy. Now let's just make it half the size, so it's less thick, and these molecules don't have to go nearly as far. And actually, let me maintain the blue wall so we can keep seeing properly what this should look like. And this is going to be dashed back here, and like that, and of course the blue wall is going to look like that. So now you just basically make it come closer and so the molecules don't have to go nearly as far. So idea one is less thick wall. What's another idea? Well you remember from Graham's law, we learned that these molecules, the big ones, actually don't move. Their diffusion rate is not as quick, and that it's the smaller molecules that actually have a faster diffusion rate. So if I'm waiting at that back wall to see how many molecules can get over, I want tiny little molecules to make their way over because they're going to have a faster diffusion rate. When I say tiny, I really mean smaller molecular weight. So small molecular weight molecules, that's the second idea. Change up the molecules, make the molecular weight smaller, and as Graham's law tells us, they'll move faster. So what's a third idea? Well, maybe you could just have more of them. Maybe in this number one plane, which is the leftmost plane of this box, why don't you just jam it full of more little molecules? If you have more molecules moving around-- that's another way of saying just increasing the pressure, that's increasing the pressure at that position one-- then you're going to have a better chance of having molecules move across. So increased pressure at one. And what's a fourth idea? I'm just going to make a little bit of space. What's a fourth idea that we can maybe put on here? Well, if you're thinking really outside the box, and this is actually literally outside the box, then you might think, well, why not just expand this entire thing? Make it a larger area. What about that? Why not just make a larger area. So that's the last idea. Maybe you can actually just make it a bigger surface area. So maybe something like this, you could expand it in all directions. And maybe you can do something like that. I'm going to have to make sure I draw it carefully so don't confuse you, but basically something like this, where you now have the same thickness, I'm not changing the thickness, but I'm basically-- you're going to make this wall bigger. Actually, I screwed that up a little bit. Let me just fix that. So this is what my new back wall is going to look like and maybe I should do it in blue just to make sure we stay consistent with the colors. But of course, this is just going to extend out like that. And this is my new back wall. Right, this whole thing is my back wall. And so if I expand the area, now I have, of course, much more chance of getting some of these molecules back there. And the partial pressure is going to stay the same, so if I expand the area, I still have more molecules on this initial leftmost face. And so the pressure is going to stay the same. This is the P1 that we just got through talking about. But because I have more area there's more chance that somewhere along this entire area a molecule will make its way across the thickness and hit that back wall. So something like that. And let me fill this in. So this is a fourth idea. Let me write that down as the fourth idea, is increase the area. So these are four good ideas, four good ideas for how you can maximize the amount of particles over time and hopefully make as much money as you can. Probably much more than $5. So this is exactly what Fick's law talks about. It talks about the idea of amounts of particles moving over time. So let me write out Fick's law, and this is actually how you most commonly will come across it, although there are some variations on it. It's going to look something like this. And I'm actually going to try to color code it to go along with the ideas that we already presented. So we said there's some things you can do with pressure, some things you might do with the surface area, and also, remember we had that diffusion constant. And you divide all this stuff by the thickness of the wall. So it's very colorful, but this is Fick's law as you usually see it. There are some other variations I'll talk about. So to go through this piece by piece, this is V with a dot over it. This is the rate of particles moving. And when I say rate, you know that that means that there's some time component. So this gets to what the challenge was. We said, how many particles can you get to go to that blue back wall over some period of time. And sometimes when we talk about particles we can think of them as giving that in terms of an amount. You might think of that as like a moles or some numerical value, or the volume of a gas that's moving across. So that's why sometimes you'll see it as V, to refer to volume. On the other side, this bit makes perfect sense. If you have more molecules, that's going to cause more pressure, we said earlier. And if there's a bigger pressure difference between what's on the first side versus what's on the second side-- remember the second side is the back wall-- then of course that's going to mean that more of the molecules are going to move over. So this is a bigger difference. So sometimes you'll see this as delta P, and delta just means difference. This A, we said, refers to just surface area. Of course if you have a greater surface area, that's going to allow for more of the molecules to get across. This D, that's an interesting one. This is diffusion constant. And remember when we think about diffusion constant, there are two laws that might jump into your head. In fact, the first one was Henry's law, and you remember we talked about solubility, in terms of the amount of molecules that go from, for example, air to liquid. This is Henry's law that told us about that. And of course if something is very soluble, then maybe that would be an increased P1, going back to the idea of pressure at the first wall. And then you have to divide by the molecular weight. The square root, in fact, of the molecular weight. So that's the idea we had, and this actually comes from Graham's law. So whenever I talk about the diffusion constant, remember there are two laws that are in play here, Henry's law and Graham's law, that are coming together to offer us some information about the diffusion constant. And that's actually why we said, well, if you have a small molecular weight molecule, maybe that'll help you out, because it's in the denominator it's going to cause the rate of particles moving across to go up. And finally, this T, this is thickness. This is the thickness of the wall. And this is totally intuitive. If you have a thick wall, it's going to be harder for molecules to make it across very quickly. So without even knowing it, you kind of derived Fick's law all by yourself just kind of using intuition, and that's kind of the best way to learn this stuff. And sometimes, as I mentioned, you might see this formula written differently. 1In fact, let me actually just rearrange 1this formula in a different way. 1I'm just going to sketch out how you might also 1see it, which is that sometimes you see area 1on this side of the equation. 1Of course, that's just rearranging it, right, 1dividing both sides by area. 1And then you might see the P actually up here, 1like P1 and then minus P2, something like this. 1And in the denominator over here, you'll see the T. 1So you'll get this, and then very separately you'll 1see times D. 1So this might not look so different, but what happens 1is that then people lump things, and that's 1when things get kind of tricky. 1They'll say well, let's lump this together, 1and let's lump this together. 1And they'll call this flux. 1And this second part they'll call gradient. 1So you may see Fick's law written this way, where 1it says flux equals the gradient times diffusion constant. 1Because of course the diffusion constant hasn't changed, 1it's the same thing, it just carries on down. 1And if you see it that way, let me just 1give you an example of what these things mean. 1Let's start with flux, which is basically 1the net rate of particles moving through an area, 1moving through some area. 1And you can kind of follow through the equation 1and that makes sense. 1And here the important part is the idea of a net rate. 1It's not total rate, but you're actually 1looking for what is the net gain or net rate that you're seeing. 1And this gradient over here, this 1is just change in pressure over-- divided 1by or over-- some distance, or over a distance. 1And occasionally you'll see pressure written out 1as particles in a volume, which is kind of the same thing. 1Conceptually it's the same thing. 1Particles in a volume, of course, 1are going to exert some pressure, 1so sometimes you'll even see it written this way. 1So I guess the point is that you'll 1see these different terms, and I just 1want you to be familiar with them. 1But at least now you know that the most common way you'll 1see Fick's law is written out this way, 1and that it's completely intuitive. 1In fact if you had to come up with it, given some time 1you'd probably come up with Fick's law yourself.",science_health-and-medicine_respiratory-system
" -  ""A lake near the Arctic Circle is covered ""by a 2-meter-thick sheet of ice ""during the cold winter months. ""When spring arrives, the warm air gradually melts the ice, ""causing its thickness to decrease at a constant rate."" It's gonna decrease at a constant rate. ""After 3 weeks, the sheet is only 1.25 meters thick. ""After 3 weeks, the sheet is only 1.25 meters thick. ""Let S(t) denote the ice sheet's thickness S ""(measured in meters) as a function ""of time (measured in weeks). ""Write the function's formula."" Alright, so we have some interesting things here. They've given us some values for this function. We know when time is equal to zero. We know that S of zero, when time equals zero, that's when the sheet is two meters thick. So S of zero is equal to two. And they also tell us that after three weeks, the sheet is only 1.25 meters thick. And when we have the function S of t, S is measured in meters, time is measured in weeks. So after zero weeks, we're two meters thick, and then they tell us, after three weeks-- So S of three. After three weeks, we're 1.25 meters thick. Or another way to think about it, I could write t here in weeks and S in meters, and when time is zero, we're two meters thick, and when time is 1.-- Sorry, when time is three weeks, we are 1.25 meters thick. So when our change in time is equal to positive three, we increased our time by three, what's our change in thickness? Our change in thickness, the triangle here, that's the Greek letter delta, shorthand for ""change in,"" well, this was negative 0.75. So what was the rate of change over this time? And they tell us that the rate of change is at a constant rate. So whatever it is between these two periods of time, between zero weeks and three weeks, it would be that same rate between any two periods of time, between zero week and one week, or one week and two weeks, or 1 1/2 weeks and 1.6 weeks. So what is the rate of change of thickness relative to time? Well, it's going to be change in thickness over change in time. How much does our thickness change per time? Well, we saw right over here. Our thickness went down, set 0.75 meters in three weeks. Or we could say that this right over here is equal to, let's see. 75 divided by three is 25, so 0.75 divided by three is 0.25. We have the negative out there, negative 0.25 meters per week. So how can we take the information we have and express this as a function? It's going to be a linear function, because we see that we are changing at a constant rate. Let's think about it a little bit. Linear functions, one way we could write it is in-- So we could write it-- If we were dealing with x and y, you might recognize y is equal to mx plus b, often written as slope-intercept form. This is when you're dealing with x as the, I guess you could say the independent variable, y as the dependent variable, and b would be where you start. What happens when x equals zero and m is your rate of change, it's your slope? So in this case, we don't have y and x, we're going to have S and t. We have S as a function of time, and it's going to be equal to the rate of change... times time, plus where we started, plus b. Now, what is b going to be? Well, one way to think about it is, well, what's S of zero going to be? S of zero is going to be m times zero, plus b. S of zero is going to be b. Well, we already know that this ice sheet, it starts off at two meters thick. So S of zero is equal to b, is equal to two. So b is equal to two. And what is m? Well, we've already said, that's our rate of change, that is our slope, that is how much our thickness changes with respect to time. And we already figured out that that's negative 0.25. So m is negative 0.25. You could say that m is the slope between this point, between the point zero comma two, and the point three comma 1.25, if we were plotting these points on a t/S coordinate plane. So now we can write what the function's going to be. Maybe I'll do this in a new color just for fun. S of t, thickness as a function of time, is going to be equal to m, negative 0.25, times time, plus two. Or if you want, you could write it like this, two minus 0.25t. I actually like this form a little bit better. In my brain, it kind of describes what's happening a little bit more. When time is equal to zero, you're starting at two meters thick, and then every week that goes by, as t increases by one, you're going to lose a quarter of a meter. You're going to lose, you have a negative value right over here, you're gonna lose 0.25 meters. And if you really want to kind of get this even in a deeper level, I encourage you to graph it, and it'll become even clearer what's going on here. That this right over here is this right over here, is this right over here, this is the slope of the line that represents the solution set to this equation, and this two, this would be your vertical intercept. In this case, it would be your S-intercept as opposed to your y-intercept, when y is the vertical axis.",math_algebra-home_alg-linear-eq-func
" If there are 6 people in your family, and each person drinks 4/5 of a gallon of milk each month, between what two whole numbers is the number of gallons of milk your family will drink each month? So let's think about this a little bit. So I've got my milk gallon here for inspiration. So there's 6 people in my family, or in your family, whoever's family we're talking about. And each of them drink 4/5 of a gallon per month. So we're going to go 6 times 4/5, or 4/5 times 6. Now, what is this going to be equal to? Well, there are several ways we could think about this. One, we can express 6 as a fraction. We could say that this is the same thing as 6/1 times 4/5. And you multiply the numerators. You multiply the denominators. 6 times 4 is 24. And 1 times 5 is 5. So 24/5 gallons are going to be drunk every month. And this is the same thing-- let's see, 5 goes into 20 evenly and has a remainder of 4. So we could write this as 20/5 plus 4/5 5-- let me move over a little bit so I don't run out of space, which is the same thing. This is 4. So this is 4 and 4/5. So that's one way to think about it. The other way, you could think of this as 4/5 times 6, which is the same thing as 4/5 plus 4/5 plus 4/5-- I think you get the idea-- plus 4/5 plus 4/5 plus 4/5. We took literally six 4/5's and added them together. And what's this going to be equal to? Well, this is going to be 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 plus 4 over 5. This is how many 1/5's we have. Well, this is 6 times 4, or you could say 4 times 6, over 5, which is equal to 24 over 5, which we've already figured out is 4 and 4/5. So either way, we're going to drink 4 and 4/5 gallons per month. Now let's try to answer the actual question. Between what two whole numbers? Well, between 4 and 5 gallons a month. 4 and 4/5 is right in between 4 and 5. We got it right.",math_5th-grade-foundations-engageny_5th-m4-engage-ny-foundations
" -  Let's say y is equal to the natural log of x to the xth power, and what we wanna do, we wanna find the derivative of y with respect to x. So I encourage you to pause this video and see if you can do it. So, when you first try to tackle this, this is a little bit daunting. We know how to take the derivative of constants to some x power, but how do we take a derivative of some time of a function, in this case, a natural log, to the xth power? And the answer here is to use some of our logarithmic properties, and then we're going to do a little bit of implicit differentiation. So the first thing that we wanna do, actually, let me rewrite this with a little bit of space, so, this was a natural log of x to the xth power. So the first thing, I wanna get rid of this x as an exponential, and I wanna be able to apply the product rule somehow. The way we're gonna do that is by taking the natural log of both sides. So take the natural log of both sides, and you might say, well, why is that helpful? Well, if I'm taking the natural log of something to an exponent, well, this is the same thing, actually, let me write this down as a property that you may or may not remember from your logarithmic properties, so if I have, I could write log, or I'll just write natural log, of, if I have natural log of a to the b power, this is the same thing as b times the natural log of a. It's just a standard logarithmic property. And so, by taking the natural log of both sides, this exponent can now become out front and scale the natural log function. So this exponent now, we can bring that out front, and let's just rewrite everything. So we get the natural log of y is equal to, so then let me put that in parentheses, so it's the natural log of y, is equal to x, that x is in blue, x times the natural log times the natural log, of, sorry, x times the natural log of the natural log of x. The natural log of the natural log of x. So, there you have it. By just taking the natural log of both sides and using this logarithmic property, we were able to get that. Now you're saying, well, gee, how is this actually going to be useful for us? Well now, we can implicitly take the derivative of both sides of this. And actually, let me scoot this over to the right a little bit, just so that we can, I have space for my derivative operator. So there you go, scooted that over. And so now, let's take the derivative with respect to x of both sides. So let me, so I'm gonna take the derivative with respect to x of the left-hand side and of the right-hand side, and of the right-hand side. Now, on the left-hand side, this is going to be, essentially, an application of the chain rule. When you learn implicit differentiation, it's really just application of the chain rule. It's the derivative of the outside function with respect to to the inside function, so the natural log of y with respect to y, the derivative of that is just going to be one over y, one over y times the derivative of the inside function with respect to x. So dy dx, dy dx. That is going to be equal to, well this is going to get interesting a little bit. Actually, let me do some stuff on the side a little bit. Let me just, the first thing we wanna do here is just apply the product rule. So it's the derivative of the first expression, so it's just going to be 1 times the second, I guess you'd say, function, so times the natural log of the natural log of x, natural log of x, and then plus the first function, just x, times the derivative of the second function. Times the derivative of the second function. What's the derivative of the natural log of the natural log of x? Let's do that separately. So if I have, if I'm trying to take the derivative, with respect to to x, of the natural log, the natural log of the natural log of x, of the natural log of x, well, here, again, I can apply the chain rule. The derivative of that magenta function with respect to the inside function, that is going to be one over the natural log of x, and then times the derivative of the inside function with respect to x, so times one over x. So this is equal to one over x natural log of x. So the derivative of this second function right over here is one over x natural log of x, one over x natural log of x. Let's see, that x and that x cancels out, and so we are left with, we are left with one over y, and I'll just write all of this in this blue color, so one over y times the derivative of y with respect to x, is equal to, see this is just the natural log of the natural log of x, the natural log of the natural log of x, plus one over the natural log of x, one over the natural log of x. And now, to solve for the derivative, we can multiply both sides by y, so let's do that. So we're gonna multiply that side by y, and we're gonna multiply this side times y, and what are we going to get? Well, on the left-hand side, that's why we multiplied by y, we just have the derivative y with respect to x, derivative of y with respect to x, is equal to, well, y is our original, is all this, is our original thing that we had. Y was equal to the natural log, let me rewrite it over here. Y was equal to the natural log of x to the xth power. So this is, we're essentially multiplying both sides times the natural log of x to the xth power. So this gonna get a little bit, a little bit messy here. So we could just write it the way I wrote it just now, without it being distributed, actually, let me just leave it like that. So it's going to be, and so we deserve a drum roll right now, 'cause this is quite involved, the natural log of the natural log of x plus one over the natural log of x, all of that times the natural log of x to the xth power. So that was quite involved. And if someone said well, what is the derivative of y when x is equal to e? So if someone says what is this equal to when x is equal to e, well, we could evaluate this when x is equal to e. This would be the, and I just made that up just now, so if like the original question wasn't just what is dy dx, if they said what is dy dx when x is equal to e. If that was the original question, then we could evaluate it. So where we just replace all these with e's, so it'd be an e there, an e there, an e there, and an e there, and I just picked the value e 'cause it's easy to evaluate. So that natural log of e is 1, natural log of 1 e to the zeroth power is 1, so all of that just becomes 0. The natural log of e is 1, so this whole expression right over here becomes zero plus one over one, so this becomes one, and then the natural log of e is, the natural log of e is one, and you're gonna have one to the eth power, well you could raise one to any power, and you're just get one. So it's one times one is equal to one. So I just thought it would be fun to try to evaluate that at a value that would be somewhat clean.",math_differential-calculus_dc-chain
" Let's say I'm walking along some trail and there are some trees on the side of the road. And let's just say these are some plants. And these are the barks of the trees-- maybe I should do it in brown-- but you get the idea. These are some plants that are along the side of the road, or at least the stem of the plant or the bark of the tree. And in the background, I have some mountains. Maybe those mountains are several miles away. We know just from experience that if I'm walking-- let me draw myself over here-- we know that if I'm walking this way, the trees look like they're going past me much faster than the mountains. Like I'll just be going past one tree after another. And they'll just whizz past me-- maybe if I'm running. But the mountains don't seem to be moving that quickly. And this idea, that as you change your position the things that are closer to you seem to move more than the things that are further from you, this property is called parallax. And what we're going to do in this video-- and maybe it's especially obvious if you're driving in a car, then the things close to you are whizzing by you, maybe the curve of the street or whatever, while the things that are further away don't seem to be whizzing by you as fast. What I want to do in this video is think about how we can use parallax to figure out how far certain stars are. And what I want to emphasize is that this method is only good for relatively close stars. We don't have instruments sensitive enough yet to use parallax to measure stars that are really, really, really far away. But to think about how this is done, how we use stellar parallax-- just let me write ""stellar"" up here-- how we use stellar parallax, the parallax of stars, to figure out how far away they are, let's think a little bit about our solar system. So here is our sun in the solar system. And here is Earth at one point in the year. And what I want to do is-- and let's just say this is the North Pole, kind of popping out of the screen here. And so the Earth is rotating in that direction. And I also want to think about a star that is obviously outside of our solar system. And I'm really underestimating the distance to this star. As we'll see, or as you might already know, the distance to the nearest star from our solar system is 250,000 times the distance between the Earth and the sun. So if I wanted to draw this to scale-- well, first of all, the Earth would be this unnoticeable dot here-- but you would also, whatever distance this is, you would have to multiply that by 250,000 to get the distance to this nearest star. Anyway, with that said, let's think about what that star would look like from the surface of the Earth. So let me pick a point on the surface. Maybe if we're thinking about North America, we're right there in the northern hemisphere. So let's take that little patch of land and think about how the position of that star would look. So that's the patch of land. Maybe this is my house right over here, jutting out the side of the Earth. Maybe this is me standing. I'm drawing everything sideways because I'm trying to hold this perspective. So this is me looking up. And let's say at this point in time, the way I've drawn this patch, the sun will just be coming over the horizon. So the sun is essentially at sunrise. So let me do my best at drawing the sun from my point of view. Remember, the Earth is rotating in this way-- the way I've drawn it, it's rotating counterclockwise. But from the surface of the Earth it would look like the sun is coming up here. It's rising in the east. But right at that dawn, on this day when the Earth is right over here, what would that star look like? So if you look at this version of the Earth, the star is kind of skewed a little bit-- not straight up, straight up would be this direction, from the point of view of my house-- it is now skewed a little bit closer to the sun. So if you go in this is zoomed-in version, straight up would look something like that. And maybe based on my measurement, it would look like the star is right over there. So it's a little bit skewed towards where the sun is rising, towards the east relative to straight up. Now let's fast-forward six months so that the Earth is on the other side of its orbit from the sun. So let's fast-forward six months. We're over here. And let's wait for a time of day where we are-- essentially that little patch of the Earth is pointed in the same direction, at least in our galaxy, maybe. And if you think about it, if we go back to this patch of Earth, now the Earth is still rotating in that direction. But now the sun is on the west. The sun is going to be right over here. Maybe I'll do it like this just to make it clear. I'll draw this side of the sun with this greenish color. Obviously the sun is not green, but it will make clear that now we're about the sun is going to be over here. The patch is going to be turning away from the sun. So it'll look to that observer on Earth like the sun is setting. So it'll look like the sun is going down over the horizon. But the important thing is, once we're at this point in the year, what will that star look like? Well, if we have this large diagram, we see that the star, relative to straight up, it is now a little bit to the west now, a little bit more on the side of that setting sun. So the star would now look like it is right there. And if we have good enough instruments, we can measure the angle between where that star was six months ago and where it is now. And let's call that angle 2 times theta. And the reason why I call it 2 times theta-- we could call theta the angle between the star and being straight up. So this would be theta, and that would be theta. And I care about that because if I know theta, and if I know the distance from the Earth to the sun, I can then use a little bit of trigonometry to figure out the distance to that star. Because if you think about it, this theta right over here is the same as this angle. So if this is straight up. That is looking straight up into the night sky. This would be the angle theta. If you know that angle from basic trigonometry, or actually even basic geometry, if you say this is a right angle over here, this would be 90 minus theta. And then you could use some basic trigonometry. If you know this distance right here, and you're trying to figure out this distance, the distance to that nearest star, we could say, look, we need a trigonometric function that deals with the opposite angle of what we know. We know this thing right over here. And the adjacent angle-- we already know this thing right over here. So let me call this the Earth-sun distance, or let me just call this d. And we want to figure out x. So some basic trigonometry-- and you might want to do this if you forget the basic trigonometric functions-- SOHCAHTOA. Sine is opposite/hypotenuse. Cosine is adjacent/hypotenuse. Tangent is opposite/adjacent. So the tangent function deals with the two sides of this right triangle that we can now deal with. So we could say that the tangent of 90 minus theta, this angle right over here-- let me write it-- is equal to the opposite side-- is equal to x over the adjacent side, over d. Or another way, if you assume that we know the distance to the sun, you multiply both sides times that distance. You get d times the tangent of 90 minus theta is equal to x. And you can figure out the distance from our solar system to that star. Now I want to make it very, very, very clear-- these are huge distances. I did not draw this to scale. The distance to the nearest star is actually 250,000 times the distance to our sun. So this angle is going to be super, super, super, super small. So you would need to have very good instruments even to measure-- even to observe-- the stellar parallax to the nearest stars. And we're constantly having better instruments-- and actually the Europeans right now are in the process of a mission called Gaia to measure these to enough accuracy that we can start to measure the accurate distance to stars several tens of thousands of light years away. So that'll start to give us a very accurate map of a significant chunk of our galaxy, which is about 100,000 light years in diameter.",science_cosmology-and-astronomy_stellar-life-topic
" We've got the inequality negative x times the expression 2x minus 14 is greater than or equal to 24. So I encar, encourage you to pause this video now and think about what the solution set to this inequality would actually be, and actually plot the solution set on a number line. So I'm assuming you've given a go at it, so let's just try to simplify this a little bit. So on the left hand side we could distribute, we could distribute this negative x, and so if we did that we would get negative 2, negative 2x squared, negative times a negative is a positive, plus 14x is greater than or equal to 24. Now I'm gonna put the, I'm gonna subtract 24 from both sides, just so that we just have a 0 here and then we can think about factoring what we have here on the left. So we have negative 2x squared, plus 14x, I'm gonna subtract 24 from both sides, so it's minus 24 is greater than or equal to, I've subtracted 24 from the right as well, so that's going to be greater than or equal to 0. Now, I don't like, I don't like having this negative 2 out front, so what I wanna do is I wanna divide this left hand side by negative 2, but I can't just divide the left hand side only by negative 2, I have to do divide the right hand side by negative 2 as well. And anytime I multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, it's going to flip the inequality. So if I divide both sides by negative 2, I'm going to be left with x squared, positive x squared minus, so I'm dividing by negative 2, so minus 7x, plus 12. And now since I divided by negative 2, I'm gonna flip this inequality, is less than or equal to zero divided by negative 2 is 0. So that simplified things a good bit, and now let's see if we can factor this quadratic expression. So two numbers whose product is positive 12, so that means they're gonna have the same sign, and whose, and whose sum is negative 7. So if they have the same sign, and their sum is negative 7, that tells us that they're both going to be negative. And let's see, negative 3 and negative 4 seem to fit the bill. Their product is positive 12. Their sum is negative 7. So we could write this as x minus 3 times x minus 4, is going to be less than or equal to 0. So now this is the point that we're gonna do a little bit of interesting logic. If the product of two things is less than, is less than or equal to 0, what does that tell us, tell what do we know about it? Well, that tells us that either, either one or both of them is 0, or they have different signs. The only way that you're gonna get less than 0 is if one is positive and the other is negative, or one is negative and the other is positive. So our 1 is negative, is that they have different signs. So let's write that down, let's write that down. So either, either x minus 3, x minus 3 is less than or, less than, either x minus 3 is less than or equal to 0 and, and x minus 4 is greater than or equal to 0, x minus 4 is greater than or equal to 0, so notice, note this one is non positive, this one is non negative, they're either equal to 0 or they are have different signs. So that's one situation, or, or the other way around, or x minus 3 is non negative, it's greater than or equal to 0, and x minus 4 is non positive, x minus 4 is less than or equal to 0. Once again, they're either zero or different signs, that's all I'm doing with this little with this little logic work right over here. So what are these, what is this, what is this simplified to? So x minus 3 less than or equal to 0, add 3 to both sides, you get x is less than or equal to 3. And, and x minus 4 is greater than or equal to 0. If you add 4 to both sides of this, you get x is greater than or equal to 4. So what values of x are going to be less than or equal to 3, and greater than or equal to 4? Well anything that's less than or equal to 3 is not going to be greater than or equal to 4 and anything that's greater than or equal to 4 is not going to be less than or equal to 3. So there's no x, there's no x value that can satisfy this situation right over here, there's no X value that will result in this one being negative, and this one being, or this one being non positive and this one being non negative. So let's go to this one right over here. So if we add 3 to both sides, we get x is greater than or equal to 3 and, and we get adding 4 to both sides, x is less than or equal to 4. Now does this make sense, that something could be greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 4? Sure, for example, well 3 is greater than or equal to 3 and is less than or equal to 4, 4 is greater than or equal to 3 and it's less than or equal to 4 and anything in between. So we can plot the solution set here. So this is actually all that matters. Cuz this one, there's no situation which that would've been true. So this is the only thing, this is the only thing that's gonna make this or part true. This part is always going to be false. So if we wanted to make the solution set, it would look something like this. So if this is our possible values of x. So let's say that that is 0, so this is 1, 2, 3, and 4, 3 and 4, 3 and 4, x could be greater than or equal to 3, so it's greater than or equal to 3. But it's also let, it also has to be less than or equal to 4 so we can't just go all past 4. Also, less than or equal, less is since it's, less than or equal we can color in these dots, less than or equal to 4. So anything in this range, including 3 and 4, that's why we circled in the dots, this would satisfy this equation here. And if you wanted to think about it visually, hey, you know we know that this type of thing, we know that this type of thing, or this type of thing, this type of thing right over here, these are, these are parabola's. So how would that relate to this little solution set that we just thought about right over here? Well if you look at let's, let's just look at one of these. Let's say we went to, let's say we went to this form right over here. So all, everything we did, this is just another way of thinking about negative 2x squared plus 14x minus 24 is greater than or equal to 0. So this right over here, we have a negative coefficient on the x squared term, that's going to be a downward opening parabola. So when is that greater than or equal to 0? So if, if we though about the downward opening parabola, it could might look something like this, it might look something like this if we're now thinking in 2 dimensions. And this is the, this is the, if you think of this as the Y axis right over here. So when is that greater than or equal to 0? Well it's greater than or equal to 0, it's above the X axis in this range for x right over here. So that's one way of thinking about it. If we though about it from the point of view, not of that parabola, not of that parabola, but this parabola right over here, when is x squared minus 7x plus 12 less than or equal to 0? Well this is gonna be an up, upward opening parabola. So if it has a positive coefficient here, so this problem might look something like this, might look something like this, when is it less than or equal to 0? Well once again, once again it's less than or equal to 0 in that same range.",math_algebra-home_alg-quadratics
"  At some point in time, you've seen someone walking their dog, and their dog decides to pee on a fire hydrant. Now, this is my attempt to draw a fire hydrant, but you see the dog, and he pees on this fire hydrant. Here's the pee, it's coming, and it splashed all over the place. Why is the dog peeing on the fire hydrant? You might have heard that dogs pee on fire hydrants in order to mark their territory. How exactly is it that they're able to mark their territory? There are particular molecules that are released in the urine, and these molecules can be scented, can be sensed by other animals through their nose. These molecules are known as pheromones, pheromones. Now, we can think of pheromones as specialized olfactory cues. In a previous video, we spoke about how we're able to smell things. Well, pheromones, not only are we able to smell them, and animals in particular are able to smell them, but they also cause some sort of response in the other animal that's smelling them. Basically, we could think of a pheromone as a chemical signal, chemical signal, that is released by one member of a species, so for example, the dog, and is sensed another member of the species, and it triggers an innate response. Pheromones are really important in animals, particularly insects. In insects, they have been linked to mating, to fighting, and also in chemical communications. Bees use pheromones, dogs use pheromones, [unintelligible] use pheromones to mark their territories and basically communicate with other members of the species. This is what pheromones are in a nutshell. Now we're going to go into a little bit of the anatomy and also how, at a molecular level, pheromones work. In a previous video, we went into the olfactory system, and we talked about the olfactory epithelium. Let me just go ahead, and let's imagine that this is the skull of a mouse. Here is a mouse skull, here are its teeth, and here is its nose. This is just the skull. This is the nose. Normally, there would be a little bit of flesh here, but basically, here is the nose, and air comes in, and it moves through the nasal passage, and there is a part of the nasal passage that is known as the olfactory epithelium, so olfactory epithelium. The olfactory epithelium is sensitive to various molecules. There is a specialized part of the olfactory epithelium which is up here in the mouse, and this is known as an accessory olfactory epithelium, accessory olfactory epithelium. The accessory olfactory epithelium actually sends projections to a accessory olfactory bulb. This is the accessory olfactory bulb. The olfactory epithelium sends information to ... [unintelligible] Normal olfactory epithelium sends its information to the olfactory bulb, which is olfactory bulb, but the accessory olfactory epithelium sends information to the accessory olfactory bulb. Let's look at the particular cells in the accessory olfactory epithelium that are responsive to pheromones. Let's look a little bit more closely at the accessory olfactory epithelium. Within the accessory olfactory epithelium, we have a structure known as a vomeronasal system. We got this one zone over here, and then we have beneath it another zone. Let's imagine that this part up here is the nasal passage, so this is the nasal passage, and then over here are all the axons of the various sensory cells that will eventually go to the brain via the accessory olfactory bulb. Within this vomeronasal system, which I will label, vomeronasal system, there are different cells. There are some cells that are situated down here, and they actually send a projection all the way up to this top zone over here. We got these cells in this, since they're situated underneath this bottom zone, are known as basal cells. There are other cells that are over here, and they just have short little projections, and these are known as apical cells. Apical cells are in yellow. This is apical, and this over here is a basal cell. These cells, similar to regular olfactory neurons, will have little receptors at the very tips of their projections, and these receptors will be sensitive to different molecules or pheromones. Let's imagine that in the urine of that dog that peed on the fire hydrant, there is a little molecule. We'll draw it as a little triangle. That triangle will come in, and it might activate a receptor on this basal cell over here. When it does activate this cell, this basal cell will send a axon through the accessory olfactory epithelium and then eventually to the accessory olfactory bulb, so accessory olfactory bulb, and then from there, it will synapse onto a glomerulus and then to a mitral or tufted cell, and then that mitral or tufted cell will send a axon to the brain. There are many of these vomeronasal systems throughout the accessory olfactory bulb here. I just drew one. But basically, again, what we have is we have specialized cells that are responsible with one particular type of molecule that will send little axons that eventually go to the accessory olfactory bulb. All the axons will synapse into one particular location known as a glomerulus. Once these cells reach the accessory olfactory bulb and synapse onto a glomerulus, they will then synapse onto a mitral or tufted cell, and that mitral or tufted cell will actually send a axon to a part of the brain known as the amygdala, amygdala. The amygdala is responsible for a host of things, but it's particularly known for its involvement in emotion and aggression and mating and things like that. So basically, by having various cells respond to various pheromones in the environment, an animal is able to control its behavior via this pathway to the amygdala based on these extracellular cues in the environment. Based on these pheromones, a pheromone will bind, they will cause some kind of cell to fire, and that cell will eventually reach the amygdala to cause a behavioral response in the animal. Now signal transduction, so this part right here, this is where the receptor, the molecule binds to the receptor. This causes a signal to be transduced in the particular sensory neuron. This signal transduction is exactly the same as what happens in regular olfaction, where there is a receptor. The receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor. When that receptor is activated, it causes this cell to de-polarize and fire [unintelligible]. Now interestingly, in humans, we have evolved to, to rely very little on pheromones. We do have a vomeronasal organ. However, we do not have an accessory olfactory bulb, so we rely very little on pheromones.",science_health-and-medicine_nervous-system-and-sensory-infor
" -  Stacy wants to find the derivative of f of x equals x squared plus one at the point x equals two. Her table below shows the average rate of change of f over the intervals from x to two or from two to x, and these are closed intervals, for x-values that get increasingly closer to two. so they get-- so we're talking about the average rate of change of f over these closed intervals for x-values that get increasingly closer to two. It looks like we're going to be dealing with some type of a limit, or we're trying to calculate some type of a limit, or approximate some type of a limit. Let's read this data here. These are the x values and she's trying to find the average rate of change between each of these x-values and two, or the average rate of change of the function between when x is-- one of these x values and two, and then she has the average rate of change that she precalculated, so we don't have to get a calculator out or anything like that, and just as a reminder, how did she calculate this 3.9? Well, they tell us. She took f of 1.9, what does the function equal when x is 1.9? From that, she subtracted what is the value of the function when f is equal to two, so that's really our change in f, and she divided it by the x, which is 1.9, minus two, so change in f over change in x. What is the average rate of change of our function over that interval? She did it between 1.9 and two, she got 3.9. Then she gets closer to two, so now she's doing it between 1.99 and two and it becomes 3.99, it looks like it's getting closer to four. She gets even closer to two and the average rate of change gets even closer to four, and then she goes on the other side of two, you could view it as this is approaching, this is-- this is approaching-- this is x approaching two from the left hand side, and this is x approaching two from the right hand side. When it's 2.1, the average rate of change is 4.1. When it's 2.01, once again, we're getting closer to two, we're getting closer to two, the average rate of change is getting closer to four. The closer we get to two, the closer the average rate of change gets to four. What this data is really helping us approximate it's really saying, okay, the average rate of change we know is f of x minus f of two, over x minus two, but what we're really thinking about is, well what is the limit as x approaches two right over here? That's what this data is helping us to get at, and it looks like this limit is equal to four. They give us it in here, it says, ""Look, the closer that x gets to two ""from either the left hand side or the right hand side, ""the closer that this expression right over here, ""which is this number, gets to four."" You might recognize, this is one of the definitions of a derivative. This is one of the definitions of a derivative. This right over here would be f prime of two, the derivative at x equals two is equal to the limit as x approaches two of all of this business. There's other ways to express a derivative as a limit but this is one of them. There you go, from the table, what does the derivative of f of x equals x squared plus one at x equals two appear to be? Well, the derivative at x equals two appears to be equal to four, and we're done.",math_in-in-grade-11-ncert_in-in-class11-derivatives
" - We're told that cars A, B, and C are traveling at constant speeds and they say select the car that travels the fastest and we have these three scenarios here. So, I encourage you to pause this video and try to figure out which of these three cars is traveling the fastest, car A, car B, or car C. Alright, now, let's work through this together. So, car A, they clearly just give its speed, it's 50 kilometers per hour. Now, let's see, car B travels the distance of D kilometers in H hours based on the equation 55h is equal to D. Alright, now, let's see if we can translate this somehow into kilometers per hour. So, 55h is equal to D or we could say D is equal to 55H and here I'm doing, this is this scenario right over here, not scenario A. And so, another way to think about it is distance divided by time, so if we divide both sides by hours, we would have distance divided by time, and so if we have D over H, then we would just be left with 55 on the right hand side. All I did is I divided both sides by H. Now, this is distance divided by time, so the units here are going to be, we're assuming, and it tells us D is in kilometers, H is in hours, so the units here are going to be kilometers per hour. So, car B is going 55 kilometers per hour while car A is only going 50 kilometers per hour. So, so far, car B is the fastest. Now, car C travels 135 kilometers in three hours. Well, let's just get the hourly rate or I guess you could say the unit rate. So, 135 kilometers in three hours, and so we can get the rate per hour, so 135 divided by three is what? That is going to be, let's do it in our head, I think it's 45 but let me just verify that, three goes into 135, three goes into 13 four times, four times three is 12. You subtract, you get, yep, three goes into 15 five times, five times three is 15. Subtract zero. So, this is equal to 45 kilometers per hour. So, car A is 50 kilometers per hour, car B is 55 kilometers per hour, car C is 45 kilometers per hour, so car B is the fastest. Let's do another example. So, here, we're asked which relationships have the same constant of proportionality between Y and X as the equation 3y is equal to 27x. And we have three choices here and actually there's two more below the fold, but just for the three that you see, pause the video and see which of these have the same constant of proportionality as 3y is equal to 27x. Alright, now let's work through this together. So, first, let's figure out this constant of proportionality with 3y is equal to 27x. One way to figure out the constant of proportionality is you can get it in the form Y is equal to R times X where R would be your constant of proportionality. So, let's do that. Well, to get it in that form, you just divide both sides by three, divide both sides by three, and you are left with Y is equal to 27 divided by three is 9x. So, our constant of proportionality that we're looking for is nine. Well, that's exactly what choice A right over here is, Y is equal to 9x, constant of proportionality is nine. So, I like that answer. Now, 2y is equal to 18x, if we were to solve for Y on the left hand side, divide both sides by two, you're gonna get Y, Y is equal to 9x again. Once again, same constant of proportionality. So, B is a good choice. Now, let's see over here. When X is equal to one, Y is equal to nine. Or another way to think about it is Y, in this case, is nine times X. So, this is the point one, comma, nine, and so you see that Y is nine times X, Y is nine times X. So, our constant of proportionality again is equal to nine. So, actually, the three that we can see on screen, and they say choose three, so these are going to be our three answers. Well, let's just verify that the other two choices that you don't see don't have a constant of proportionality of nine. Constant of propor, propor. (laughs) Trouble saying that, alright. Okay. So, here, we're given the relationship between X and Y at a table. And so, to go from three to one third, let's see, to go from three to one third, what do you multiply by? Well, to go from three to one third, you multiply by one ninth. To go from six to two thirds, you multiply by one ninth, or another way to think about it, you divide by nine. So, here, our constant of proportionality is one ninth, not nine. Y is equal to one ninth times X. Now, over here, let's see, to go from two to 18, you do multiply by nine, so that's interesting. And then, here, but to go from four to 27, you don't multiply by nine, you're multiplying by something other than nine. And then to go from six to 36, you're multiplying by six. So, this last table, it's not even a proportional relationship, much less have the same constant of proportionality.",math_7th-engage-ny_engage-7th-module-1
" -  Let's get a little practice doing the Khan Academy exercise Marking Data on Line Plots. So right over here it says, ""Tessa measured the distance ""from her house to several locations ""to the nearest half kilometer."" All right, and so they have different locations and it tells us the distance from her house to each of these locations. So from her house to the school is 3 1/2 kilometers, from the library is 5 1/2 kilometers, to the park is two kilometers, the movie theater is four kilometers, to the post office, 5 1/2 kilometers. Then they ask us, ""How many dots ""should be on a line plot of these measurements?"" So a line plot, and they have one down here, a line plot, this is literally a number line and what we do is we put as many dots there are at a certain point in the line. So if we have two data points at 5 1/2 we would put two dots right over there, but we'll get to that in a second. They're just asking us how many dots should be on the line plot of these measurements? Well, we should make a dot for each of these data points and there are one, two, three, four, five data points here. So there's five data points that I'm going to want to put on my line plot. Then they say, ""Create a line plot ""that shows all of the measurements. ""Click above the marking on the number line ""that matches each measurement. ""Click higher to add more dots above the same marking. ""Click lower to add fewer dots."" So they say that the distance from the school to Tessa's house is 3 1/2 kilometers so we would want to put a dot at 3 1/2 and I do that just by clicking, clicking right over there, 3 1/2. So that's one data point at 3 1/2. Half way between three and four. Let's do it for the next ones. 5 1/2, that's the distance from the library to her house. 5 1/2, then we have two kilometers. Two kilometers, distance from ... Two kilometers was the distance from the park to her house. Then the movie theater if four kilometers. I wish you could see it all in one screen. Four kilometers. And then the post office is also 5 1/2 kilometers. So you actually have two data points at 5 1/2 kilometers. So right here I've just constructed a line plot. At different points on the number line I'm showing how many data points we have. So we have one data point at two kilometers, one at 3 1/2 kilometers, one at four kilometers, and two at 5 1/2 kilometers. Now notice, we said we would have five dots when we have one, two, three, four, five. One for each data point. Let's do this one more time. Let's check and make sure we got it right. Now let's do one more. All right, measure the length ... Measure the length of each line to the nearest quarter inch to collect data for the line plot below. To make your measurements, drag the ruler on top of the lines. Align the left end of the ruler with the left end of the lines then read the length of each line from the right end of the line. All right, so really I just wanna measure ... I just wanna measure, oh this is ... I didn't mean to tilt it like that. I just wanna measure each of these lines. So this green line right over here looks like it is six and this is split into one, two, three, four. It looks like it's 6 3/4ths. 6 3/4ths, the green line is 6 3/4ths inches long. So we have one data point at 6 3/4ths. So I'll put that right over there. Then we have the red line is ... Let's see, this is 7 2/4ths or 7 1/2. It's halfway between seven and eight. So 7 2/4ths or 7 1/2, so halfway between seven and eight is right over there. Then finally I have the purple line. The purple line, let's see. That is 8 3/4ths inches long. Notice I aligned it right at the beginning right over there and it goes all the way to eight and one, two, three out of the four. 8 3/4ths inches long, so let me, 8 3/4ths. So there you go. I have one line that was 6 3/4ths, one line that was 7 2/4ths or 7 1/2 and then one line that's 8 3/4ths inches long. Let's check our answer. Let's do one more. This is actually a lot of fun. All right, we gotta measure things again. So let's see, the green line. Green line is exactly three inches long, three inches long so let's plot it right over there. Then we have the red line is exactly, let's see, 3 3/4ths inches long. 3 3/4ths, let's put a dot right over there. Then the purple line is three inches long as well. So I have another data point at three inches. So two of the lines were three inches and one of them is 3 3/4ths and we are ... And we're done.",math_4th-grade-foundations-engageny_4th-m5-engage-ny-foundations
" -  In ancient Egypt, women who questioned whether they were pregt or not were told to urinate on bags of wheat and barely over the course of several days. And if the wheat sprouted, the woman was having a girl and if the barley sprouted, she was having a boy, and if neither sprouted, she wasn't pregt. So I guess you could say that the question of ""Am I pregt?"" is as old as time. And the craziest thing about that story is that they tested it in the 60s and they found out that it worked 70% of the time. Okay, so how do we tell if a woman is pregt in the age of modern medicine, so today? Well, there are a few different signs of pregcy and the signs of pregcy are divided into three different groups. So first, there are the presumptive, the presumptive, the presumptive signs of pregcy and these are changes that are experienced by the woman that make her think that she might be pregt. And then the second group of signs are the probable signs. The probable, probable signs of pregcy, which are changes that are seen on physical exam that make the examiner suspect that the woman might be pregt. And then finally, there are the positive signs of pregcy. The positive signs of pregcy, or signs that can only and only be explained by pregcy. Alright, so let's start with the presumptive signs. So we're talking about signs that make the woman think she's pregt. And the number one sign has to be a missed period. And the medical term for that is amenorrhea. The medical term for a missed period is amenorrhea. And if you've heard enough of these Latin words, you may have picked up that putting an A in front of a word means lack of. So this is lack of menses. And you know I think it's really important that you understand why the period is missed in pregcy. So really briefly, over here you have a uterus and the uterus has layers. but the inner most layer, the endometrium, is what we're concerned with right now. And off to the side we have the ovary, which has lots of different follicles in it, and inside each follicle is an egg. So really, just as 50,000 foot view of things, the whole purpose of the menstrual cycle is to select one of these follicles, one of these follicles every menstrual cycle for development. So one of these follicles is selected to grow and develop. And as it does that, as it grows and develops, it secretes hormones, specifically estradiol, so it specifically secretes estradiol, which is a type of estrogen. And that estradiol acts on the uterus and it causes this inner lining of the uterus, the endometrium to proliferate and to become thicker. And then, in the middle of the menstrual cycle, this one mature follicle ruptures and it releases the egg that's inside it. And that event, that event where the follicle ruptures and releases the egg inside of it, is referred to as ovulation. After ovulation, the egg that's released travels down the fallopian tube, hopefully to find a sperm to fertilize it. But meanwhile, this ruptured follicle that's left behind over here, which is now referred to as the corpus luteum, so the corpus luteum takes this sort of waiting period while it's sitting around waiting for the egg to be fertilized to start producing lots of progesterone. So progesterone is another hormone that the corpus luteum produces. And again, the progesterone acts on the endometrium of the uterus to increase the growth of glands and cause the storage of glycogen. And all of this is done to prepare the endometrium, to prepare it for the implantation of an embryo. Alright, so what does any of this have to do with a period? Well, if that egg that's hanging out over there doesn't get fertilized, the corpus luteum recognizes that and it says, ""Well, I guess there's no reason ""to prepare this endometrium for implantation."" So it stops making progesterone. And without the progesterone, the endometrium starts to slough off. And that sloughing off of endometrium is what's referred to as a period. But, if instead the egg does become fertilized, it will implant into the uterus. And when it implants into the uterus, it makes this hormone called human, called human, human chorionic chorionic gonado, gonadotropin, human chorionic gonadotropin. Usually it's just referred to as HCG. And human chorionic gonadotropin tells the corpus luteum to stay alive and to keep making progesterone, and that progesterone in turn keeps the endometrium alive and healthy so that it doesn't slough off and you don't end up with a period. So that is why, when an egg becomes fertilized, when you become pregt, you miss a period. So that's a lot of information. Now, a lot of the hormones that I just talked about account for the other presumptive signs of pregcy. So nausea and vomiting, for example. Lots of people wonder why do you become so nauseous during pregcy and one of the reasons for the nausea is progesterone. So progesterone is really good at relaxing smooth muscle. And that's smooth muscle throughout the entire body, including the smooth muscle of the GI tract. And if you can imagine, if the smooth muscle of the GI tract is relaxed instead of contracting, food isn't gonna make it's way down the GI tract like it should. It kinda just sits there and it's... and that piling up of food, that stasis of food, causes nausea. And, in addition to all of the estrogen and progesterone, the placenta makes a hormone called melanocyte stimulating hormone. It's not the most important hormone of pregcy, but it makes this hormone called melanocyte stimulating hormone which does exactly what the name implies, it stimulates the melanocytes, which are the pigment cells in your skin. So hyper pigmentation is not an uncommon sign in pregcy. So darkening of the skin can also occur as a sign in pregcy. And that could be hyper pigmentation of the face. So the hyper pigmentation of the face is called melasma, and a lot of people refer to it as the mask of pregcy. So you can see dark, blotchy spots on the face which typically go away within a year after the pregcy is over, but still it can be a sign early on in the pregcy. Linea nigra is another manifestation of that hyper pigmentation. So linea means line and nigra means black, right? So it's a dark line that tends to appear down the middle of the abdomen. And also you can see darkening of the areola of the breasts. So that's another manifestation of the hyper pigmentation. And speaking of the breast, many women early on in the pregcy experience breast tenderness. And again, that's due to the effects of estrogen and progesterone causing growth of the glands inside the breast. And then somewhere around 12 to 14 weeks into the pregcy, women can start to experience fetal movements for the very first time and they're commonly described as being flutter-like, so it feels like a flutter. And those movements are referring to as quickening. Quickening. Right, so quickening. So those are the presumptive signs of pregcy. So what about the probable signs of pregcy? Well first there's uterine enlargement. So if the examiner feels an enlarged uterus, that's a pretty big clue that the woman might be pregt. And of course a positive pregcy test is another big sign. So most pregcy tests, whether they're blood tests or whether they're urine tests, detect beta HCG, they detect that human chorionic gonadotropin. And beta HCG is remember, made after the implantation occurs and it can be detected in the urine or in the blood anywhere between 10 to 14 days after conception. And I think there tends to be this thought that blood pregcy tests are way more accurtate than urine tests that are done at home. But that's not necessarily true. So there have been a few studies that have shown that a urine pregcy test is pretty much as accurate as a blood test, but it's improper usage or not correctly following instructions at home that tend to result in an inaccurate home pregcy test. And you might be wondering why a positive pregcy test isn't a positive sign of pregcy. Why is it a probable sign of pregcy? And it's because you can actually have a false positive pregcy test. And because there are certain types of cancer that also produce HCG, so as you can imagine that would also lead to a positive pregcy test in the absence of a pregcy. Alright, now as far as the remainder of the probable signs of pregcy, keep in mind that during pregcy the blood flow to the entire reproductive tract, including the uterus and the vagina drastically increases. There are more blood vessels growing in these organs and more of mom's blood is being directed this way. And that makes these tissues really quite loose and swollen and elastic. So, for example, the tip of the cervix becomes soft and swollen and that can be seen 1or it can be felt by an examiner. 1And that softening of the tip of the cervix 1is referred to as Goodell's sign. 1It's referred to as Goodell's sign, 1so it's something an examiner can see that would 1sort of indicate that the woman might be pregt. 1And all of those blood vessels give the cervix 1and the vagina a violet, bluish color 1which again can be seen during an exam. 1And that's referred to as Chadwick's sign. 1It refers to the bluish tinge 1of the vagina and the cervix. 1And eventually, actually, an examiner 1can feel the presence of the fetus. 1So, there is this maneuver where 1the examiner can insert their finger 1through the vagina and gently tap upwards, 1which causes the fetus to rise. 1And then the fetus sinks and then the examiner 1feels a gentle tap back on their finger. 1And that technique of gently, sort of bouncing 1the floating fetus is referred to as ballottement. 1It's referred to as ballott, 1as ballottement. 1So those are the probable signs of pregcy, 1leaving us with the positive signs of pregcy, 1which are signs that can only and only 1be explained by pregcy. 1So they include visualizing the fetus, 1so direct visualization of the fetus either 1through ultrasound, x-ray. 1Also hearing fetal heart tones. 1Hearing fetal heart tones and feeling fetal movements. 1Feeling fetal movements. 1So visualizing the fetus, hearing 1the fetal heart tones, and feeling fetal movements 1are signs that are absolutely diagnostic of pregcy. 1They can't be explained by anything else. 1Alright, so those are some of the different ways 1we can tell if a woman is pregt, 1which just shows you that we've come a pretty far way 1from the days of urinating on bags of barley and wheat.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" - Let's talk a little bit about exocytosis, which is how the cell is able to release larger molecules that might be used by the rest of the body. Other cells, or maybe it's going to be part of the extracellular matrix. And to understand how this works, it's really the reverse of endocytosis, we're going to go and produce some proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, this is our classic example. Those proteins are then going to bud off, in their own little vesicles, which then merge with the golgi apparatus where they are further processed. So they're processed in the golgi apparatus, right over here, and then eventually they're going to bud off of the golgi apparatus in new vesicles, and those vesicles are going to make their way over to the cell's outer membrane, the plasma membrane and the membranes of the vesicles are going to merge with the membrane of the cell and in doing so, they're going to release their contents. And this is classic exocytosis, there are other cases where maybe it merges partially, releases the contents and then buds back is called the ""kiss and run"" method of exocytosis, but the classic one is it merges with the membrane. We can look at this, this membrane after the vesicle's membrane has merged with the plasma membrane, the membrane might look like this. So if the vesicle, let me do the vesicle's membrane in orange, if the vesicle's membrane is at an orange, well now it has merged like this and it has released its contents. It has released the protein to be used someplace else, someplace else in the body. And I want to be clear, this membrane, and I talk about it many times in many other videos, even though I've drawn it as one line right over here, this is going to be a phospholipid bilayer, so if we were to zoom in, it would look like this. It's a phospholipid bilayer. So these are some of the phospholipids that were part of the original part of the original membrane and then we also, in my little box, I get some of the ones that are part of, or that were part of the vesicle that was holding that protein. That were part of the vesicle that was holding the protein. So I really want to stress I want to really stress these lines that I'm drawing these are bilayers of phospholilpids. And all of these lines, these membranes that you see, these are all bilayers of phospholipids. Just to make sure that we are visualizing this correct. And that's what exocytosis is and one thing that I find interesting is when you first learn about it you see it diagrammed like this and you just assume, okay, well, these bubbles of these with these membranes they just randomly must float eventually to the membrane where they get merged and then they release their contents. But actually it isn't that chaotic. They actually can sit on tracks so they actually can sit on tracks. Remember we talked about the cytoskeleton which isn't drawn enough probably because it makes drawings really messy but whenever we think about a cell there's all this structure to it. There's all this structure to it, microtubules, microfilaments, intermediate filaments, all of these things over here that not only provide structure to the cell, but they can be used to transport. And these vesicles these vesicles can actually ride on these structures and you could actually have motor proteins that are using ATP to actively push the vesicle containing its contents so this is a kind of transportation. It's really like a factory to push them towards the membrane so that they can be released. So whenever I think about it, it's fascinating 'cause I always talk about these cells being a universe unto themselves. And they aren't just these blobs, they have all of these structures, there's all of these proteins that are really on an unbelievably small scale able to do these fairly intricate processes. So what I just showed you, once again, this is classic exocytosis, you'll see it when you have proteins, lipids, being produced by the cell that need to be released somehow. They're also famously used in neurons, the chemical signal, when you go from one neuron to another, you have exocytosis of neurotransmitters that will trigger the next neuron. So these are very, very important processes. Our bodies would not function properly or, wouldn't function at all, if we did not have exocytosis.",science_biology_membranes-and-transport

" So let's say I have a function of x and y; f of x and y is equal to x plus y squared. If I try to draw that, let's see if I can have a good attempt at it. That is my y axis-- I'm going to do a little perspective here --this is my x axis-- I make do the negative x and y axis, could do it in that direction --this is my x axis here. And if I were to graph this when y is 0, it's going to be just a-- let me draw it in yellow --is going to be just a straight line that looks something like that. And then for any given actually, we're going to have a parabola in y. y is going to look something like that. I'm just going to it in the positive quadrant. It's going to look something like that. It'll actually, when you go into the negative y, you're going to see the other half of the parabola, but I'm not going to worry about it too much. So you're going to have this surface. it looks something like that. Maybe I'll do to another attempt at drawing it. But this is our ceiling we're going to deal with again. And then I'm going to have a path in the xy plane. I'm going to start at the point 2 comma 0. x is equal to 2, y is 0. And I'm going to travel, just like we did in the last video, I'm going to travel along a circle, but this time the circle's going to have of radius 2. Move counter clockwise in that circle. This is on the xy plane, just to be able to visualize it properly. So this right here's a point 0, 2. And I'm going to come back along the y axis. This is my path; I'm going to come back along the y access and then so I look a left here, and then I'm going to take another left here in and come back along the x axis. I drew it in these two shades of green. That is my contour. And what I want to do is I want to evaluate the surface area of essentially this little building that has the roof of f of xy is equal to x plus y squared, and I want to find the surface area of its walls. So you'll have this wall right here, whose base is the x axis. Then you're going to have this wall, which is along the curve; it's going to look something like kind of funky wall on that curved side right there. I'll try my best effort to try to-- it's going to be curving way up like that and then along the y axis. It's going to have like a half a parabolic wall right there. I'll do that back wall along the y axis. I'll do that in orange, I'll use magenta. That is the back wall along the y axis. Then you have this front wall along the x axis. And then you have this weird curvy curtain or wall-- do that maybe in blue --that goes along this curve right here, this part of a circle of radius 2. So hopefully you get that visualization. It's a little harder; I'm not using any graphic program at this time. But I want to figure out the surface area, the combined surface area of these three walls. And in very simple notation we could say, well, the surface area of those walls-- of this wall plus that wall plus that wall --is going to be equal to the line integral along this curve, or along this contour-- however you want to call it --of f of xy,-- so that's x plus y squared --ds, where ds is just a little length along our contour. And since this is a closed loop, we'll call this a closed line interval. And we'll sometimes see this notation right here. Often you'll see that in physics books. And we'll be dealing with a lot more. And we'll put a circle on the interval sign. And all that means is that the contour we're dealing with is a closed contour; we get back to where we started from. But how do we solve this thing? A good place to start is to just to find the contour itself. And just to simply it, we're going to divide it into three pieces and it essentially just do three separate line integrals. Because you know, this isn't a very continuous contour. so the first part. Let's do this first part of the curve where we're going along a circle of radius 2. And that's pretty easy to construct if we have x-- let me do each part of the contour in a different color, so if I do orange this part of the contour --if we say that x is equal 2 cosine of t and y is equal to 2 sine of t and if we say that t-- and this is really just building off what we saw on the last video --if we say that t-- and that this is from t is a greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to pi over 2 --t is essentially going to be the angle that we're going along the circle right here. This will actually describe this path. And if you know, how I constructed this is little confusing, you might want to review the video on parametric equations. So this is the first part of our path. So if we just wanted to find the surface area of that wall right there, we know we're going to have to find dx, dt and dy, dt. So let's get that out of the way right now. So if we say dx, dt is going to be equal to minus 2, sine of t, dy, dy is going to be equal to 2 cosine of t; just the derivatives of these. We've seen that many times before. So it we want this orange wall's surface area, we can take the integral-- and if any of this is confusing, there are two videos before this where we kind of derive this formula --but we could take the integral from t is equal to 0 to pi over 2 our function of x plus y squared and then times the ds. So x plus y squared will give the height of each little block. And then we want to get the width of each little block, which is ds, but we know that we can rewrite the ds as the square root-- give myself some room right here --of dx of the derivative of x with respect to t squared-- so that is minus 2 sine of t squared --plus the derivative of y with respect to t squared, dt. This will give us the orange section, and then we can worry about the other two walls. And so how can we simplify this? Well, this is going to be equal to the integral from 0 to pi over 2 of x plus y squared. And actually, let me write everything in terms of t. So x is equal to 2 cosine of t. So let me write that down. So it's 2 cosine of t plus y, which is 2 sine of t, and we're going to square everything. And then all of that times this crazy radical. Right now it looks like a hard antiderivative or integral to solve, but I we'll find out it's not too bad. This is going to be equal to 4 sine squared of t plus 4 cosine squared of t. We can factor a 4 out. I don't want to forget the dt. This over here-- let me just simplify this expression so I don't have to keep rewriting it. That is the same thing is the square root of 4 times sine squared of t plus cosine squared of t. We know what that is: that's just 1. So this whole thing just simplifies to the square root of 4, which is just 2. So this whole thing simplifies to 2, which is nice for solving our antiderivative. That means simplifying things a lot. So this whole thing simplifies down to-- I'll do it over here. I don't want to waste too much space; I have two more walls to figure out --the integral from t is equal to 0 to pi over 2. I want to make it very clear. I just chose the simplest parametrization I could for x and y. But I could have picked other parametrizations, but then I would have had to change t accordingly. So as long as you're consistent with how you do it, it should all work out. There isn't just one parametrization for this curve; it's kind of depending on how fast you want to go along the curve. Watch the parametric functions videos if you want a little bit more depth on that. Anyway, this thing simplifies. We have a 2 here; 2 times cosine of t, that's 4 cosine of t. And then here we have 2 sine squared sine of t squared. So that's 4 sine squared of t. And then we have to multiply times this 2 again, so that gives us an 8. 8 time sine squared of t, dt. And then you know, sine squared of t; that looks like a tough thing to find the antiderivative for, but we can remember that sine squared of, really anything-- we could say sine squared of u is equal to 1/2 half times 1 minus cosine of 2u. So we can reuse this identity. I can try the t here; sine squared of t is equal to 1/2 times 1 minus cosine of 2t. Let me rewrite it that way because that'll make the integral a lot easier to solve. So we get integral from 0 the pi over 2-- and actually I could break up, well I won't break it up --of 4 cosine of t plus 8 times this thing. 8 times this thing; this is the same thing as sine squared of t. So 8 times this-- 8 times 1/2 is 4 --4 times 1 minus cosine 1of 2t-- just use a little trig identity there --and 1all of that dt. 1Now this should be reasonably straight forward to get 1the antiderivative of. 1Let's just take it. 1The antiderivative of this is antiderivative of cosine 1of t; that's a sine of t. 1The derivative of sine is cosine. 1So this is going to be 4 sine of t-- the scalars don't affect 1anything --and then, well let me just distribute this 4. 1So this is 4 times 1 which is 4 minus 4 cosine of 2t. 1So the antiderivative of 4 is 4t-- plus 4t --and then the 1antiderivative of minus 4 cosine of u00b5 t? 1Let's see it's going to be sine of 2t. 1The derivative of sine of 2t is 2 cosine of 2t. 1We're going to have to have a minus sign there, and put a 2 1there, and now it should work out. 1What's the derivative of minus 2 sine of t? 1Take the derivative of the inside 2 times 1minus 2 is minus 4. 1And the derivative of sine of 2t with respect to 12t is cosine of 2t. 1So there we go; we've figured out our antiderivative. 1Now we evaluate it from 0 the pi over 2. 1And what do we get? 1We get 4 sine-- let me write this down, for I don't want to 1skip too many --sine of pi over 2 plus 4 times pi over 2-- 1that's just 2 pi minus 2 sine of 2 times pi over 2 sine of 1pie, and then all of that minus all this evaluated at 0. 1That's actually pretty straightforward because 1sine of 0 is 0. 14 times 0 is 0, and sine of 2 times 0, that's also 0. 1So everything with the 0's work out nicely. 1And then what do we have here? 1Sine of pi over 2-- in my head, I think sine of 90 degrees; 1same thing --that is 1. 1And then sine of pi is 0, that's 180 degrees. 1So this whole thing cancels out. 1So we're left with 4 plus 2 pi. 1So just like that we were able to figure out the area of this 1first curvy wall here, and frankly, that's 1the hardest part. 1Now let's figure out the area of this curve. 1And actually you're going to find out that these other 1curves as they go along the axes are much, much, much 1easier, but we're going to have to find different 1parametrizations for this. 1So if we take this curve right here, let's do a 1parametrization for that. 1Actually, you know what? 1Let me continue this in the next video because I realize 1I've been running a little longer. 1I'll do the next two walls and then we'll sum them all up.",math_multivariable-calculus_integrating-multivariable-functions
" Let's do another states of matter phase change problem. And we'll deal with water again. But this one hopefully will stretch our neurons a little bit further. So let's say I have 500 grams of water. Of liquid water. At 60 degrees Celsius. Now my goal is to get it to zero degrees Celsius. And the way I'm going to do it is, I'm going to put ice into this 500 grams of water. And my ice machine at home makes ice that comes out of the machine at minus 10 degrees Celsius ice. And my question is, exactly how much ice do I need? So how much, or how many grams of ice? And I'm going to take the ice out of the freezer and just plop it into my liquid. How much do I need to bring this liquid, this 500 grams of liquid water, down to zero degrees? So the idea, if we just imagine a cup here. Let me draw a cup. This is a cup. I have some 60 degree water in there. I'm going to plunk a big chunk of ice in there. And what's going to happen is that heat from the water is going to go into the ice. So the ice is going to absorb heat from the water. So in order for water to go from 60 degrees to zero degrees, I have to extract heat out of it. And we're about to figure out just how much heat. And so we have to say, whatever was extracted out of the water, essentially has to be contained by the ice. And the ice can't get above zero degrees. Essentially, that amount of ice has to absorb all that heat to go from minus 10 to zero. And then also, that energy will be used to melt it a bit. But if we don't have enough ice, then the ice is going to go beyond that and then warm up even more. So let's see how we do this. So how much energy do we have to take out of the 500 grams of liquid water? Well, it's the same amount of energy that it would take to put into zero degrees liquid water and get it to 60 degrees. So we're talking about a 50 degree change. So the energy or the heat out of the water is going to be the specific heat of water, 4.178 joules per grams Kelvin. And I have to multiply that times the number of grams of water I have to cool down, I have to take the heat out of. And we know that's 500 grams. And then I multiply that times the temperature differential that we care about. And just a side note, I use this specific heat because we're dealing with liquid water. Liquid water going from 60 to zero. So the final thing, I have to multiply it by the change in temperature. The change in temperature is 60 degrees. Times 60 degrees. There's a little button on the side of my pen, when I press it by accident sometimes it does that weird thing. So let's see what this is. So this is 4.178 times 500 times change of 60 degrees. It could be a change of 60 degrees Kelvin or a change of 60 degrees Celsius. It doesn't matter. The actual difference is the same, whether we're doing Kelvin or Celsius. And it's 125,340 joules. So this is the amount of heat that you have to take out of 60 degree water in order to get it down to zero degrees. Or the amount of heat you have to add to zero degree water to get it to 60 degrees. So essentially, our ice has to absorb this much energy without going above zero degrees. So how much energy can the ice absorb? Well let's set a variable. The question is how much ice. So let's set our variable, maybe we'll call it I. Let's do x. x is always the unknown variable. So we're going to have x grams of ice. OK, and it starts at minus 10 degrees. So when this x grams of ice warms from minus 10 degrees to zero degrees Celsius, how much energy will it be absorbing? So to go from minus 10 degrees Celsius to zero degrees Celsius, the heat that's absorbed by the ice is equal to-- is equal to the specific heat of ice, ice water, 2.05 joules per gram Kelvin, times the amount of ice. That's what we're solving for. So times x. Times the change in temperature. So this is a 10 degree change in Celsius degrees, which is also a 10 degree change in Kelvin degrees. We can just do 10 degrees. I could write Kelvin here, just because at least when I wrote the specific heat units, I have a Kelvin in the denominator. It could have been a Celsius, but just to make them cancel out. This is, of course, x grams. So the grams cancel out. So that heat absorbed to go from minus 10 degree ice to zero degree ice is 2.05 times 10 is 20.5. So it's 20.5 times x joules. This is to go from minus 10 degrees to zero degrees. Now, once we're at zero degrees, the ice can even absorb more energy before increasing in temperature as it melts. Remember, when I drew that phase change diagram. The ice gains some energy and then it levels out as it melts. As the the bonds, the hydrogen bonds start sliding past each other, and the crystalline structure breaks down. So this is the amount of energy the ice can also absorb. Let me do it in a different color. Zero degree ice to zero-- I did it again-- to zero degree water. Well the heat absorbed now is going to be the heat of fusion of ice. Or the melting heat, either one. That's 333 joules per gram. It's equal to 333.55 joules per gram times the number of grams we have. Once again, that's x grams. They cancel out. So the ice will absorb 333.55 joules as it goes from zero degree ice to zero degree water. Or 333.55x joules. Let me put the x there, that's key. So the total amount of heat that the ice can absorb without going above zero degrees. Because once it's at zero degree water, as you put more heat into it, it's going to start getting warmer again. If the ice gets above zero degrees, there's no way it's going to bring the water down to zero degrees. The water can't get above zero degrees. So how much total heat can our ice absorb? So heat absorbed is equal to the heat it can absorb when it goes from minus 10 to zero degrees ice. And that's 20.5x. Where x is the number of grams of ice we have. Plus the amount of heat we can absorb as we go from zero degree ice to zero degree water. And that's 333.55x. And of course, all of this is joules. So this is the total amount of heat that the ice can absorb without going above zero degrees. Now, how much real energy does it have to absorb? Well it has to absorb all of this 125,340 joules of energy out of the water. Because that's the amount of energy we have to extract from the water to bring it down to zero degrees. So the amount of energy the ice absorbs has to be this 125,340. So that has to be equal to 125,340 joules. We can do a little bit of algebra here. Add these two things. 20.5x plus 333.55x is 354.05x. Is that right? Yeah, 330 plus 30 is 350. Then you have a 3 with a 0.5 there. 354.05x and that is equal to the amount of energy we take out of the water. You divide both sides. So x is equal to 125,340 divided by 354.05. I'll take out the calculator for this. The calculator tells me 125,340, the amount of energy that has to be absorbed by the ice, divided by 354.05 is equal to 354 grams. Roughly; there's a little bit extra. So actually, just to be careful maybe I'll take 355 1grams of ice. 1Because I definitely want my water to be chilled. 1So our answer is x is equal to 354.02 grams of ice. 1So this is interesting. 1I had 500 grams of liquid. 1And you know, intuitively I said, well if I have to bring 1that down to zero degrees, I'd have to have a ton of ice. 1But it turns out, I only need, what was the exact number? 1So the liquid is 500 grams. About, roughly half a pound, 1if you want to get a sense for how much 500 grams is. 1A kilogram is 2.2 pounds. 1So this ice is 354. 1So you actually have to have less ice than water. 1Which is interesting, because it seems like the ice isn't 1making that big of a temperature change. 1The ice is only going from minus 10 to zero degrees. 1While the water is going all the way from 60 degrees to 1zero degrees. 1So you're like, how does that work out? 1And the reason is because so much energy can be absorbed by 1the ice in the form of potential energy as it melts. 1So if you talk about all the energy that the ice is 1asborbing, most of it is due to the heat of 1fusion right there. 1You can actually have zero degree ice and it can still 1absorb this huge amount of energy just by melting it. 1Without even changing its temperature. 1Anyway, hopefully you found that reasonably useful.",science_chemistry_thermodynamics-chemistry
" Let's think about what it means to add numbers. So let's start with 1. 1 plus. 1 plus 1. What is this going to be equal to? One way to think about this is we have 1 thing, and that thing will be a purple circle. So let me put that here. So that's this 1 thing. I'm just going to represent it with a purple circle. And I'm going to add another 1 thing. And since this is in blue, I'll make that other circle, I'll make that in blue as well. So let me put that right over here. So 1 plus 1. 1 plus 1. How many total circles do I now have? Well, I now have 2 circles. I now have 2 circles. 1 plus 1 is equal to, is equal to 2. Okay, you're saying all right Sal, all right, that makes sense. Let's do this with larger numbers. So let's say we want to know what equals ... And I'll put a question mark over here. So, question mark. What equals ... So something is equal to, is equal to, let's say, 2, 2, 2 plus 3. Something is equal to 2 plus 3. What is this something going to be? I encourage you to pause the video and think about it on your own. Well, you could view this as, I have 2 objects and then we're going to add another 3 objects. How many total objects would I have? So you have your 2 objects, which I'll use purple circles again. So let me ... Let me, so, we have 1 and 2 purple circles. This is the 2 right over here. And then to that we're going to add 3 more. 3 more circles. I'll represent those in blue because we wrote the 3, here, in blue. So that is 1, 2, and 3. So how many total circles do we now have? Well, we could count them. We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. In fact, let me count that. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 circles. So 2 plus 3. 2 things plus another 3 things are 5 things. So our question mark, right over here, is equal to 5. So instead of writing the question mark right over here, let me clear that out. I could say 5 is equal to. I could write down that 5 is equal to 2 plus 3.",math_cc-kindergarten-math_cc-kindergarten-add-subtract
" -  So we have a trapezoid here on the coordinate plane and what we want to do is find the area of this trapezoid, just given this diagram. And, like always, pause this video and see if you can figure it out. Well, we know how to figure out the area of a trapezoid. We have videos where we derive this formula. But, the area of a trapezoid, just put simply, is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases, we could say base one plus base two times the height. And, so what are our bases here? What are, and what is going to be our height over here? Well, we could call base one, we could call that segment CL, so it would be the length of segment CL, right over here. I'll do that in magenta. That is going to be base one. Base two, base two, that could, we'll do that in a different color. Base two would be the length of segment OW, or b two would be the length of segment OW, right over there. And then, our height, our height h, well, that would just be an altitude and they did one in a dotted line, here. Notice it intersects the, base one, I guess you could say segment CL at a right angle, here. And so, this would be, this would be the height. So, if we know the lengths of each of these, if we know each of these values, which are the lengths of these segments, then we can evaluate the area of this actual trapezoid. And, once again, if this is completely unfamiliar to you or of you're curious, we have multiple videos talking about the proofs or how we came up with this formula. You an even break out, break down a trapezoid into two triangles and a rectangle, which is one way to think about it. Anyway, let's see how we could figure this out. So, the first one is, what is b one going to be? B one is the length of segment CL and you could say, ""We'll look, we know what these, ""the coordinates of these points are."" You could say, ""Let's use the distance formula,"" and you could say, ""Well, the distance formula is just ""an application of the Pythagorean Theorem."" So, this is going to be the square root of our change in x squared, so our change in x is going to be this, right over here. And, notice, we're going from x equals negative four to x equals eight, as w go from C to L. So, our change in x is equal to eight minus negative four which is equal to 12. And, our change in in y, our change in y, we are going from y equals negative one to y equals five. So, we could say our change in y equal to five minus negative one which, of course, is equal to six. And, you see that: one, two, three, four, five, six. And, the segment that we care about, its length that we care about, that's just the hypotenuse of this right triangle that has one side 12 and one side six. So, the length of that hypotenuse, from the Pythagorean Theorem, and, as I mentioned, the distance formula is just an application of the Pythagorean Theorem, this is going to be our change in x, squared, 12 squared, plus our change in y, squared, so plus six squared, and this is going to be equal to 144 plus 36. So, the square root of 144 plus 36 is one hundred, one hundred and 80 which is equal to, let's see, 180 is 36 times five. So, that is six square roots, six square roots of five. Oh, let me not skip some steps. So, this is the square root of 36 times five which is equal to, square root of 36 is 6, so six square roots of five. Now, let's figure out b two. So, b two, once again, change in x squared plus the square root of change in x squared plus change in y squared. Well, let's see, if we're going from, we could set up a right triangle, if you like, like this, to figure those things out. So, our change in x, we're going from x is at negative two, x is going from negative two to positive four. So, our change in x is six. Our change in y, we are going from, we are going from y equals, y equals five to y equals eight. So, our change in y is equal to three. So, just applying the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse, here, is going to be the square root of change in x squared, six squared, plus change in y squared, plus three squared which is going to be equal to, it's going to be equal to 36 plus nine, which is 45, so, square root of 45 which is equal to the square root of nine times five which is equal to three square roots of five. And so, we only have one left to figure out. We have to figure out h. We have to figure out the length of h. So, h is going to be equal to, and so, what is our, if we're going from W to N, our change in x is two. Change in x is equal to two. We're going from X equals four to x equals six. If you want to do that purely numerically, we would say, ""Okay, our endpoint, our x value is six. ""Our starting point, our x-value is four. ""Six minus four is two."" You see that visually, here. So, it's going to be the square root of two squared plus our, let me write that radical a little bit better. So, it's the square root of our change in x squared plus our change in y squared. Our change in y is negative four. Change in y is negative four but we're going to square it, so it's going to become a positive 16. So, this is going to be equal to the square root of four plus 16. Square root of 20, which is equal to the square root of four times five, which is equal to two times the square root of five. It's nice that the square root of five keeps popping up. And so, now we just substitute into our original expression. And so, our Area of our trapezoid is going to be one half times six square roots of five, six square roots of five, plus three square roots of five, plus three square roots of five, let me close that parentheses, times two square roots of five, times two square roots of five. And, let's see how we can simplify this. So, six square roots of five plus three square roots of five, that is nine square roots of five. Let's see, the one half times the two, those cancel out to just be one. And so, we're left with nine square roots of five times the square root of five. Well, the square root of five times the square root of five is just going to be five. So, this is equal to nine times five which is equal to 45 square units or units squared.",math_math1_analytic-geo
" Let's say I have the equation y is equal to x plus 3. And I want to graph all of the sets, all of the coordinates x comma y that satisfy this equation right there. And we've done this many times before. So we draw our axis, our axes. That's my y-axis. This is my x-axis. And this is already in mx plus b form, or slope-intercept form. The y-intercept here is y is equal to 3, and the slope here is 1. So this line is going to look like this. We intersect at 0 comma 3-- 1, 2, 3. At 0 comma 3. And we have a slope of 1, so every 1 we go to the right, we go up 1. So the line will look something like that. It's a good enough approximation. So the line will look like this. And remember, when I'm drawing a line, every point on this line is a solution to this equation. Or it represents a pair of x and y that satisfy this equation. So maybe when you take x is equal to 5, you go to the line, and you're going to see, gee, when x is equal to 5 on that line, y is equal to 8 is a solution. And it's going to sit on the line. So this represents the solution set to this equation, all of the coordinates that satisfy y is equal to x plus 3. Now let's say we have another equation. Let's say we have an equation y is equal to negative x plus 3. And we want to graph all of the x and y pairs that satisfy this equation. Well, we can do the same thing. This has a y-intercept also at 3, right there. But its slope is negative 1. So it's going to look something like this. Every time you move to the right 1, you're going to move down 1. Or if you move to the right a bunch, you're going to move down that same bunch. So that's what this equation will look like. Every point on this line represents a x and y pair that will satisfy this equation. Now, what if I were to ask you, is there an x and y pair that satisfies both of these equations? Is there a point or coordinate that satisfies both equations? Well, think about it. Everything that satisfies this first equation is on this green line right here, and everything that satisfies this purple equation is on the purple line right there. So what satisfies both? Well, if there's a point that's on both lines, or essentially, a point of intersection of the lines. So in this situation, this point is on both lines. And that's actually the y-intercept. So the point 0, 3 is on both of these lines. So that coordinate pair, or that x, y pair, must satisfy both equations. And you can try it out. When x is 0 here, 0 plus 3 is equal to 3. When x is 0 here, 0 plus 3 is equal to 3. It satisfies both of these equations. So what we just did, in a graphical way, is solve a system of equations. Let me write that down. And all that means is we have several equations. Each of them constrain our x's and y's. So in this case, the first one is y is equal to x plus 3, and then the second one is y is equal to negative x plus 3. This constrained it to a line in the xy plane, this constrained our solution set to another line in the xy plane. And if we want to know the x's and y's that satisfy both of these, it's going to be the intersection of those lines. So one way to solve these systems of equations is to graph both lines, both equations, and then look at their intersection. And that will be the solution to both of these equations. In the next few videos, we're going to see other ways to solve it, that are maybe more mathematical and less graphical. But I really want you to understand the graphical nature of solving systems of equations. Let's do another one. Let's say we have y is equal to 3x minus 6. That's one of our equations. And let's say the other equation is y is equal to negative x plus 6. And just like the last video, let's graph both of these. I'll try to do it as precisely as I can. There you go. Let me draw some. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. And then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. I should have just copied and pasted some graph paper here, but I think this'll do the job. So let's graph this purple equation here. Y-intercept is negative 6, so we have-- let me do another [? slash-- ?] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So that's y is equal to negative 6. And then the slope is 3. So every time you move 1, you go up 3. You moved to the right 1, your run is 1, your rise is 1, 2, 3. That's 3, right? 1, 2, 3. So the equation, the line will look like this. And it looks like I intersect at the point 2 comma 0, which is right. 3 times 2 is 6, minus 6 is 0. So our line will look something like that right there. That's that line there. What about this line? Our y-intercept is plus 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And our slope is negative 1. So every time we go 1 to the right, we go down 1. And so this will intersect at-- well, when y is equal to 0, x is equal to 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So right over there. So this line will look like that. The graph, I want to get it as exact as possible. And so we're going to ask ourselves the same question. What is an x, y pair that satisfies both of these equations? Well, you look at it here, it's going to be this point. This point lies on both lines. And let's see if we can figure out what that point is. Just eyeballing the graph here, it looks like we're at 1, 2, 3 comma 1, 2, 3. It looks like this is the same point right there, that this is the point 3 comma 3. I'm doing it just on inspecting my hand-drawn graphs, so maybe it's not the exact-- let's check this answer. Let's see if x is equal to 3, y equals 3 definitely satisfies both these equations. So if we check it into the first equation, you get 3 is equal to 3 times 3, minus 6. This is 9 minus 6, which is indeed 3. So 3 comma 3 satisfies the top equation. And let's see if it satisfies the bottom equation. You get 3 is equal to negative 3 plus 6, and negative 3 plus 6 is indeed 3. So even with our hand-drawn graph, we were able to inspect it and see that, yes, we were able to come up with the point 3 comma 3, and that does satisfy both of these equations. So we were able to solve this system of equations. When we say system of equations, we just mean many equations that have many unknowns. They don't have to be, but they tend to have more than one unknown. And you use each equation as a constraint on your variables, and you try to find the intersection of the equations to find a solution to all of them. In the next few videos, we'll see more algebraic ways of solving these than drawing their two graphs and trying to find their intersection points.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-systems-topic
" - Let's compare the number 0.7 to the number 0.09. And there's a bunch of ways to do this, but the way that I'm going to tackle it is I'm gonna start looking at each of the digits, starting with the leftmost digit. And so we can start right over here in the ones place. You always want to compare ones place to ones place, so for example if we compare these two numbers, they both have zero ones. So the ones place doesn't tell us much. So now let's go one place value to the right. Let's go to the tenths place. This number has seven tenths, while this number has zero tenths. That by itself tells us that this is the larger number. We would put an inequality symbol right over here. We wanna open it up to the larger number, where it points to the smaller number. So this says 0.7 is greater than 0.09. Now you might be tempted to say oh wait, wait. Look, but if we went one more digit to the right you have nine hundredths here, and you have no hundredths over here. We could write a zero over here, and you'd say well look, you have no hundredths over here. But the nine hundredths don't matter. Remember, even if you had 10 hundredths, that's the same thing as one tenth. So it doesn't matter that nine is somehow greater than seven. What matters is it's in a place to the right. Even if you increased by another hundredth here you'd only get to one tenth. This thing over here has seven tenths. Let's do another one of these. Let's say we wanted to compare, let's say we wanted to compare 0.29, let's say I wanna compare that to 0.31. Now this one you might say is a little bit more straightforward, depending on how you think about it. If you say hey, this is 29 hundredths, this is 31 hundredths, we have more hundredths on the right-hand side. So let me open my inequality to the larger value and I would say 0.29, or 29 hundredths is less than 31 hundredths. Another way you could have done this is you could have looked in the ones place, say okay, they both have zero ones, but then you look in the tenths place, say this only has two tenths, while this has three tenths. I shouldn't have to keep looking at the digits to the right of that. I can just compare this two tenths to the three tenths. Three tenths is larger, and so I would say that 29 hundredths is less than 31 hundredths. Let's do one more, just for fun. Let's compare, let's compare 0.6 to, I'll do them in the same color. 0.06. Which of these is the larger number? Well we do the same thing that we've been doing. You can first go to the ones place. Say okay, this has no ones, this has no ones. Okay that doesn't tell us much. Then the tenths place. This has six tenths, this has zero tenths. So this number is going to be larger. It has more tenths. It doesn't matter who has more hundredths. Hundredths are much smaller than tenths. They're a tenth of the size of a tenth. So this has six tenths, this has zero tenths. So this number is larger. 0.6 is greater than 0.06. It's actually ten times greater but we can talk about that in other videos.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_imp-decimals
" -  When we first learned to multiply and divide positive and negative numbers, we saw, well look, if you have a positive number times a positive number. I'm just writing ""pos"" short for positive. Well that, of course, is going to be equal to a positive number that you saw that even before you learned about negative numbers. There's also true if you had the same sign, a negative times a negative, that that was also going to be equal to a positive number. And that the way that you get a negative number, is if you multiply or divide something of different signs. So if you have a positive times a negative that would give you a negative number. Or if you had a negative, negative times a positive, that also would give you a negative number. And here I wrote it for multiplication, but it also applies to division. A negative divided by a negative is positive. A negative divided by a positive would be negative. Now all of these, we thought about if we're only multiplying or dividing two things. But I was just thinking about what happens if we multiply or divide three things, or four things, or five things, or n things together, what we might expect? So let's say that we were to multiply a times, and now I'm going to write the dot for times. A times b times c, a times b times c. Now if I told you that these were all positive numbers, then you say, ""OK a times b times c is going ""to be positive."" ""A times b would be positive, and that times c is positive."" Now what would happen if I were to tell you that they were all negative numbers. What if a, b, and c were all negative? Well if there were all negative, let me write it that way. Let me actually write, let me write, a, b, and c, a, b, and c, they're all going to be negative. So if that's the case, what is this product going to be equal to? Well you're going to have a negative here, times a negative. So a negative times a negative, a times b, if you do that first, and we can when we multiply these numbers. That's going to give you a positive. So a times b is going to give you a positive. But then you're going to multiply that times c. You're going to multiply that times c, which is a negative. So you're going to have a positive times a negative, which is going to be a negative. So this one, if a, b, and c are all less than zero, then the product, a, b, c is going to be less than zero as well. This whole thing is going to be negative. Now, if I did something else. If I said, ""There's other ways ""that I can make the product negative."" If a is, let's say that a, actually let me just write it this way. Let's say that a is positive, b is negative. B is negative, and c is positive. And c is positive. Well here, positive times a negative, if you do this first. Positive times a negative is going to give you a negative. And then a negative times a positive, different signs, is going to give you a negative. So this whole thing, this whole thing is going to be a negative. But let's keep on doing, we said, look if all of them are negative, then this thing would be negative, but that's because I had three numbers here. What if I had four numbers here? What if I had times, What if I had times d here? And if I told you all of these numbers were negative? Let's think about it, if negative, negative, negative, negative. And I can do the multiplication in any order, but I'll just go left to right. A times b, negative times a negative. That would yield a positive. Now if you multiply that product times c, positive times a negative, positive times a negative, positive times a negative that would give you a negative. And then you multiply this negative times this negative, so this whole product, a, b, c, is going to be negative. But then we multiply it times a negative. Well a negative times a negative is going to be a positive. So this whole thing is going to be a positive. And so you're probably seeing a pattern here. If you're multiplying a bunch of numbers, if you're multiplying a bunch of numbers, and if you have an odd number of negatives, odd number of negatives being multiplied, and or divided. I just did multiplication here, but this would have also been true if these were all division symbols. If these were all division symbols, we would've been able to say the exact same thing. If you have an odd number of negative numbers in your product or in your quotient, well then you're going to have a negative, you're going to have a negative value for the entire expression. If you have an even, if you have an even number of negative, well then the whole thing is going to be, the whole thing is going to be positive. And so you can view these as generalizations of what we just saw here. Positive times a positive. You have zero negative. Zero is actually an even number, so this would be positive. Negative times a negative. Well that's an even number of negatives. You have two negatives, so that's this case again. That's this case again, so you're going to be positive. Either of these cases, you have one negative. You have one negative in either of these cases, so it's going to be this case, odd number of negatives. So that's going to be a negative. And so, we can use this knowledge to start dealing with negative numbers and exponents. So if I were to say, I would have a to the, let me throw out a wild number here, A to the 101st power, And we know that a is less than zero. What is this going to be? Well this is taking 101 A's and multiplying them together. You have an odd number, an odd number of negatives being multiplied together? Well this whole then is going, this whole thing is going to be less than zero. If we knew what a was, we could calculate it somehow, but we know that this thing is going to be negative. Let's do something, so, and we could do it other ways. We could say something like this. Actually, let me try another one. What if I tell you that a is less than zero, and b is also less than zero, and if I had a to the 101 power, divided by b to the seventh power, what would this expression be? Would it be positive or negative? Or zero, maybe? Well you see here, a to the 101st power. You have an odd number of, you have an odd number of negative numbers being multiplied. So this whole thing is going to be negative. And the same thing applies here. You have a negative number to an odd power. You have an odd number of this negative number being multiplied together. So that's going to be negative, but then you have a negative divided by a negative. A negative divided by a negative is going to be a positive. So this thing, right here, is going to be positive. So this is just the beginning, and in the next few videos we'll actually do a bunch of examples that really test our understanding of this.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-numbers-operations
" Mark pedals his bike 70 times in a minute. Which of these are reasonable estimates about Mark's peddling? Mark all that applies. So let's just think about this a little bit. 70 times in a minute. So there are 60 seconds in a minute. So if he's doing 70 times in a minute, if he was doing 60 times in a minute, then he would be peddling once per second. Since he's doing 70 times in a minute, he's doing a little bit more than once per second. So maybe that'll help us right over here. So here it says Mark peddles his bike what? 4,000 times every second. Well, that's nuts. If he peddled his bike 4,000 times every second, you'd have a way huger number right over here. You'd have 4,000 times per second times 60 seconds per minute. You would have a huge number right over here. If it's 70 times in a minute, we just reasoned that he peddles a little over one time in a second. So this is definitely not right. Mark pedals his bike about once every hour. Well, an hour is 60 minutes. So if he does 70 times in a minute, he's going to do 60 times 70 in an hour. So this is also crazy, that he only does once in an hour. This is unbelievably slow. Mark pedals his bike about once every second. Well, we've already reasoned that there's 60 seconds in a minute, and he does 70 times in a minute. So he does a little over-- if you divide 70 by 60, so you could divide 70 by 60, and you're going to get a number that's a little bit over 1 time per second. So this is right. We're estimating. We don't get exact numbers. It's about once every second. So that seems legitimate. Mark pedals his bike about 4,000 times every hour. So let's think about that. If he pedals 70 times in a minute, and then there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is going to be equal to 70 times 60. Well, we can multiply the 7 times the 6, and we get 7 times 6 is 42. And we have two zeroes here. So we have exactly 4,200 times every hour. So as an estimate, this is pretty close. So I would go with that as well.",math_arithmetic-home_multiply-divide
" -  Let's say that y is equal to seven to the x squared minus x power. What is the derivative of y, derivative of y, with respect to x? And like always, pause this video and see if you can figure it out. Well, based on how this has been color-coded ahead of time, you might immediately recognize that this is a composite function, or it could be viewed as a composite function. If you had a v of x, which if you had a function v of x, which is equal to seven to the xth power, and you had another function u of x, u of x which is equal to x squared minus x, then what we have right over here, y, y is equal to seven to something, so it's equal to v of, and it's not just v of x, it's v of u of x, instead of an x here you have the whole function u of x, x squared minus x. So, it's v of u of x and the chain rule tells us that the derivative of y with respect to x, and you'll see different notations here, sometimes you'll see it written as the derivative of v with respect to u, so v prime of u of x times the derivative of u with respect to x, so that's one way you could do it, or you could say that this is equal to, this is equal to the derivative, the derivative of v with respect to x, sorry, derivative of v with respect to u, d v d u times the derivative of u with respect to x, derivative of u with respect to x, and so either way we can apply that right over here. So, what's the derivative of v with respect to u? What is v prime of u of x? Well, we know, we know, let me actually write it right over here, if v of x is equal to seven to the x power v prime of x would be equal to, and we've proved this in other videos where we take derivatives exponentials of bases other than e, this going to be the natural log of seven times seven to the x power. So, if we are taking v prime of u of x, then notice instead of an x everywhere, we're going to have a u of x everywhere. So, this right over here, this is going to be natural log of seven times seven to the, instead of saying seven to the x power, remember we're taking v prime of u of x, so it's going to be seven to the x squared minus x power, x squared, x squared minus x power, and then we want to multiply that times the derivative of u with respect to x. So, u prime of x, well, that's going to be two x to the first which is just two x minus one, so we're going to multiply this times two x, two x minus one, so there you have it, that is the derivative of y with respect to x. You could, we could try to simplify this or I guess re-express it in different ways, but the main thing to realize is, look, we're just gonna take the derivative of the seven to the this to the u of x power with respect to u of x. So, we treat the u of x the way that we would've treated an x right over here, so it's gonna be natural log of seven times seven to the u of x power, we take that and multiply that times u prime of x, and once again this is just an application of the chain rule.",math_calculus-1_cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics
" We're asked to factor 40c to the third power minus 5d to the third power. So the first thing that might jump out at you is that 5 is a factor of both of these terms. I could rewrite this as 5 times 8c to the third power minus 5 times d to the third power. And so you could actually factor out a 5 here, so factor out a 5. And so if you factor out a 5, you get 5 times 8c to the third power minus d to the third power. So as you see, factoring, it really is just undistributing the 5, reversing the distributive property. And when you write it like this, it might jump out at you that 8 is a perfect cube. It's 2 to the third power. c to the third power is obviously c to the third power. And then you have d to the third power. So this right here is a difference of cubes. And actually, let me write that explicitly because 8 is the same thing as 2 to the third power. So you can write this as-- let me write the 5 out front-- 5 times-- this term right over here can be rewritten as 2c to the third power because it's 2 to the third power times c to the third power-- 8c to the third power-- And then, minus d to the third power. And so this gives us, right over here, a difference of cubes. And you can actually factor a difference of cubes. And you may or may not know the pattern. So if I have a to the third minus b to the third, this can be factored as a minus b times a squared plus ab plus b squared. And if you don't believe me, I encourage you to multiply this out, and you will get a to the third minus b to the third. You get a bunch of terms that cancel out, so you're only left with two terms. And even though it's not applicable here, it's also good to know that the sum of cubes is also factorable. It's factorable as a plus b times a squared minus ab plus b squared. So once again, I won't go through the time of multiplying this out, but I encourage you to do so. It just takes a little bit of polynomial multiplication. And you'll be able to prove to yourself that this is indeed the case. Now, assuming that this is the case, we can just do a little bit of pattern matching. Because in this case, our a is 2c, and our b is d. So let me write this. a is equal to 2c, and our b is equal to d. We have minus b to the third and minus d to the third, so b and d must be the same thing. So this part inside must factor out to-- let me write my 5, open parentheses. Let me give myself some space. So it's going to factor out into a minus b. So a is 2c minus b, which is d. So it factors out as the difference of the two things that I'm taking the cube of. 2c minus d times-- and now, I have a squared is 2c squared. 2c squared is the same thing as 4c squared. Let me make that. a squared is equal to 2c-- the whole thing squared, which is equal to 4c squared. So it's 4c squared plus a times b. So that's going to be 2c times d, so plus 2c times d. And then finally plus b squared, and in our case, b is d. So you get plus d squared. And you're done. We have factored it out. And actually, you could get rid of one set of parentheses. This can be factored as 5 times 2c minus d times 4c squared plus 2cd plus d squared. And we are done.",math_algebra-home_alg-polynomials
" Let's say I go to a store and I have $50 in my pocket. $50 in my wallet. And at the store that day they say it is a 25% off marked price sale. So 25% off marked price means that if the marked price is $100 the price I'm going to pay is going to be 25% less than $100. So my question to you is if I have $50, what is the highest marked price I can afford? Because I need to know that before I go finding something that I might like. So let's do a little bit of algebra. So let x be the highest marked price that I can afford. So if the sale is 25% off of x, we could say that the new price, the sale price will be x minus 25% of x is equal to the sale price. And I'm assuming that I'm in a state without sales tax. Whatever the sale price is, is what I have to pay in cash. So x minus 25% x is equal to the sale price. The discount is going to be 25% of x. But we know that this is the same thing as x minus 0.25x. And we know that that's the same thing as-- well, because we know this is 1x, x is the same thing is 1x. 1x minus 0.25x. Well, that means that 0.75x is equal to the sale price, right? All I did is I rewrote x minus 25% of x as 1x minus 0.25x. And that's the same thing as 0.75x. Because 1 minus 0.25 is 0.75. So 0.75x is going to be the sale price. Well, what's the sale price that I can afford? Well, the sale price I can afford is $50. So 0.75x is going to equal $50. If x is any larger number than the number I'm solving for, then the sale price is going to be more than $50 and I won't be able to afford it. So that's how we set the-- the highest I can pay is $50 and that's the sale price. So going back to how we did these problems before. We just divide both sides by 0.75. And we say that the highest marked price that I can afford is $50 divided by 0.75. And let's figure out what that is. 0.75 goes into 50-- let's add some 0's in the back. If I take this decimal 2 to the right. Take this decimal, move it 2 to the right, goes right there. So 0.75 goes into 50 the same number of times that 75 goes into 5,000. So let's do this. 75 goes into 50 zero times. 75 goes into 500-- so let me think about that. I think it goes into it six times. Because seven times is going to be too much. So it goes into it six times. 6 times 5 is 30. 6 times 7 is 42. Plus 3 is 45. So the remainder is 50. I see a pattern. Bring down the 0. Well, same thing again. 75 goes into 500 six times. 6 times 75 is going to be 450 again. We're going to keep having that same pattern over and over and over again. It's actually 66.666-- I hope you don't think I'm an evil person because of this number that happened to show up. But anyway, so the highest sale price that I can afford or the highest marked price I can afford is $66 dollars. And if I were to around up, and $0.67 if I were to round to the nearest penny. If I were to write this kind of as a repeating decimal, I could write this as 66.66 repeating. Or I also know that 0.6666 going on forever is the same thing as 2/3. So it's 66 and 2/3. But since we're working with money and we're working with dollars, we should just round to the nearest penny. So the highest marked price that I can afford is $66.67. So if I go and I see a nice pair of shoes for $55, I can afford it. If I see a nice tie for $70, I can't afford it with the $50 in my pocket. So hopefully not only will this teach you a little bit of math, but it'll help you do a little bit of shopping. So let me ask you another problem, a very interesting problem. Let's say I start with an arbitrary-- let's put a fixed number on it. Let's say I start with $100. And after one year it grows by 25%. And then the next year, let's call that year two, it shrinks by 25%. So this could have happened in the stock market. The first year I have a good year, my portfolio grows by 25%. The second year I have a bad year and my portfolio shrinks by 25%. So my question is how much money do I have at the end of the two years? Well a lot of people might say, oh, this is easy, Sal. If I grow by 25% and then I shrink by 25% I'll end up with the same amount of money. But I'll show you it's actually not that simple because the 25% in either case or in both cases is actually a different amount of money. So let's figure this out. If I start with $100 and I grow it by 25%-- 25% of $100 is $25. So I grew it by $25. So I go to $125. So after one year of growing by 25% I end up with $125. And now this $125 is going to shrink by 25$. So if something shrinks by 25%, that means it's just going to be 0.75 or 75% of what it was before, right? 1 minus 25%. 0.75 times $125. So let's work that out here. $125 times 0.75. And just in case you're confused, I don't want to repeat it too much, but if something shrinks by 25% it is now 75% of its original value. So if $125 shrinks by 25% it's now 75% of $125 or 0.75. Let's do the math. 5 times 5 is 25. 2 times 5 is 10 plus 2 is 12. 1 times 5-- 7. 7 times 5 is 35. 7 times 2 is 14. Plus 3 is 17. Sorry. 7 times 1 is 7. Plus 1 is 8. So it's 5, 7, and then this is 7 actually. 14. 9. 94.75, right? Two decimal points. 94.75. So it's interesting. If I start with $100 and it grows by 25%, and then it shrinks by 25% I end up with less than I started with. And I want you to think about why that happens. Because 25% on $100 is the amount that I'm gaining. That's a smaller number than the amount that I'm losing. I'm losing 25% on $125. That's pretty interesting, don't you think? That's actually very interesting when a lot of people compare-- well, actually I won't go into stock returns and things. But I think that should be a pretty interesting thing. You should try that out with other examples. Another interesting thing is for any percentage gain, you should think about how much you would have to lose-- what percentage you would have to lose to end up where you started. That's another interesting project. Maybe I'll do that in a future presentation. Anyway, I think you're now ready to do some of those percent madness problems. Hope you have fun.

" -  So, we've got a Riemann sum. We're gonna take the limit as N approaches infinity and the goal of this video is to see if we can rewrite this as a definite integral. I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can work through it on your own. So, let's remind ourselves how a definite integral can relate to a Riemann sum. So, if I have the definite integral from A to B of F of X, F of X, DX, we have seen in other videos this is going to be the limit as N approaches infinity of the sum, capital sigma, going from I equals one to N and so, essentially we're gonna sum the areas of a bunch of rectangles where the width of each of those rectangles we can write as a delta X, so your width is going to be delta X of each of those rectangles and then your height is going to be the value of the function evaluated some place in that delta X. If we're doing a right Riemann sum we would do the right end of that rectangle or of that sub interval and so, we would start at our lower bound A and we would add as many delta Xs as our index specifies. So, if I is equal to one, we add one delta X, so we would be at the right of the first rectangle. If I is equal two, we add two delta Xs. So, this is going to be delta X times our index. So, this is the general form that we have seen before and so, one possibility, you could even do a little bit of pattern matching right here, our function looks like the natural log function, so that looks like our func F of X, it's the natural log function, so I could write that, so F of X looks like the natural log of X. What else do we see? Well, A, that looks like two. A is equal to two. What would our delta X be? Well, you can see this right over here, this thing that we're multiplying that just is divided by N and it's not multiplying by an I, this looks like our delta X and this right over here looks like delta X times I. So, it looks like our delta X is equal to five over N. So, what can we tell so far? Well, we could say that, okay, this thing up here, up the original thing is going to be equal to the definite integral, we know our lower bound is going from two to we haven't figured out our upper bound yet, we haven't figured out our B yet but our function is the natural log of X and then I will just write a DX here. So, in order to complete writing this definite integral I need to be able to write the upper bound and the way to figure out the upper bound is by looking at our delta X because the way that we would figure out a delta X for this Riemann sum here, we would say that delta X is equal to the difference between our bounds divided by how many sections we want to divide it in, divided by N. So, it's equals to B minus A, B minus A over N, over N and so, you can pattern match here. If this is delta X is equal to B minus A over N. Let me write this down. So, this is going to be equal to B, B minus our A which is two, all of that over N, so B minus two is equal to five which would make B equal to seven. B is equal to seven. So, there you have it. We have our original limit, our Riemann limit or our limit of our Riemann sum being rewritten as a definite integral. And once again, I want to emphasize why this makes sense. If we wanted to draw this it would look something like this, I'm gonna try to hand draw the natural log function, it looks something like this and this right over here would be one and so, let's say this is two and so going from two to seven, this isn't exactly right and so, our definite integral is concerned with the area under the curve from two until seven and so, this Riemann sum you can view as an approximation when N isn't approaching infinity but what you're saying is look, when I is equal to one, your first one is going to be of width five over N, so this is essentially saying our difference between two and seven, we're taking that distance five, dividing it into N rectangles, and so, this first one is going to have a width of five over N and then what's the height gonna be? Well, it's a right Riemann sum, so we're using the value of the function right over there, write it two plus five over N. So, this value right over here. This is the natural log, the natural log of two plus five over N, and since this is the first rectangle times one, times one. Now we could keep going. This one right over here the width is the same, five over N but what's the height? Well, the height here, this height right over here is going to be the natural log of two plus five over N times two, times two. This is for I is equal to two. This is I is equal to one. And so, hopefully you are seeing that this makes sense. The area of this first rectangle is going to be natural log of two plus five over N times one times five over N and the second one over here, natural log of two plus five over N times two times five over N and so, this is calculating the sum of the areas of these rectangles but then it's taking the limit as N approaches infinity so we get better and better approximations going all the way to the exact area.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-accumulation-riemann-sums
" So, once again let's think of yourself as some type of ancient philosopher/mathematician, who is trying to extend mathematics as much as possible and try to make sure that you're not being lazy and leaving things undefined, when you might be able to define them. Whenever you start extending mathematics, especially in the realm of multiplication and division, there are few things that you hold dear to. You feel that if you define some type of division operation, that needs to be undone by multiplication; this is close to your heart. So you assume... You want to assume... You would like to assume that any type of division operation, if you start with some number and if you divide with a number over which... - division by that number is defined - so when I divide by some number and then multiply by that same number that this should get me this original number right over here, this should give me x right over here. And this happens when we just multiply and divide with regular numbers. If I get 3 divided by 2 times 2, that's gonna get me 3. If I say 10 divided by 5 times 5, that's going to get me 10. The other things that I want to assume... - and this is very close to my heart - I feel that any type of definitions I make have to be constant with the idea x*0 has to be 0 or any x. So these are close to my heart. I wanna extend mathematics. These two things are things that cannot be contradicted, cannot be untrue. Now, that out of the way. You wanna start exploring the divide-by-0 question. So the first thing that you say: ""Well, let me just try to define it."" So let's start, let's assume that I have, so this is... So let's make a further assumption... that x is some non-zero number. Let's just say, well,maybe the best way of finding out what x divided by 0 should be, how I should divide it, let's just assume there is define, and then come up with any results that there might be, there might be a resolve for. So let's say that x divided by 0 is equal to k. Well, if this is true and if we are defining what it means to divide by zero, then we are assuming that if we multiply by zero, we'll get our original number right over here. This is something that we are not willing to contradict. So let's see what happens: x divided by 0 is equal to k. On the left hand side we have a divide by zero and than multiplied by zero. Well then if two things are equal, if I do something to one thing inorder for them to stay equal, I have to do it to the other thing. This has to be equal to that. I have to multiply the left hand AND the right hand side by zero. Well, then by this assumption that I am never willing to give up, this left hand side right over here, must be equal to x. And by this assumption right over here, that I am not willing to give up, This right hand side right over here must be equal to 0. But I just hit a contradiction! I assume that x does not equal to 0, and now I am being forced to say that x=0. And I am not willing to give up the idea, I am not willing to give up either of these ideas. I am defining what it means to divide by zero. Or if I am defining what it means to divide by anything... ...that if I then multiply by that something, that I should get my original number. And I am not willing to give up the idea that anything times 0 is 0. So all of these things... The only thing that I can give up is this right over here. And I'll say, well, I guess k will have to stay undefined. This whole contradiction happened because I attempted to define what x/0 is. Now that out of the way... OK... This was a situation when x does not equal zero. But what about when x DOES equal zero. So let's think about that a little bit. And once again, I will try to define it. So I will assume... that 0 divided by 0 is equal to some number. Well once again, so let's say it is equal to k again. And so, once again... we are trying to do the same logic, so we'll write 0/0 is equal to k. Actually, let me colourcode these zeros. This will be a magenta zero and this is a blue zero right over here. And once again, I am not willing to give up the idea that if I start with a number x, I divide it by something over which division is defined, and then I multiply by that something, I should get my original x again. I can't give this up. Otherwise it doesn't seem like a good definition for the division. So what I am gonna do - I am gonna multiply the left-hand side times 0 and by this property that I am not willing to give up, the left-hand side should simplify to this magenta zero. It should simplify to this over here. But once again, anything I do to once side of the equation, inorder for the equation to hold true, I need to the other side of the equation. And these two were equal beforehand. Any operation I do to this inorder for it to still be equal , I need to do to that. So let me multiply the right-hand side by zero. So the left I get 0, I just get this magenta 0, and on the right I could just write the zero here, but I won't simplify it. I get k times 0. Well, this I see right over here... This actually is not a contradiction. This actually is true for any k, This is one of the core assumptions that I've made in my mathematics that I am not willing to give up. So this is true True for any k. It's not a contradiction. But the problem here is I wanna come up with the k, I'd like a resolve for a k. It would not be nice if this turned out to be 0. if this turned out to be one, or if this turned out to be negative one But now I see, given the assumptions right here this could be ANY... this could be absolutely any k I cannot determine what k this should be This could be a hundred thousand, this could be 75, it could be anything true for any k I cannot determine what k this should be and that's why when you get a little bit more nuance in early math people will say, well 0 divided by 0, well we don't know what that's gonna be there's no consistent answer there so we're just going to call it undefined there's no good answer that seems better than any other answer but now we see a little bit nuance here one divided by zero... you just couldn't define it it led to direct contradictions zero divided by zero... it could be anything you can't determine it and so that's why, when you do higher level math and you'll often hear this when you take a calculus course we see that zero divided by zero is indeterminate",math_math1_algebra-foundation
" -  Alkanes are very unreactive, but they do undergo combustion reactions. So if you take methane and react it with oxygen, you'll get carbon dioxide and water as the products. And for all hydrocarbons, you're gonna get CO2 and H2O as the products of a combustion reaction. Delta H zero for this reaction is negative 890 kiloJoules per one mole of methane which means one mole of methane, if you combust one mole of methane, you're gonna get 890 kiloJoules of heat. And so this is an exothermic reaction, heat is given off. So the heat of combustion is the heat that's released on the complete combustion of one mole of a substance. In this case we're talking about methane. Let's talk about hexane next. Let me draw out the structure for hexane. So we have six carbons and notice we have two CH3 groups, so here's a CH3 and here's a CH3, so CH3 and CH3. And then we have four CH2 groups. So here's one, two, three, and four. So that's why we have a four right here. So there are four CH2 groups in hexane, and here we have the heat of combustion. And now we're gonna talk about the heat of combustion as the negative change in the enthalpy. So negative delta H zero in terms of kiloJoules per mole. That gives us a positive value here, so for hexane it's 4,163 kiloJoules for every one mole of hexane that we combust. Notice what happens as we move on to heptane here. We're increasing in one CH2 group. We're going from four CH2 groups to five CH2 groups. So now we're at five CH2 groups. We get an increase in the heat of combustion, so more heat is released. And that makes sense, if you increase the number of carbons, you're gonna increase in the heat of combustion. So if you increase by one CH2 group, how much do we increase in terms of the heat of combustion? Well, if you take 4,163 and subtract that from 4,817 that's a difference of 654 kiloJoules. The pattern continues when we move on to octane. So octane, now we have 6 CH2 groups. So we've added one more. We've increased our heat of combustion to 5,471 kiloJoules per one mole. And that is also an increase of 654 kiloJoules. So for noe, with one more CH2, we could predict, we could estimate the heat of combusion. And we could just add 654 to 5,471. So we can go ahead and set that up over here. So we have 5,471. We're adding 654 to that. So that would give us a five here, and then seven and five is 12, so we carry the one, and that gives us 11, so we get 6,125. So if I right that in here, 6,125 kiloJoules per mole is a pretty good estimation for the heat of combustion of noe. Heats of combustion are really useful when you're trying to compare the stability of isomers. For example, here we have three isomers: octane, 2-methylheptane, and 2,2-dimethylhexane. So all these molecules have the molecular formula C8H18. So if we write out the combustion reactions, so we have plus O2, we know the products are CO2 and H2O. So we have CO2 plus H2O. Let's go ahead and balance this. We have eight carbons on the left side, so we need an eight over here on the right, we'll put that in front of the CO2. And now let's look at hydrogens. There's 18 on the left, and so we need 18 on the right. And we can do that by putting a nine here, cause nine and two give us 18 hydrogens. Now let's see how many oxygens are on the right side. Well we have eight and 2 give us 16 oxygens here, and then nine gives us nine for the water. So that's a total of 25 oxygens on the right side. So we need 25 oxygens on the left side. Now if we pretend like this two isn't here for a second, we could write a 25 right here, but there is a two, so we need to divide by two. And if we're talking about one mole of C8H18, we're gonna leave this as a fraction, so 25 over two is the amount of oxygen that's necessary to completely react with one mole of C8H18. So now we have our balanced equation for our combustion reaction, and if we compare these three isomers, octane, 2-methylheptane, and 2,2-dimethylhexane in terms of their heats of combustion, we can figure out which one is the most stable isomer. Here we have an energy diagram for our three isomers. So on the left here, we'll put increasing energy this way. All three of our isomers would produce the same products if you combust one mole of them. Each one would give us eight CO2 and nine H2O. So there's an energy level associated with our products. And we'll say this is the energy level associated with our products. It's the same for all three of our isomers. Next we look up the heat of combustion data for the isomers, and this is determined experimentally. For example, octane has a heat of combustion of about 5,471 kiloJoules per mole, so that's how much heat is released, 5,471 kiloJoules per mole. And if we know the energy level of the products, and we know how much energy was released, we can find the energy level of our reactants. So there is the energy level for octane. Next let's think about 2-methylheptane. So again, the energy level of the products is here, and if we look up the heat of combustion for 2-methylheptane we'll find a value somewhere around 5,466. So that's how much energy is released when you combust one mole of 2-methylheptane, 5,466 kiloJoules per mole. Since the energy level of the products is the same as the one before, but we have a smaller heat of combustion this time, that must mean the energy level for 2-methylheptane is lower than the energy level for octane. And finally, we move on to 2,2-dimethylexane. The energy level of the products is the same as before. The heat of combustion is 5,458, so somewhere around 5,458 kiloJoules per mole is released, right? That's how much energy, or heat, is released when you combust one mole of 2,2-dimethylhexane. And since we have a smaller value for the heat of combustion, that must mean the energy is lower for 2,2-dimethylhexane. Now we can finally compare the stabilities of our isomers. The higher the energy, the less stable the compound. So octane has the highest energy level, has the highest heat of combustion. So this is the least stable out of these three, this is the least stable. The lower the energy for our starting compound, the more stable it is. So that must meant that 2,2-dimethylhexane is the most stable isomer out of these three. So now we can think about trends. As we go from octane to 2-methylheptane to 2,2-dimethylhexane we're increasing in branching. So we're increasing in the amount of branching that we have. What happened to the heats of combustion? Alright, if we define heat of combustion as the negative of the change in the enthalpy, the heats of combustion decrease. We went from 5,471 to 5,466 to 5,458. So there was a decrease in the heat of combustion. And what about stability? We got more stable as we branched more. So increased branching in general means increased stability. So it's important to be able to analyze heat of combustion data. Just remember the lower the energy, the more stable the compound. So the compound that had the highest heat of combustion was the least stable. And the compound with the lowest heat of combustion was the most stable. So branched alkanes are lower in energy, or more stable, than straight chain alkanes.",science_organic-chemistry_bond-line-structures-alkanes-cycloalkanes
" -  So we've already spent some time introducing ourselves to the idea of adding or subtracting positive and negative numbers. What I now what do in this video is do a bunch of examples using the adding negative numbers on the number line exercise on Khan Academy, so that we can think about different ways to model, or think about, or visualize adding and subtracting positive and negative numbers. So this question asks us, ""Which number line model represents ""the expression negative two ""plus negative seven?"" And a number line model seems like this really fancy thing, but they're just saying, which of these diagrams, which of these drawings are a way to think about what negative two plus negative seven is. So let's think about it. I want to start at negative two and then to that I want to add negative seven. So let's see what's going on here. This number line model I guess we could call it, it's saying this is positive two right over here. It's to the right of zero. Then it subtracts seven. This is the model that would be for positive two plus negative seven, or two, or positive two minus seven. But that's not what we have over here, we have negative two minus seven. This one right over here, let's see, this first... I guess you could say this thing, this arrow, it's going one, two, three, four, five to the left of zero. So starting at negative five, and then it goes another one, two, three, four to the left of that. So you could view this as negative five minus four. Or you could view this as negative five plus negative four, but that's not what we have up here. And then this last one, hopefully this is the answer, otherwise there would be a mistake in the exercise. Let's see, we have this first arrow that takes us two steps to the left of zero. So, one, two. So this is negative two, and then we take another seven steps to the left of that. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So you can think of this arrow as representing negative two, and then we're going to that, so we're starting from this tip of this arrow. We're going to add a negative seven which makes us move seven to the left again to get to negative nine. So that's definitely the model that represents that expression. Let's keep going. All right. Which number line model represents the expression six plus negative two. So here, they've taken our number lines but they've made them go up and down, they've made them vertical. So we wanna really think about it. I want to start at six and I want to add negative two. So on a vertical number line like this, it seems like we're increasing as we go up. I want to start at six above zero. So, I want to start at six above zero, but then I want to add negative two, which should take me two steps back down. This one takes me two steps even higher, so this one right over here is positive six plus two, or positive six plus positive two. This one over here we're starting at positive four and then we're adding two, so that's not what we're talking about. This one over here, this big arrow, this tall arrow. This is going, it's pointing up. It gets us to positive six. The tip of the arrows are at positive six, But then we're going back down too. So this would be positive six plus negative two. You could think of this arrow as representing positive six, and then this arrow is representing negative two. It takes us two down. So if you take positive six plus negative two, you do the positive six. And from the tip of your arrow, from there you can start the negative two, and you go two back down and you end up at four. So it's definitely that one right over there. This is surprisingly fun. Let's keep going. Which number line model represents the expression negative 2/5 plus 4/5? So we're going to start at negative 2/5 which is going to be, it's negative, it's going to be to the left of zero. So let's see, this arrow right over here, this is negative 4/5, so that's not going to be quite right. So the second choice, what's going on here? So if I start at zero, and then I'm going 2/5 to the left of zero. So that's negative 2/5 and from that, I'm going to the right 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5. So this looks right. This looks like negative 2/5, so I'm starting at zero, I'm going to the left 2/5. So that's negative 2/5, and then I go to the right 4/5 from that tip. >From negative 2/5, I'm adding 4/5. So that looks right. Let's do one more. This is exciting. Even if you don't find it fully exciting, anything you do you should convince yourself it's exciting. You'll do a better job. Which number line model represents the expression five 1/2 plus negative three? This is positive five 1/2, so I want to go five 1/2 to the right of zero. This is five 1/2 to the left of zero, so that's negative five 1/2. That's not what I want to deal with. So this one looks interesting, and this is actually five 1/2 to the left of zero as well, so it's probably going to be this but let's just look at it. So let's see, we go five 1/2 to the right of zero. So this is five 1/2, and then from that I go three left. So that in the end gets me to two 1/2. So it's this choice, right over there.

" -  What we're going to do in this video is think about what properties of a shape are preserved or not preserved, as they undergo a transformation. In particular, we're gonna think about rotations and reflections in this video. And both of those are rigid transformations which means that the length between corresponding points do not change. So for example, let's say we take this circle A, it's centered at Point A. And we were to rotate it around Point P. Point P is the center of rotation. And just for the sake of argument we rotate it clockwise a certain angle. So let's say we end up right over so we're gonna rotate that way. And let's say our center ends up right over here. So our new circle, the image after the rotation might look something like this. And I'm hand drawing it. So you got to forgive that it's not that well hand drawn of a circle. But the circle might look something like this. And so, the clear things that are preserved or maybe it's not so clear, we're gonna hope we make them clear right now. Things that are preserved under a rigid transformation like this rotation right over here. This is clearly a rotation. Things that are preserved well, you have things like the radius of the circle. The radius length, I could say, to be more particular. The radius here is two. The radius here is also is also two, right over there. You have things like the perimeter. Well, if the radius is preserved the perimeter of a circle which we call a circumference well, that's just a function of the radius. We're talking about two times pi times the radius. So the perimeter, of course, is going to be preserved. In fact, that follows from the fact that the length of the radius is preserved. And of course, if the radius is preserved and then the area is also going to be preserved. The area is just pi times the radius squared. So they have the same radius. They're gonna have all of these in common. And you could also that feels intuitively right. So what is not preserved? Not preserved. And this is in general true of rigid transformations is that they will preserve the distance between corresponding points if we're transforming a shape they'll preserve things like perimeter and area. And this case, I can set a perimeter. I can say circumference. Circumference. So they'll preserve things like that. They'll preserve angles. We don't have clear angles in this picture. But, they'll preserve things like angles. But what they won't preserve is the coordinates. Coordinates of corresponding points. They might sometimes, but not always. So for example, the coordinate of the center here is for sure, going to change. We go from the coordinate negative three comma zero. To here we went to the coordinate we went to the coordinate negative one comma two. So the coordinates are not preserved. Coordinates of the center. Let's do another example with a non-circular shape. And we'll do a different type of transformation. In this situation let us do a reflection. So, we have a quadrilateral here. Quadrilateral ABCD. And we want to think about what is preserved, or not preserved as we do a reflection across the line L. So let me write that down. We're gonna have a reflection in this situation. And we can even think about this without even doing the reflection ourselves. But let's just do the reflection really fast. So we're reflecting across the line XYZ equal to X. So what it essentially does to the coordinates is it swaps the X and Y coordinates. But you don't have to know that for the sake of this video. So, B prime would be right over here. A prime would be right over there. D prime would be right over here. And since C is right on the line now its image, C prime, won't change. And so our new when we reflect over the line L. And you don't have to know for the sake of this video, exactly how I did that fairly quickly. I really just want you to see what the reflection looks like. The real appreciation here is think about, well, what happens with rigid transformations. So, it's gonna look something like this. The reflection. The reflection looks something like this. So what's preserved? And in general, this is good to know for any rigid transformation what's preserved. Well, side lengths. That's actually one way that we even use to define what a rigid transformation is. A transformation that preserves the lengths between corresponding points. Angle measures. Angle measures. So, for example, this angle here, the angle A, is gonna be the same as the angle A prime over here. Side lengths, the distance between A and B is going to be the same as the distance between A prime and B prime. Perimeter. If you have the same side lengths and the same angles, the perimeter and area are also going to be preserved. Just like we saw with the rotation example. These are rigid transformations. These are the types of things that are preserved. Well, what is not preserved? Not preserved. And this just goes back to the example we just looked at. Well, coordinates are not preserved. So as we see, the image of A A prime has different coordinates than A. B prime has different coordinates than B. C prime, in this case, happens to have the same coordinates as C because C happens to sit on our, the line that we're reflecting over. But D prime definitely does not have the same coordinates as D. So, most of or let me say, coordinates of AB ABD. Coordinates of A B D not preserved. After transformation, or their images don't have the same coordinates. After transformation. The one coordinate that happened to be preserved here is Cs coordinates. Because it was right on the line of reflection. And you can also look at other properties so how it might relate how different segments might relate to lines that would not be that were not being transformed. So, for example, right over here before transformation, CD is parallel to the Y axis. You see this right over here. But after the transformation C prime D prime. So this could be C prime D prime is no longer parallel to the Y axis. In fact, now it is parallel to the X axis. So, when you have the relationship to things outside of the things we're transformed that relationship might not. Those relationships may no longer be true after the transformation.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_geometric-transformations
" - All right, what we've got here are 12 pirates. They're gonna divide up a treasure chest of gold. And here's how they're gonna do it. First pirate's gonna come along and take 1/12 of the gold that's in the chest. Second pirate's gonna come along, take 2/12 of the whatever's left after the first pirate is finished. Third pirate's gonna take 3/12 of whatever's left after the second pirate finished, and on, and on, and on. And let's see, what happens here? Each pirate gets a positive whole number of coins, and the number of coins that was in the chest is the smallest number of coins for which it's possible for each pirate to get a positive number of coins, positive whole number of coins using this process. And we're gonna start with x 'cause x marks the spot. x is the number of coins that was in the chest at the beginning. And the first pirate comes along and takes 1/12, now there's 11/12 remaining for the next pirate who comes along. And the next pirate, second pirate, takes 2/12 and leaves 10/12 of what was there when she got there for the next pirate. So she gets there, there's this much. She's gonna leave 10/12 of this amount for the next pirate. Next pirate comes along takes 3/12, leaves 9/12 of this for the following pirate. And on and on and on we go until we get to the last few pirates. The 11th pirate takes 11/12, leaves 1/12 of what was there for the last pirate, who comes along and takes everything that's left. Well, that's what we wanna figure out, how much does this, the last pirate, receive? So we wanna figure out what the value of this expression is. And we can write this a lot shorter as x times 11 factorial over 12 to the 11th. And we wanna figure out what this is. Now, x is the smallest value that makes this an integer. Well, actually x is the smallest value that makes sure each pirate gets an integer number of coins. Don't worry about that right now. I'm just gonna worry about the last pirate and figure out what the last pirate gets. So, well if x, if you just choose x is 12 to the 11th, well then this will come out to be an integer. But 11 factorial is not any of these choices, so we can simplify this fraction. We can take out all the factors of two and three from this 11 factorial, see what's left. We're gonna be left with a factor of 11. And then we're gonna have two fives from the five and the 10. And we're gonna have a seven sitting in there. And then we need to figure out, well, we're gonna simplify this fraction, take out factors of two. I mean we could stop right here, just compute this and call that the answer, but I'm a little bothered by that whole every pirate has to get an integer number of coins thing. But let's go ahead and simplify this fraction. The number of twos in 11 factorial, the number of factors of two, you get two, four, six, eight, 10, that's five. You get an extra one from the four, two extra ones from the eight. Eight factors of two up here. There are 22 down there. That leaves us two to the 14th. And the factors of three. You have three, six, and nine up there. You get an extra factor of three in the nine. Four factors of three up there. Eleven down there. That leaves us three to the seventh. Now we can go ahead and multiply out this numerator seven times 11. That's 77 times 25. Well, 80 times 25, that's 2,000. So 77 times 25 is going to be 1925, and that makes us happy, 'cause 1925 is sitting right there, but you'd be forgiven for just circling the 1925, calling it D, and moving on, but seeing that 3850 right there, that scares me a little bit, makes me remember that each pirate has to get a positive whole number of coins, so maybe there's a reason we have to multiply by two somewhere. So one way to check your answer is just to work it through. Let x be two to the 14th times three to the seventh and see if each pirate gets a positive whole number of coins. Now if you're jammed on time on a test, you're gonna bubble D and move on, and that's probably the right thing to do, 'cause it sure looks like you're gonna get a positive, you're gonna get a whole number of coins at each step. But let's just check it real quick. We start off with two to the 14th times three to the seventh coins. What happens? We wanna make sure we end up with 1925 at the end, and we wanna make sure each pirate has a positive whole number of coins, so here we go. We start off with two to the 14th times three to the seventh coins. I'm gonna box this off 'cause we're gonna a need a little space here. First pirate's gonna take 1/12 of that. That's gonna work out just fine, and leave 11 times two, 11/12 of it, 11 times two to the 12th times three to the sixth. Now you see why we have to start worrying. We're gonna be chippin' away at these powers of two and three. We just don't ever wanna end up with a fractional number of coins. Next pirate comes along, he needs to take 2/12, 1/6 of this. That's gonna work out just fine, and gonna leave 5/6 of this amount, leaving 5/6 of this gives us a factor of five there, but it's gonna take away another factor of two, another factor of three. Next person comes along, takes 1/4 of the coins, leaves 3/4 of the coins. So that's gonna throw another factor of three back in, but take two factors of two away. So this is how may coins we have left. Then the next one comes in and takes 1/3, that's 4/12, leaves 2/3 of this amount, takes away a factor of three, throws in another factor of two. Next one's gonna come along, take 5/12, leave 7/12, so that's seven times 55. Now we're knockin' out two factors of two and a factor of three. Next one's gonna come along, take half, leave half. That one's pretty easy, just knocks out another factor of two. Next one comes along, takes 7/12, leaves 5/12, and we know what five times seven times 55 is now. We've already computed that. 1925 times two to the fifth, times three cubed. Next one comes in and takes away 8/12, leaving 4/12 of this amount, so leaving 1/3 of this, leaving 1925 times two to the fifth times three squared. Whew, almost there. Next one comes along, takes 3/4, leaves 1/4 of this amount. And then the next one comes along, that's this one right here, is taking 10/12, leaving 2/12, leaving 1/6 of this amount. As you can see, at each step, the pirate who's walkin' away with the loot is walking away with an integer number of coins. And finally here at the end, the last one's gonna come in and take 11/12 of this which is gonna work out just fine. You're gonna get a whole number of coins because we have that factor of 12 right there, and we're gonna leave 1/12 remaining, which is the 1925 coins. So if you had just bubbled D and moved on, it all worked out just fine. And we're done.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_amc-10
" I have a function here defined as x squared minus 5x plus 6. And what I want us to think about is what other forms we can write this function in if we, say, wanted to find the 0s of this function. If we wanted to figure out where does this function intersect the x-axis, what form would we put this in? And then another form for maybe finding out what's the minimum value of this. We see that we have a positive coefficient on the x squared term. This is going to be an upward-opening parabola. But what's the minimum point of this? Or even better, what's the vertex of this parabola right over here? So if the function looks something like this, we could use one form of the function to figure out where does it intersect the x-axis. So where does it intersect the x-axis? And maybe we can manipulate it to get another form to figure out what's the minimum point. What's this point right over here for this function? I don't even know if the function looks like this. So I encourage you to pause this video and try to manipulate this into those two different forms. So let's work on it. So in order to find the roots, the easiest thing I can think of doing is trying to factor this quadratic expression which is being used to define this function. So we could think about, well, let's think of two numbers whose product is positive 6 and whose sum is negative 5. So since their product is positive, we know that they have the same sign. And if they have the same sign but we get to a negative value, that means they both must be negative. So let's see-- negative 2 times negative 3 is positive 6. Negative 2 plus negative 3 is negative 5. So we could rewrite f of x. And so let me write it this way. We could write f of x as being equal to x minus 2 times x minus 3. Now, how does this help us find the zeroes? Well, in what situations is this right-hand expression, is this expression on the right hand going to be equal to 0? Well, it's the product of these two expressions. If either one of these is equal to 0, 0 times anything is 0. 0 times anything else is 0. So this whole thing is going to be 0 if x minus 2 is equal to 0 or x minus 3 is equal to 0. Add 2 to both sides of this equation. You get x is equal to 2 or x is equal to 3. So those are the two zeroes for this function, I guess you could say. And we could already think about it a little bit in terms of graphing it. So let's try to graph this thing. So this is x equals 1. This is x equals 2. This is x equals 3 right over there. So that's our x-axis. That, you could say, is our y is equal to f of x axis. And we're seeing that we intersect both here and here. When x is equal to 2, this f of x is equal to 0. When x is equal to 3, f of x is equal to 0. And you could substitute either of these values into the original expression. And you'll see it's going to get you to 0 because that is the same thing as that. Now, what about the vertex? What form could we write this original thing in order to pick out the vertex? Well, we're already a little familiar with completing the square. And when you complete the square with this expression, that seems to be a pretty good way of thinking about what the minimum value of this function is. So let's just do that right over here. So I'm just going to rewrite it. So we get f of x is equal to x squared minus 5x. And I'm just going to throw the plus 6 right over here. And I'm giving myself some real estate because what I need to do, what I want to think about doing, is adding and subtracting the same value. So I'm going to add it here, and I'm going to subtract it there. And I can do that because then I've just added 0. I haven't changed the value of this right-hand side. But I want to do that so that this part that I've underlined in this magenta color, so that this part right over here, is a perfect square. And we've done this multiple times when we've completed the square. I encourage you to watch those videos if you need a little bit of a review on it. But the general idea is this is going to be a perfect square if we take this coefficient right over here. We take negative 5. We take 1/2 of that, which is negative 5/2, and we square it. So we could write this as plus negative-- what's negative 5/2 squared? So I could write this-- negative 5/2 squared. Well, if we square a negative number, it's just going to be a positive. So it's going to be the same thing as 5/2 squared. 5 squared is 25. 2 squared is 4. So this is going to be plus 25/4. Now, once again, if we want this equality to be true, we either have to add the same thing to both sides. Or if we're just operating on one side, if we added it to that side, we could just subtract it from that side. And we haven't changed the total value on that side. So we added 25/4, and we subtracted 25/4. So what is this part right over here? What does this become, the part that I've underlined in magenta? Well, this is going to be-- the whole reason why we engineered it in this way is so that this could be x minus 5/2 squared. And I encourage you to verify this. And we go into more detail about why taking 1/2 the coefficient here and then squaring it, adding it there and then subtracting there, why that works. We do that in the completing the square videos. But these two things, you can verify that they are equivalent. So that's that part. And now we just have to simplify 6 minus 25/4. So 6 could be rewritten as 24/4. 24/4 minus 25/4 is negative 1/4, so minus 1/4, just like that. So we've rewritten our original function as f of x is equal to x minus 5/2 squared minus 1/4. Now, why is this form interesting? Well, one way to think about it is this part is always going to be non-negative. The minimum value of this part in magenta is going to be 0. Why? Because we're squaring this thing. If you're taking something like this-- and we're just dealing with real numbers-- and you're squaring it, you're not going to be able to get a negative value. At the minimum value, this is going to be 0. And then it obviously could be positive values, as well. So if we want to think about when does this thing hit its minimum value-- well, it hits its minimum value when you're squaring 0. And when are you squaring 0? Well, you're squaring 0 when x minus 5/2 is equal to 0, or when x is equal to 5/2 if you just want to add 5/2 to both sides of that equation. So this thing hits its minimum value when x is equal to 5/2. And then what is y, or what is f of x, when x is equal to 5/2? f of 5/2-- and once again, you could use any of those forms to evaluate 5/2. But it's really easy in this form. When x is equal to 5/2, this term right over here becomes 0. 0 squared, 0. You're just left with negative 1/4. So another way to think about it is our vertex is at the point x equals 5/2, y equals negative 1/4. So x equals 5/2. That's the same thing as 2 and 1/2. So x equals 5/2. And y is equal to negative 1/4. So if that is negative 1, 1/4 would be something like that. So that right over there is the vertex. That is the point-- let me make it clear-- that's the point 5/2 comma negative 1/4. And what's cool is we've just used this form to figure out the minimum point, to figure out the vertex in this case. And then we can use the roots as two other points to get a rough sketch of what this parabola will actually look like. So the interesting-- or I guess the takeaway from this video is just to realize that we can rewrite this in different forms depending on what we're trying to understand about this function.",math_math2_quad-2
" -  Let's say that Y is equal to log base four of X squared plus X. What is the derivative of Y with respect to X going to be equal to? Now you might recognize immediately that this is a composite function. We're taking the log base four, not just of X, but we're taking that of another expression that involves X. So we could say we could say this thing in blue that's U of X. Let me do that in blue. So this thing in blue that is U of X. U of X is equal to X squared plus X. And it's gonna be useful later on to know what U prime of X is. So that's gonna be I'm just gonna use the power rule here so two X plus one I brought that two out front and decremented the exponent. Derivative with respect to X of X is one. And we can say the log base four of this stuff well we could call that a function V. We can say V of well if we said V of X this would be log base four of X. And then we've shown in other videos that V prime of X is, we're gonna be very similar that if this was log base E, or natural log, except we're going to scale it. So it's going to be one over one over log base four. Sorry, one over the natural log. The natural log of four times X. If this was V of X, if V of X was just natural log of X, our derivative would be one over X. But since it's log base four and this comes straight out of the change of base formulas that you might have seen. And we have a video where we show this. But we just scale it in the denominator with this natural log of four. You think of scaling the whole expression by one over the natural log of four. But we can now use this information because Y this Y can be viewed as V of V of. Remember, V is the log base four of something. But it's not V of X. We don't have just an X here. We have the whole expression that defines U of X. We have U of X right there. And let me draw a little line here so that we don't get those two sides confused. And so we know from the chain rule the derivative Y with respect to X. This is going to be this is going to be the derivative of V with respect to U. Or we could call that V prime. V prime of U of X. V prime of U of X. Let me do the U of X in blue. V prime of U of X times U prime of X. Well, what is V prime of U of X? We know what V prime of X is. If we want to know what V prime of U of X we would just replace wherever we see an X with a U of X. So, this is going to be equal to V prime of U X, U of X. And you just do is you take the derivative of the green function with respect to the blue function. So it's going to be one over the natural log of four. The natural log of four. Times, instead of putting an X there it would be times U of X. Times U of X. And of course, that whole thing times U prime of X. And so, and I'm doing more steps just hopefully so it's clearer what I'm doing here. So this is one over the natural log of four. U of X is X squared plus X. So X squared plus X. And then we're gonna multiply that times U prime of X. So times two X plus one. And so we can just rewrite this as two X plus one over over over the natural log of four. The natural log of four times X squared plus X. Times X squared plus X. And we're done, and we could distribute this natural log of four if we found that interesting. But, we have just found the derivative of Y with respect to X.",math_calculus-1_cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics
" What we're going to try to do in this video is approximate the area under the curve y is equal to x squared plus 1 between the intervals x equals 1 and x equals 3. And we're going to approximate it by constructing four rectangles under the curve of equal width. So let's first think about what those rectangles look like, so four rectangles of equal width. So it looks like that, like that, and like that. And I haven't really defined the top of the rectangles just yet. But let's think about what those widths have to be if they're going to be equal width. And we can call that width delta x. So this distance right over here, we're going to call that delta x. So delta x is going to have to be the total distance that we're traveling in x. So we finish at 3. We started at 1. And we want four equal-width rectangles. So it's going to be equal to 1/2. So for example, this first interval between the boundary between the first rectangle and the second is going to be 1.5. Then we go 1/2 to 2. Then we go to 2.5. And then we go 1/2 to 3. Now, let's think about how we'll define the height of the rectangles. For the sake of this video-- we'll see in future videos that there's other ways of doing this-- I'm going to use the left boundary of the rectangle to define the height-- or the function, I should say. I'm going to use the function evaluated at the left boundary to define the height. So for example, for the first rectangle, this point right over here is f of 1. And so I will say that that is the height of our first rectangle. Then we go over here to the left boundary of the second rectangle. We're now looking at the function evaluated at 1.5. So that is f of 1.5. That's the height. And so we get our second rectangle. Then, we get-- I can keep going like this-- we get, for this third rectangle, we have the function evaluated at 2. So that's right over here. That's f of 2. And so then we get our third rectangle. And then, finally, we have our fourth rectangle, the function evaluated at 2.5. So the function evaluated at 2.5 is the height. So this is f of 2.5. Remember, in each of these, I'm just looking at the left boundary of the rectangle and evaluating the function there to get the height of the rectangle. Now that I've set it up in this way, what is the total approximate area using the sum of these rectangles? And clearly, this isn't going to be a perfect approximation. I'm giving up on a bunch of area here. Let me see if I can color that in with a color that I have not used. So I'm giving up. I'm giving up this area. I'm giving up this area. I'm giving up that area. I'm giving up that area there. But this is just an approximation, and maybe if I had many more rectangles, it would be a better approximation. So let's figure out what the areas of each of the rectangles are. So the area of this first rectangle is going to be the height, which is f of 1, times the base, which is delta x. The area of the second rectangle is going to be the height, which we already said was f of 1.5, times the base, times delta x. The height of the third rectangle is going to be the function evaluated at its left boundary, so f of 2-- so plus f of 2 times the base, times delta x. And then, finally, the area of the third rectangle, the height is the function evaluated at 2.5, so plus-- that's a different color than what I wanted to use. I wanted to use that orange color-- so plus the function evaluated at 2.5 times the base. This is going to be equal to our approximate area-- let me make it clear-- approximate area under the curve, just the sum of these rectangles. So let's evaluate this. So this is going to be equal to f of-- it's going to be equal to the function evaluated at 1. 1 squared plus 1 is just 2, so it's going to be 2 times 1/2. Plus the function evaluated at 1.25. 1.25 squared is 2.25. And then you add 1 to it, it becomes 3.25. So plus 3.25 times 1/2. And then we have the function evaluated at 2. Well, 2 squared plus 1 is 5, so it's 5 times 1/2. And then finally, you have the function evaluated at 2.5. 2.5 squared is 6.25 plus 1. So that's 7.25 times 1/2. And just to make the math simpler, we can factor out the 1/2. So this is going to be equal to-- write 1/2 in a neutral color-- 1/2 times 2 plus 3.25 plus 5 plus 7.25, which is equal to 1/2 times-- let's see if I can do this in my head. 2 plus 5 is easy. That's 7. 3 plus 7 is 10. And then we have 0.25 plus 0.25, so it's going to be 10.5 plus 7 is 17.5. So 1/2 times 17.5, which is equal to 8.75, Which, once again, gives us an approximation. And clearly, the way I've drawn it right over here, for the function we're using, it's going to be an underestimate, because we've given up all that pink area that I had colored in before. It's an underestimate, but it's an approximation of the area under the curve. In the next few videos, we're going to try to generalize this to situations where we have an arbitrary function and we have an arbitrary number of rectangles. And we'll also start-- in videos after that, we'll look at rectangles where we define the height not by the left boundary, but by the right boundary, or by the midpoint. Or maybe we don't use rectangles at all. Maybe we might use things like trapezoids. Anyway, have fun.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-integration-new
" - Rewrite Y is equal to 2/3x plus 4/7 in standard form. The equation must be simplified, which means all numbers must be integers that do not share a common factor other than one. Alright, we'll worry about this second part in a little bit. Let's see if we can rewrite this. So it's Y is equal to 2/3x plus 4/7. Let me get my scratch pad out. So it's Y is equal to 2/3x plus 4/7. So the way that it's written right now, this is slope intercept form. It's written in the form Y is equal to mx plus b, where m in this case is 2/3 and b is 4/7. It's very easy to figure out what the slope and what the Y intercept is from this equation. But we wanna write this in standard form. Which would be the form Ax plus By is equal to C. And that extra text they were saying, the equation must be simplified. Which means all numbers must be integers that do not share a common factor other than one. That just means that A, B, and C in the standard form they want need to be integers. And they want them to not have any common factors. So if we got to the point of say 4x plus 2y is equal to 10, well this number, and this number, and this number are all divisible by two. They all have the common factor of two. So we would want to simplify it more. Divide them all by two and then you would get two so you divide this by two. You get 2x, divide this by two you'll get plus y is equal to 5. So this is the form that they're asking for and probably because it's just easier for the site to know that this is the right answer. Because there's obviously a bunch of forms in this way. So let's see if we can do that. Let's see if we can write it in standard form. So the first thing I would wanna do is, well there's a bunch of ways that you could approach it. The first thing you could try to do is well let's get rid of all of these fractions. And the best way to get rid of the fractions is to multiple by three and to multiply by seven. If you multiply by three you get rid of this fraction. If you multiply by seven you get rid of this fraction. So if you multiply three and you multiply by seven. Let me just rewrite it over here. There's actually also a couple of ways that we can do this. So if you multiply. So one way to do it. So we start with Y is equal to 2/3x plus 4/7. So if I multiply this side by three and I multiply by seven, I have to do that to this side as well. So this is going to be multiplied by three and multiplied by seven. So the left hand side becomes 21y. 21y. Three times seven of course is 21, we just figured that out. We would distribute the 21. 21 times 2/3, well let's see. 21 divided by three is seven, times two is 14. So it's gonna be 14x. And then 21 divided by seven is three times four is 12. So just like that I was able to get rid of the fractions. And now I wanna get all the X's and Y's on one side. So I wanna get this 14x onto the left side. So let's see if I can do that. So I'm gonna do that by. To get rid of this I would want to subtract 14x. I can't just do it on the right hand side I have to do it on the left hand side as well. So I wanna subtract 14x, and then what am I left with? Let me give myself a little bit more space. So on the left hand side I have negative 14x plus 21y. Plus 21y is equal to. Let's see and I subtracted 14x to get rid of this. And then I have this is equal to 12. Now let's see, am I done? Do these share any, do 14, 21, and 12 share any common factors? Let's see, 14 is divisible by two and seven. 21 is divisible by three and seven. 12 is divisible by two, six, three, four. But all of these aren't divisible by the same number. 14, let's see. 14 is divisible two, so is 12, but 21 isn't. 14 is divisible by seven, so is 21, but 12 isn't. And 21 and 12 are divisible by three but 14 isn't. So I think this is about as simplified as I could get. If there was a common factor for all three of these numbers then I would divide all of them the way I did in that previous example. But that's not the case right over here. So it's negative 14x plus 21y is equal to 12. So let me see if I can remember that and type that in. So it is, negative 14x plus 21y is equal to 12. Now let's see if I got it right. It worked out.",math_algebra_forms-of-linear-equations
" -  We're told Sloan went on a four-day hiking trip. Each day, she walked 20% more than the distance that she walked the day before. She walked a total of 27 kilometers. What is the distance Sloan walked in the first day of the trip? And it says to round our final answer to the nearest kilometer. So, like always, have a go with this and see if you can figure out how much she walked on the first day. All right, well let's just call the amount that she walked on the first day a. And then using a, let's see if we can set up an expression for how much she walked in total. And then, that should be equal to 27. And then hopefully, we're going to be able to solve for a. So the first day, she walks a kilometers. Now, how about the second day? Well, they tell us that each day, she walked 20% more than the distance she walked the day before. So, on the next day, she's going to walk 20% more than a kilometers, so that's 1.2 times a. And what about the day after that, her third day? Well, that's just gonna be 1.2 times this, the second day, and so that's going to be 1.2 times 1.2, or we can say 1.2 squared times a. And then how much on the fourth day? And that's, she went on a four-day hiking trip, so that's the last day. Well, that's gonna be 1.2 times the third day. So, that's going to be 1.2 to the third power times a. So, this is an expression in a on how much she walked over the four days. And we know that she walked a total of 27 kilometers, so this is going to be equal to 27 kilometers. Now, you could solve for a over here. You could factor out the a and you could say a times one plus 1.2 plus 1.2 squared plus 1.2 to the third power is equal to 27. And then you could say that a is equal to 27 over one plus 1.2 plus 1.2 squared plus 1.2 to the third power, and we would need a calculator to evaluate this. But I'm gonna do a different technique, a technique that would work even if you had 20 terms here. You, in theory, could also do this with 20 terms but it gets a lot more complicated, or if you had 200 terms. So the other way to approach this is use the formula for a finite geometric series. What does it evaluate to? And just as a reminder, the sum of first n terms, it's going to be the first term, which we could call a, minus the first term times our common ratio. In this case, our common ratio is 1.2 because every successive term is 1.2 times the first. So our first term times our common ratio to the nth power, all of that over one minus the common ratio. In other videos, we explain where this comes from, we prove this, but here, we can just apply it. We already know what our a is, I used that as our variable. Our common ratio in this situation is going to be equal to 1.2. And our n is going to be equal to four. Another way I like to think about it is it's our first term, which we see right over there, minus the term that we did not get to. If we were to have a fifth term, it would have been that fifth term that we're subtracting because we aren't getting to a fourth power here, the fifth term would have been the fourth power, all of that over one minus the common ratio. And so, this left-hand side of our equation, we could rewrite as our first term minus our first term times our common ratio, 1.2, to the fourth power. All of that over one minus our common ratio. And then that could be equal to 27. Let me scroll down a little bit so we have some more space to then solve this. And so, let's see, I can simplify this a little bit. This is going to be equal to negative 0.2. Our numerator, we can factor out a. And so, this is going to be equal to a times one minus 1.2 to the fourth power. And let's see, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by negative one. And so, this would get us to a times, a times, and I'll put the a out of the fraction, a time, so I'll just swap the order here and get rid of this negative. 1.2 to the fourth power minus one over 0.2 is equal to 27. Again, all I did is I took the a out of the fraction so it's out here, and I multiplied the numerator and the denominator by negative. The numerator multiplied by negative would swap these two. And then multiplying negative 0.2 times negative is just positive 0.2. And so now, I can just multiply both sides times the reciprocal of this. So, I'll do up here. So, 0.2 over 1.2 to the fourth minus one. And then here, 0.2 over 1.2 to the fourth minus one. That cancels with that, that cancels with that, that's exactly why I did that. And we're left with a is equal to, it is equal to, I'll just write it in yellow, 27 times 0.2, all of that over 1.2 to the fourth minus one. And this expression should give us the exact same value as that expression we just saw, but this is useful even if we had a hundred terms, we could use this. And so, I'll get the calculator out. This will give us... So, actually, I'll evaluate this denominator first, so I'll have 1.2 to the fourth power, which is equal to minus one, is equal to, and that's in the denominator, so I could just take the reciprocal of it, and then multiply that, times 27 times 0.2 is equal to 5.029. Now, they want us to round our answer to the nearest kilometer, so this is going to be approximately equal to, approximately equal to five kilometers. That's how much approximately that she would have traveled on the first day of her hiking trip.",math_math3_factorization
" Show 109% by shading. So just as a bit of review, 109% if we were to write it out, would literally be 109 percent, which is the same thing as 109 per-- and I could write cent again, but that's getting old. Cent means 100, so it literally means 109 per hundred. If you had 100 per 100, you're dealing with the whole, but now we have more than a whole. We have 109 per 100. We can actually write this as a ratio, or as a fraction. This is the same thing as 109 per 100. It's the the same thing as 109/100. So let's shade that in. So we have a whole here, so we could consider this square a whole. In the last video, we counted. This is a 10 by 10 square. It is cut up into 100 pieces. So if we want 109 of those 100 pieces, what are we talking about? That means we're going to shade in all of the 100 right over here. Let me do that in a new color. So we'll shade in all of this. If you just shaded that in, that would be 100%. That would be 100/100, or 100 per 100, or 100%. I think you're getting the meaning of all of this. I don't just want you just memorize this stuff. This really just means 100 out of 100, or a whole. And you can see that this is the whole square. That's 100 out of 100 right there. The question is saying show us 109% by shading. We already did 100 per 100, but we need to do another 9, so let's shade in another 9. So now we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. So this piece right here, you could almost view that is-- well, that is! That is 9% of an entire square. This is 100% of an entire square. If you considered this whole thing plus this blue area right over here, you are talking about 109% of one whole square. Hopefully, that made sense.",math_7th-grade-foundations-engageny_7th-m4-engage-ny-foundations
" - Let's explore Sign Convention in this video. Basically we're gonna talk about the rules that we're going to apply positive and negative signs to measurements. Now you may be having a lot of questions in your mind. As in what measurements are we talking about? Why are we applying signs here all of a sudden? And where are we going to use them? So what we'll do is, we'll first look at what the rules are. Then we'll look at some of the examples. And then, hopefully, you'll kind of, sort of make sense why are we talking about it and where it's going to be useful. And one last thing before we begin. Although in this video we are only going to talk about mirrors. If you are watching this video while studying about lenses. Then the same rules are gonna be applied even for lenses as well. Just wanted to clear that out. And, by the way if you are not studying lenses or you haven't studied them yet don't worry about it. So let's start with the rules, and to understand these rules let's take one example. Let's say we have a concave mirror with us, and by the way this is called a concave mirror because the reflecting side is forming a cave. So what are the rules now? Rule number one, is that all the distances are measured from the pole. We call what pole is. Pole is the center of this mirror. Now when I say all distances, honestly there are only three distances. One is the focal length, how far the focus is. Then object distance, how far the object is. And the image distance, how far the image is. All the three distances are measured always from the pole. That's rule number one which I will not write down. Now rule number two is, when you measure these distances, these distances can be measured either in front of the mirror or it can be measured behind the mirror. To give you an example: Images. Sometimes the images will be formed in front of the mirror. And you may have seen that sometimes it can be formed behind the mirror. So to differentiate between the two distances. We're gonna call one of this measurement as positive. And the other measurement as negative. So the second rule is to figure out which distance then should we call positive. Alright. And let me write this down. The rule is we always chose incident direction as positive. Incident direction is always chosen as positive. So what do we mean by this? Well if we come back over here. Notice that because this is the reflecting side over here, the incident light will always be to the right side. Because, you know you'd keep an object over here and notice where the incident ray would be. Incident ray, if you we're to draw any would always be to the right. And so since incident direction is positive. In this example, right side is positive. And what do we mean by right side? The right side of the pole, because all measurements are done from the pole. So any measurement which is towards the right side of the pole, in this particular example will be positive measurement. And any measurement which you'll do to the left side of the pole will be negative measurement. So to take an example, imagine we are given the focal length of this mirror as two centimeters, everything is in centimeters let's say. There's an object kept at 3.5 centimeters from the pole. And let's say, once we draw ray diagrams we figure out that the image is formed at five centimeters from the pole. These numbers may not be accurate, I don't know. But just take an example. Now let's assign signs to them. Let's start with the object distance. Notice that the object is lying on the negative side. Therefore, this object distance would be negative. Similarly look at the focus. The focus lies on the negative side of the pole. Therefore, this focal length would be negative. Similarly look at the image. The image lies also on the negative side. So here the image distance would be negative. Alright, let's take one more example. And it would be great if you could pause the video, and see if you can try this yourself. So just pause the video and apply signs to these three distances. Remember, incident direction is always chosen as positive. Alright. So incident direction is taken as positive. Over here this is the reflecting side, and our object is over here. So the incident rays will be towards the left. Therefore, you start from the pole and all the measurements to the left are considered as positive this time. Does that make sense? Because you are choosing, because our incident ray is to the left. And all the measurements to the right side now will be negative. And so the object is on the negative side, so it'll get a minus sign. The focal length color you'll notice is on the positive side. The focus is on the positive side, so this focal length is positive. And similarly if you look at the image it's on the positive side. So that image distance will be positive. Alright now there's one more rule. And that rule has something to do with heights. Sometimes when you consider objects and images, the heights will be above the principal axis and sometimes the height will be below the principal axis. Again we'll differentiate between them. We're gonna call as one, one of them as positive. The other one as negative. So again the rule that we're gonna follow with here is you're gonna choose above principal axis or (muffled speaking) I'd like to just say, up is positive. Alright? So if there's any height which is above the principal axis, we'll call it as a positive height. And if there's any height below the principal axis we'll call it as a negative height. So if we knew the height of this object. I don't know, maybe say the height of this object was five centimeters, then that would be a positive height. Alright. And whatever is the height of this image, that will be a negative height. I'm pretty sure You can understand this. Since this object height is above the principal axis it will be a positive height, whatever the height is. And look at the image, again the height is above the principal axis. This will be a positive height as well. And that's it for Sign Conventions. So we have three rules. All the distances are measured from the pole. Then you start from the pole and you go in the incident direction that's chosen as positive. And when it comes to heights. Any height above the principal axis is chosen as positive. And by the way, this rule is given a name, this particular convention that we are following. It's called as the Cartesian Sign Convention. Cartesian Signs. And the word Cartesian might remind you of a graph. And the reason behind it is because that's what we do in graphs as well, right. In graphs we start from the origin. And we choose the right side usually as positive, left side is negative, upwards is positive, downwards is negative. That's basically what we're doing over here as well. We're treating the pole os the origin because you're measuring all the distances from the pole. And instead of choosing right side as positive, the only difference is you are choosing incident direction as positive. That's it. But pretty much everything else is the same as graph. That's why it's called the Cartesian Signs. Now one small thing is that in some textbooks they follow this a little differently. It's pretty much the same so the only different thing that they would do is while drawing the diagrams they will always make sure that the incident direction is drawn to the right. Okay. They will always make sure this is true. Then, automatically the right side will always be positive. Alright. For example they would recommend never to draw like this. Because over here incident direction is to the left. They will always recommend you make sure that your object lies on the left side of the mirror. So we have to flip this whole image. So basically they say that you always draw in such a way that the incident direction is to the right. Alright. And then we can always choose the right side as positive, which is what we do usually in any graph. So it's more aligned to the graphical system. Okay. Now you can follow that, obviously, but in general what I like to remember is you draw however you want. Just take incident direction as positive. So anything you can follow it's pretty much the same thing. So the last thing we'll talk about is, why do we even consider signs? And for that, let's take an example where we've already done this before. So an example of things falling under a gravity. You may recall that whenever things are falling under gravity, usually when an object is falling down we would say it's velocity is negative. And when it's going upwards you would say it's velocity is positive. If we didn't use that sign we might have to explicitly say in English the velocity is downwards, the velocity is upwards. But we don't like that. We want to reduce English and use math as much as possible. So Sign tell us what direction the ball is traveling mathematically. And the idea with here is exactly the same. Without signs we have to explicitly mention we're dealing with a concave mirror, or a convex mirror, or the images in front of the mirror, or the images behind the mirror. But with Signs these things are done mathematically. For example, if I just say negative focal length it automatically means it's a concave mirror. Positive focal length, convex mirror. If I say the object distance, or let's say the image distance is negative automatically it means it's in front of the mirror. It's positive automatically means it's behind the mirror. So long story short, Signs help us differentiate between the directions 1in which you are doing the measurement mathematically.",science_in-in-class10th-physics_in-in-10th-physics-light-reflection-refraction
" -  We’re told, ""the graph of the function f of x ""is equal to x-squared."" We see it right over here in grey. It’s shown in the grid below. ""Graph the function g of x is equal to ""x minus two-squared, minus four ""in the interactive graph."" This is from the shifting functions exercise on Khan Academy, and we can see we can change the graph of g of x. But let’s see, we want to graph it properly, so let’s see how they relate. Well, let’s think about a few things. Let’s first just make g of x completely overlap. Okay, there you go. Now they're completely overlapping. And let’s see how they’re different. Well, g of x, if you look at what's going on here, instead of having an x-squared, we have an x minus two-squared. So, one way to think about it is, when x is zero, you have zero-squared is equal to zero. But how do you get zero here? Well, x has got to be equal to two. Two minus two-squared is zero-squared, if we don’t look at the negative four just yet. And so, we would want to shift this graph over two to the right. This is essentially how much do we shift to the right. It’s sometimes a little bit counterintuitive that we have a negative there, because you might say, well, negative, that makes me think that I want to shift to the left. But you have to remind yourself is like, well okay, for the original graph, when it was just x-squared, to get the zero-squared, I just have to put x equals zero. Now to get a zero-squared, I have to put in a two. So this is actually shifting the graph to the right. And so, what do we do with this negative four? Well, this is a little bit more intuitive, or at least for me when I first learned it. This literally will just shift the graph down. Whatever your value is of x minus two-squared, it's gonna shift it down by four. So what we wanna do is just shift both of these points down by four. So this is gonna go from nine, and this is gonna go from the coordinate five comma nine, to five comma, if we go down four, five comma five. And this is gonna go from two comma zero, to two comma negative four. Two comma negative four. Did I do that right? I think that’s right. What, essentially, what we have going on is, g of x is f of x shifted two to the right and four down. Two to the right and four down. And notice, if you look at the vertex here, we shifted two to the right and four down. And I shifted this one also, this one also I shifted two to the right, and four down. And, there you have it. We have graphed g of x, which is a shifted version of f of x.",math_algebra-home_alg-functions
" I thought I would do a few examples using the angle bisector theorem. So in this first triangle right over here, we're given that this side has length 3, this side has length 6. And this little dotted line here, this is clearly the angle bisector, because they're telling us that this angle is congruent to that angle right over there. And then they tell us that the length of just this part of this side right over here is 2. So from here to here is 2. And that this length is x. So let's figure out what x is. So the angle bisector theorem tells us that the ratio of 3 to 2 is going to be equal to 6 to x. And then we can just solve for x. So 3 to 2 is going to be equal to 6 to x. And then once again, you could just cross multiply, or you could multiply both sides by 2 and x. That kind of gives you the same result. If you cross multiply, you get 3x is equal to 2 times 6 is 12. x is equal to, divide both sides by 3, x is equal to 4. So in this case, x is equal to 4. And this is kind of interesting, because we just realized now that this side, this entire side right over here, is going to be equal to 6. So even though it doesn't look that way based on how it's drawn, this is actually an isosceles triangle that has a 6 and a 6, and then the base right over here is 3. It's kind of interesting. Over here we're given that this length is 5, this length is 7, this entire side is 10. And then we have this angle bisector right over there. And we need to figure out just this part of the triangle, between this point, if we call this point A, and this point right over here. We need to find the length of AB right over here. So once again, angle bisector theorem, the ratio of 5 to this, let me do this in a new color, the ratio of 5 to x is going to be equal to the ratio of 7 to this distance right over here. And what is that distance? Well, if the whole thing is 10, and this is x, then this distance right over here is going to be 10 minus x. So the ratio of 5 to x is equal to 7 over 10 minus x. And we can cross multiply 5 times 10 minus x is 50 minus 5x. And then x times 7 is equal to 7x. Add 5x to both sides of this equation, you get 50 is equal to 12x. We can divide both sides by 12, and we get 50 over 12 is equal to x. And we can reduce this. Let's see if you divide the numerator and denominator by 2, you get this is the same thing as 25 over 6, which is the same thing, if we want to write it as a mixed number, as 4, 24 over 6 is 4, and then you have 1/6 left over. 4 and 1/6. So this length right over here is going, oh sorry, this length right over here, x is 4 and 1/6. And then this length over here is going to be 10 minus 4 and 1/6. What is that? 5 and 5/6.",math_engageny-geo_geo-2
" Let's do some compound inequality problems, and these are just inequality problems that have more than one set of constraints. You're going to see what I'm talking about in a second. So the first problem I have is negative 5 is less than or equal to x minus 4, which is also less than or equal to 13. So we have two sets of constraints on the set of x's that satisfy these equations. x minus 4 has to be greater than or equal to negative 5 and x minus 4 has to be less than or equal to 13. So we could rewrite this compound inequality as negative 5 has to be less than or equal to x minus 4, and x minus 4 needs to be less than or equal to 13. And then we could solve each of these separately, and then we have to remember this ""and"" there to think about the solution set because it has to be things that satisfy this equation and this equation. So let's solve each of them individually. So this one over here, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation. The left-hand side, negative 5 plus 4, is negative 1. Negative 1 is less than or equal to x, right? These 4's just cancel out here and you're just left with an x on this right-hand side. So the left, this part right here, simplifies to x needs to be greater than or equal to negative 1 or negative 1 is less than or equal to x. So we can also write it like this. X needs to be greater than or equal to negative 1. These are equivalent. I just swapped the sides. Now let's do this other condition here in green. Let's add 4 to both sides of this equation. The left-hand side, we just get an x. And then the right-hand side, we get 13 plus 14, which is 17. So we get x is less than or equal to 17. So our two conditions, x has to be greater than or equal to negative 1 and less than or equal to 17. So we could write this again as a compound inequality if we want. We can say that the solution set, that x has to be less than or equal to 17 and greater than or equal to negative 1. It has to satisfy both of these conditions. So what would that look like on a number line? So let's put our number line right there. Let's say that this is 17. Maybe that's 18. You keep going down. Maybe this is 0. I'm obviously skipping a bunch of stuff in between. Then we would have a negative 1 right there, maybe a negative 2. So x is greater than or equal to negative 1, so we would start at negative 1. We're going to circle it in because we have a greater than or equal to. And then x is greater than that, but it has to be less than or equal to 17. So it could be equal to 17 or less than 17. So this right here is a solution set, everything that I've shaded in orange. And if we wanted to write it in interval notation, it would be x is between negative 1 and 17, and it can also equal negative 1, so we put a bracket, and it can also equal 17. So this is the interval notation for this compound inequality right there. Let's do another one. Let me get a good problem here. Let's say that we have negative 12. I'm going to change the problem a little bit from the one that I've found here. Negative 12 is less than 2 minus 5x, which is less than or equal to 7. I want to do a problem that has just the less than and a less than or equal to. The problem in the book that I'm looking at has an equal sign here, but I want to remove that intentionally because I want to show you when you have a hybrid situation, when you have a little bit of both. So first we can separate this into two normal inequalities. You have this inequality right there. We know that negative 12 needs to be less than 2 minus 5x. That has to be satisfied, and-- let me do it in another color-- this inequality also needs to be satisfied. 2 minus 5x has to be less than 7 and greater than 12, less than or equal to 7 and greater than negative 12, so and 2 minus 5x has to be less than or equal to 7. So let's just solve this the way we solve everything. Let's get this 2 onto the left-hand side here. So let's subtract 2 from both sides of this equation. So if you subtract 2 from both sides of this equation, the left-hand side becomes negative 14, is less than-- these cancel out-- less than negative 5x. Now let's divide both sides by negative 5. And remember, when you multiply or divide by a negative number, the inequality swaps around. So if you divide both sides by negative 5, you get a negative 14 over negative 5, and you have an x on the right-hand side, if you divide that by negative 5, and this swaps from a less than sign to a greater than sign. The negatives cancel out, so you get 14/5 is greater than x, or x is less than 14/5, which is-- what is this? This is 2 and 4/5. x is less than 2 and 4/5. I just wrote this improper fraction as a mixed number. Now let's do the other constraint over here in magenta. So let's subtract 2 from both sides of this equation, just like we did before. And actually, you can do these simultaneously, but it becomes kind of confusing. So to avoid careless mistakes, I encourage you to separate it out like this. So if you subtract 2 from both sides of the equation, the left-hand side becomes negative 5x. The right-hand side, you have less than or equal to. The right-hand side becomes 7 minus 2, becomes 5. Now, you divide both sides by negative 5. On the left-hand side, you get an x. On the right-hand side, 5 divided by negative 5 is negative 1. And since we divided by a negative number, we swap the inequality. It goes from less than or equal to, to greater than or equal to. So we have our two constraints. x has to be less than 2 and 4/5, and it has to be greater than or equal to negative 1. So we could write it like this. x has to be greater than or equal to negative 1, so that would be the lower bound on our interval, and it has to be less than 2 and 4/5. And notice, not less than or equal to. That's why I wanted to show you, you have the parentheses there because it can't be equal to 2 and 4/5. x has to be less than 2 and 4/5. Or we could write this way. x has to be less than 2 and 4/5, that's just this inequality, swapping the sides, and it has to be greater than or equal to negative 1. So these two statements are equivalent. And if I were to draw it on a number line, it would look like this. So you have a negative 1, you have 2 and 4/5 over here. Obviously, you'll have stuff in between. Maybe, you know, 0 sitting there. We have to be greater than or equal to negative 1, so we can be equal to negative 1. And we're going to be greater than negative 1, but we also have to be less than 2 and 4/5. So we can't include 2 and 4/5 there. We can't be equal to 2 and 4/5, so we can only be less than, so we put a empty circle around 2 and 4/5 and then we fill in everything below that, all the way down to negative 1, and we include negative 1 because we have this less than or equal sign. So the last two problems I did are kind of ""and"" problems. You have to meet both of these constraints. Now, let's do an ""or"" problem. So let's say I have these inequalities. Let's say I'm given-- let's say that 4x minus 1 needs to be greater than or equal to 7, or 9x over 2 needs to be less than 3. So now when we're saying ""or,"" an x that would satisfy these are x's that satisfy either of these equations. In the last few videos or in the last few problems, we had to find x's that satisfied both of these equations. Here, this is much more lenient. We just have to satisfy one of these two. So let's figure out the solution sets for both of these and then we figure out essentially their union, their combination, all of the things that'll satisfy either of these. So on this one, on the one on the left, we can add 1 to both sides. You add 1 to both sides. The left-hand side just becomes 4x is greater than or equal to 7 plus 1 is 8. Divide both sides by 4. You get x is greater than or equal to 2. Or let's do this one. Let's see, if we multiply both sides of this equation by 2/9, what do we get? If you multiply both sides by 2/9, it's a positive number, so we don't have to do anything to the inequality. These cancel out, and you get x is less than 3 times 2/9. 13/9 is the same thing as 1/3, so x needs to 1be less than 2/3. 1So or x is less than 2/3. 1So that's our solution set. 1x needs to be greater than or equal to 2, or less than 2/3. 1So this is interesting. 1Let me plot the solution set on the number line. 1So that is our number line. 1Maybe this is 0, this is 1, this is 2, 3, maybe that is 1negative 1. 1So x can be greater than or equal to 2. 1So we could start-- let me do it in another color. 1We can start at 2 here and it would be greater than or equal 1to 2, so include everything greater than or equal to 2. 1That's that condition right there. 1Or x could be less than 2/3. 1So 2/3 is going to be right around here, right? 1That is 2/3. 1x could be less than 2/3. 1And this is interesting. 1Because if we pick one of these numbers, it's going to 1satisfy this inequality. 1If we pick one of these numbers, it's going to satisfy 1that inequality. 1If we had an ""and"" here, there would have been no numbers 1that satisfy it because you can't be both greater than 2 1and less than 2/3. 1So the only way that there's any solution set here is 1because it's ""or."" You can satisfy one of the two 1inequalities. 1Anyway, hopefully you, found that fun.",math_algebra_solve-equations-inequalities
" -  I have two water molecules right over here, and typically the water molecules, as they interact with each other, they form these hydrogen bonds that's due to the polarity of the water molecule. We've talked a lot about that, they slide past each other, these hydrogen bonds give them all these neat properties of water. But chemistry is much messier, than sometimes our diagrams or explanations show. There's all sorts of crazy interactions. All of these things are bumping into each other in all different ways. And not only are the molecules bumping in different ways, but any given moment, the electrons are jumping around and, on average, they might spend more time, they might spend more time around the oxygen forming a partially negative charge at that end, and then a partially positive charge near the hydrogens, because the hydrogens are having their electrons hogged away from them. In fact this is what forms the hydrogen bonds. But there's always constantly change there. Because they're all just jumping around. It's all very probabilistic. And so you can imagine, under just the right conditions, one oxygen or one water molecule, might just graze this water molecule in the right way, that these electrons, that these electrons, get close enough to nab, to nab this hydrogen. But it doesn't nab the entire hydrogen. It doesn't nab the nucleus and the electron, and a typical hydrogen atom, a typical hydrogen atom, actually let me draw it. A typical hydrogen atom is just a proton, is just a proton in the nucleus. Actually the most typical isotope of hydrogen has no neutron, so it's just a proton in the nucleus. And an electron orbiting around it. So this right over here is positive, actually maybe I'll draw it that way, you have a positive proton, and then you have a negative electron, you have a negative electron orbiting around it. Actually it's more of a orbital. So it's really this electron is jumping all around it. But you could imagine, these electrons in this covalent bond, they were already being, these we already being hogged, these were already being hogged by this oxygen, in fact that's what was forming this partial negative charge over here, and the partial positive charge over here. So these would be attracted to this partial positive charge. Remember there, you have a partial negative charge over here, this is actually what's forming the hydrogen bond. And it actually could bond to the hydrogen proton, while both of these electrons, including one of these electrons that used to be part of this hydrogen, or you could consider used to be part of that hydrogen, are nabbed, are nabbed by this oxygen. And in this circumstance, and I'm not saying that this happens all the time, but under just the right conditions, this actually can happen, and what would result, so let me, what result is, this thing over here, instead of just being a neutral water molecule, would look like this. So you have your oxygen, you have, not only your two hydrogens now, you now have a third hydrogen. You now have a third hydrogen. So you have theses two covalent bonds, these two covalent bonds, this lone pair. And now this lone pair, which I have circled in blue, is now being shared with this hydrogen proton. This electron right over here of the hydrogen got nabbed by this oxygen. So now you've formed another covalent bond. And now this character over here, he's lost the hydrogen proton, but he's kept all of the electrons. So this character over here's gonna look like this. You're gonna have your oxygen, and now it's only going to only be bonded to one hydrogen, only bonded to one hydrogen. Has these two original lone pairs. These two original lone pairs right over here. And then took both of the electrons from this covalent bond. And took both of the electrons from this covalent bond. And so it has another lone pair. So this molecule gained just a proton without getting any electrons. So if you do that, you're now going to have a net positive charge for this one over here. And this molecule over here, actually let me, let me, ugh, let me just write it. I wanna write it a little bit neater. And this molecule over here, so we have this molecule plus this one, this one lost a proton, without any other changes. So it now has a negative charge. So just like that, you went from two neutral water molecules, to two ions. And these ions, this one over here, the one on the left, the one that is now H three O, H three O, H three O, and it now has a positive charge, positive charge, actually I put that O in a different color. H three, H three O. It's a positive charge, this is called the ""hydronium ion."" Hydronium, hydronium. And this one over here, that is OH minus, so it's OH, O, let me get the colors right. OH minus. This is called the ""hydroxide ion,"" or since it's negative you can just call it an ""anion."" I'll just write ""hydroxide,"" hydroxide, hydroxide ion right over there. So you have this water and it's just kind of automatically under the right circumstances, this isn't happening a lot, but under the right circumstances, you could have one of the water molecules nabbing just the hydrogen proton, from another water molecule. And that water molecule is gonna keep both of the electrons, and then they ionize. They have autoionized, and this phenomenon, this is called ""the autoionization of water."" Let me write that down, it's a nice big word. Autoionization. Autoionization of, of water. And I really want to make it clear what happens. This hydrogen over here, that you can imagine at first was a proton and an electron, the typical isotope of hydrogen actually does not have a neutron. But then this electron got swiped. This electron, this electron was part of this bond and it gets swiped away, and so all you're left is with this proton, and this proton goes to this other water molecule, giving that a positive charge. And so you might say, ""Well how frequently would ""I find hydronium ions in water?"" Well the concentration, let me actually draw a little tub of water here, let's say this is a liter of water. This is a liter, this is a liter of water. The concentration of hydronium in typical water, the concentration of H three O, the concentration of H three O in typical water, and you put brackets around something to denote ""concentration,"" is one times ten to the negative seven molar. And molar, this just means ""moles per liter."" This is the same thing as one times ten to the negative seven moles, moles per liter. And now you might be saying, ""Well, what's a mole?"" Well I encourage you to watch the video on what a mole is, but a mole is a quantity. It's like saying, ""a dozen."" But it's a much larger, a dozen is equal to 12 of something. A mole is roughly equal to, let me write it. A mole is approximately equal to 6.02 times ten to the 23rd. Ten to the 23rd of something. And you're typically talking about molecules. A mole of a substance means approximately 6.022, it actually keeps going, times ten to the 23rd molecules of that thing. So you might say, ""Hey, one times ten to the negative seven ""times 6.02 times ten to the 23rd, ""that would still get us,"" well let's see, this, let me actually, let me write it down. One times ten to the negative seven moles per liter, times, times, I'll do it this way. Times six, I'll just go with six, since we're gonna go approximately. So approximately, six times ten to the 23rd. Six times 23rd molecules, molecules per mole. Molecules per mole, well these two would cancel out, and you would multiply these two numbers, you would get six times, let's see. Ten to the negtive seven times ten to the 23rd, that's still gonna be ten to the 16th power, molecules per liter. Molecules per liter, so your first reaction is, ""Oh my God!"" ""I'm gonna have six times,"" or roughly, I'll say roughly. ""Approximately six times ten to the 16th ""molecules of hydronium in this?"" ""That's a lot, we should see it all the time."" But we have to remind ourselves. There's just a lot of molecules of water in there as well. In fact, a liter of water is roughly, so one liter of H two O, contains, contains approximately 56, 56 moles, moles of H two O. So one way to think about it is, ""I have one, I have one times,"" and if I'm thinking about a liter of water, I have, I'll do it over here, ""I have one times ten to the negative seven ""moles of, moles of H three O for every, ""for every 56 moles, for every 56 moles, ""moles of H two O."" So if you look at this ratio, then you start to appreciate. The ratio of one times ten to the negative seven to 56. Let me do it down here. So this is the same thing as, one times ten to the negative seven to 56, is the same thing as, let's just multiply both side times, or the numerator and the denominator, times ten to the seventh. So if we do that, this is the same thing as one, one, the ratio of hydronium to regular water, to H two O is gonna be one to, let's see if I multiply 56, times ten to the seventh, I'm gonna have five, let me get, write in that same color. I'm gonna have five six, then I'm gonna have, I'm gonna throw seven zeros at the end of it. Let me do that. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. 1So the ratio of hydronium to regular H two O 1is one for ever five hundred and sixty million. 1So even though you might say, ""Oh wow, look."" 1""We're gonna have a huge number of molecules 1""of hydronium in this liter of water."" 1For every one of them, you actually have 1roughly five hundred sixty million molecules of H two O. 1So that should give you an appreciation for the 1fact that this isn't that typical. 1In fact, you're gonna see this much more often 1than you see this over here. 1In fact, if you wanted to make these arrows 1kind of show which direction the equilibrium sits in, 1it's actually much further, it's actually much further 1to the left. 1So we could make this arrow much bigger. 1But it also gives you an appreciation 1for just how many molecules you have sitting 1in a liter, in a liter of water.",science_biology_water-acids-and-bases
" - [Tutor] Let's see if we can figure out what four and four fifths divided by one and one half is and I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can figure it out on your own and I'll give you a hint, see if you can rewrite these mixed numbers as what is sometimes called improper fractions. Alright, now let's do this together, so how can we rewrite four and four fifths? Well, four and four fifths is the same thing as, if we take the four, that's the same thing as four plus four fifths, four plus four fifths and four is the same thing as 20 fifths, so 4 is the same thing as 20 fifths and then plus four fifths, well, what are you going to get? Your going to get, you add the numerators, you get 24 fifths, 24 fifths, another way to think about it is take this denominator, take the fifths, multiply by four, you get 20 fifths, plus the four fifths that you already have is 24 fifths and so this is the same things as 24 fifths divided by, use the same idea, one and a half is the same thing as one plus one half, one is the same thing as two halves plus one half and so that's going to be, add the numerators, that's going to be three halves, so just like this, we're able to rewrite our expression as 24 fifths divided by three halves and now the key realization is is that that is the same thing as 24 fifths times the reciprocal of three halves, so times, pause the video, what's the reciprocal of three halves? Well, the reciprocal of three halves, you just swap the numerator and the denominator, it's going to be two over three, now what is this going to be? Well, there's a couple of ways to do it, you could just straight up multiply the numerators and you would get 48 and then multiply the denominators and you would get 15, so you get 48 over 15, but you might be able to rewrite that in sometimes what's called a more simplified way, but another way of thinking about this is you could just say, well this is the same thing as 24 times two, times two over five times three and simplify things, before you even multiply them out, five times five times three and you realize that look, 24 and three are both divisible by three, so let me divide them both by three, so 24 divided by three is eight and three divided by three is equal to one and then you could multiply the numerators and the denominators and so, and so you get in the numerator, eight times two is 16, in the denominator, you get a five, so you get 16 fifths and then if you wanna express that as a mixed number, 16 over five, well, five goes into 16 three times with one left over, so this is three and one fifth and one thing to appreciate, right over here, I simplified that the 24 and the three of this step, sometimes you'll see people simplifying at this step, so they'll say, hey look, eventually I'm gonna have a 24 in the numerator and a three in the denominator, so let me divide both of those by three, so they'll say 24 divided by three is eight and then three divided by three is one and this is sometimes called a cross reduction, but this is all that's going on right over here.",math_6th-engage-ny_engage-6th-module-2
" -  You often hear the phrase like dissolves like when you're talking about solubility and even though this idea isn't perfect, it does allow you to predict the solubility of compounds. For example, a polar solvent will dissolve a polar compound in general, so like dissolves like. I also have here a polar solvent will dissolve in ionic solute because you don't usually describe ionic compounds as being polar. Next, a nonpolar solvent will dissolve a nonpolar compound, so like dissolves like, but a polar solvent will not dissolve a nonpolar compound, so this would be like and unlike here. An example of a polar solvent is water. An example of a nonpolar compound could be something like oil. We know that water will not dissolve oil. Let's go back to this first idea of a polar solvent being able to dissolve a polar compound or a polar solvent dissolving an ionic compound like sodium chloride. We know from experience that sodium chloride, or salt, is soluble in water. Over here on the left we have part of a salt crystal. We know that crystals are held together by attractive forces, the positively charged sodium cation is attracted to the negatively charged chloride anion. Opposite charges attract and our crystal is held together by these attracted forces. If we get some water molecules to come along, we know that water is a polar solvent, water is a polar molecule. The oxygen is more electronegative than this hydrogen, so the oxygen pulls some of the electron density in this bond closer to it giving it a partial negative charge. If we are withdrawing electron density from this hydrogen, this hydrogen gets a partial positive charge. Since opposite charges attract, the partially positive hydrogen in water is attracted to the negatively charged chloride anion, so there's an interaction here. If we get a bunch of water molecules, here's another one right here, so partially negative oxygen, partially positive hydrogen, so there's another attractive force. We can pull off these chloride anions from the solid and bring the anion into solution. On the right here we have our chloride anion in solution surrounded by a bunch of water molecules and we have all these partially positive hydrogens interacting with our negatively charged chloride anion. For the sodium cations let's go back to our solid on the left. Since the sodium cation is positively charged, that's going to interact with the partially negatively charged oxygen in the water molecule, so opposite charges attract and if you get enough water molecules you can pull off these sodium cations and bring the sodium cations into a solution. We have the partially negative oxygens on water interacting with our positively charged sodium cations in our solution. Our polar solvent, water, needs to be able to interact with our solutes and in this case the polar solvent attacks the solid over here on the left and it replaces these ion interactions of our crystal with ion-dipole interactions in our solution. By ion-dipole, I mean we have a cation right here, so that's our ion and then our di-pole would be water, water's a polar molecule, it has di-pole moment, so we have all of these ion di-pole interactions. Ionic solutes that are able to participate in these interactions will dissolve in water. If you have a polar compound, right, a similar idea, you have attractive forces that allow the polar compounds to be dissolved in a polar solvent like water. Let's move on to a nonpolar compound, so a nonpolar compound, something like this molecule on the left here and this molecule's called naphthalene. Naphthalene is a solid with a very distinctive smell to it. The first time I smelled naphthalene in the lab it reminded me of my grandparents' house because my grandparents, when I was a kid, had mothballs that were made of naphthalene, so it's a very distinctive smell. Now naphthalene is nonpolar because it's composed of only carbons and hydrogens, it's a hydrocarbon, so naphthalene is nonpolar and you would need a nonpolar solvent to get it to dissolve. Toluene is a nonpolar solvent, again, this is a hydrocarbon, so if you take solid naphthalene and liquid toluene, naphthalene will dissolve in toluene, so like dissolves like, our nonpolar solvent will dissolve our nonpolar compound. Finally, let's look at this last idea here, so a polar solvent, something like water, should not dissolve a nonpolar compound, something like naphthalene, and that's true, naphthalene will not dissolve in water, so water doesn't interact well enough with the naphthalene molecules to get them to dissolve and form a solution. This concept of like dissolves like is important because it allows you to predict whether or not a compound will be soluble in water. Let's look at several organic compounds and determine whether or not those compounds are soluble in water. We'll start with ethanol. Ethanol has a polar oxygen-hydrogen bond, the oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the oxygen withdraws some electron density making the oxygen partially negative and leaving the hydrogen partially positive. If water comes along, I'll draw in a water molecule here, and we know that water is a polar solvent, water is a polar molecule, the oxygen has a partial negative and the hydrogens have partial positive charges. We can see that there's an opportunity for an attractive force, opposite charges attract, so the partially positive hydrogen on ethanol is attracted to the partially negatively charged oxygen on water. This is an example of hydrogen bond density, remember hydrogen bonding from earlier videos. Here is a good example of that. We can even have some more hydrogen bonding, I could draw in another water molecule down here, so let me go ahead and do that, we know that the oxygen is partially negative, hydrogens are partially positive, so here's another opportunity for hydrogen bonding between partially negative oxygen on ethanol and the partially positive hydrogen on water. This portion of the ethanol molecule is polar and loves water, so this is the polar region and this portion loves water, we call this hydrophilic, so let me write that down here so this portion of the molecule is hydrophilic, or water loving. Let's look at the other portion of the ethanol molecule, so this portion on the left. We have a CH2 here and a CH3 here, so carbons and hydrogens which we know are nonpolar, so this region is nonpolar, this region doesn't like water, it's scared of water, we call this hydrophobic, or water fearing. We know that ethanol is soluble in water just by experience, so that must mean this hydrophobic region doesn't overcome the hydrophilic region, so the hydrophilic region is polar region of the ethanol molecule, it's enough to make ethanol soluble in water. If you think about that same concept and look at a different molecule, so on the right here's 1-octanol. 1-octanol has an opportunity for hydrogen bonding we have this OH here, so it's the same situation as the ethanol on the left, so we have a polar or hydrophilic region of the molecule. However, the difference is this time we have extremely large nonpolar hydrophobic portion of the molecule. This nonpolar region overcomes the slightly polar region making the 1-octanol molecule nonpolar overall, so 1-octanol will not dissolve in water. This one is a no and this one over here was a yes, ethanol is a yes. Next, let's look at cinnamaldehyde, so down here on the left is cinnamaldehyde, let's focus in on, let's focus in on this carbon oxygen double bond first. We know that oxygen is more electronegative than this carbon here, so the oxygen withdraws from the electron density making it partially negative and this carbon would be there for partially positive. This very small portion of the molecule is polar, this small portion could interact with water. However, we have an extremely large, nonpolar region of the molecule, all of these carbons and hydrogens over here on the left. This very hydrophobic region, or nonpolar region, overcomes the small polar region making cinnamaldehyde overall nonpolar. Since it's overall nonpolar, cinnamaldehyde will not dissolve in water. If it's nonpolar, you would need a more nonpolar solvent to get cinnamaldehyde to dissolve and there are several examples of nonpolar organic solvents that will do that. Next let's look at sucrose, so over here on the right is sucrose or one way to draw or represent the sucrose compound. Now we see lots of carbons and hydrogens, so all of these right here, let me just go ahead and highlight all these carbons in this ring and so all these carbons in these rings, all these hydrogens, so at first you might think okay, there's lots of carbons and hydrogens, this might be nonpolar, but of course we have lots of these OH groups, so I'm gonna go ahead and circle a few of them, right, we have all of these OH groups 1in the sucrose molecules, so lots of them. 1That means opportunities for hydrogen bonding. 1Because of all these opportunities 1for hydrogen bonding, sucrose is soluble in water 1which we know from experience. 1Of course sucrose, or sugar, sugar will 1dissolve in water, so the opportunity 1for hydrogen bonding is the reason for that. 1Benzoic acid is a solid at room temperature. 1If you take some benzoic acid crystals 1and you put them in some room temperature water, 1the crystals won't dissolve. 1We can explain that by looking 1at the structure for benzoic acid. 1While we do have this portion of the compound 1which we know is polar and hydrophilic 1due to the presence of the electronegative oxygens, 1we also have this portion of the compound 1on the left which is nonpolar and hydrophobic 1due to the presence of all the carbons and hydrogens. 1Since the benzoic acid crystals don't 1dissolve at room temperature water, 1the hydrophobic portion of the compound 1must overcome the hydrophilic portion of the compound. 1You actually can get benzoic acid 1crystals to dissolve in water if you heat up the water, 1if you increase the solubility of the compound 1by increasing the temperature of the solvent. 1Let's think about benzoic acid crystals 1in room temperature water and let's add a base, 1let's add sodium hydroxide. 1The sodium hydroxide's going to react 1with the most acidic proton on benzoic acid, 1so benzoic acid is acidic, it will 1donate this proton right here. 1That means the electrons in red in this bond 1are left behind on the oxygen, 1so I'll show those electrons in red over here. 1That's gives this oxygen a negative charge 1and we form sodium benzoate. 1I won't get too much into acid base chemistry, 1but we took the most acidic proton off of benzoic acid 1to give us the conjugate base sodium benzoate. 1Sodium benzoate is highly soluble 1in room temperature water. 1That must mean we increase this 1hydrophilic portion because now we have 1a negative charge, so the hydrophilic portion 1now is able to overcome the hydrophobic portion. 1Sodium benzoate is soluble, 1this negative charge is better able 1to interact with our solvent which is water.",science_organic-chemistry_gen-chem-review
" Let's say that I have five lemons so that's [counting to five] ... five lemons and I were to ask you: what do I have to multiply times five to get one? or in this case: what do I have to multiply times five lemons to get one lemon? and so, another question you might ask because really multiplication and division are two sides of the same coin is what do I have to divide five by to get to one lemon or yellow circle, or whatever I have drawn right over here Well, if you have five things and you divide by five, you're gonna have five groups of one so if you divide by five, you're gonna have [counting to five] ... five groups So you could say five divided by five is equal to one take five things and divide it into five groups then each group is going to have one in them or you could say five times one fifth is equal to one (and I use the dot for multiplication) I could also say five times one fifth is equal to one these are all really saying the same thing Maybe what's kind of interesting here (although it's not some huge learning) it's really just another way of writing what you already probably know, is this idea that if I have a number and I multiply times it's multiplicative inverse (and most of the time when people talk about inverses in mathematics they are talking about the multiplicative inverse) then I'm going to get one so five time one fifth is equal to one but that's just because five times one fifth is the same thing as five divided by five if you were to actually multiply this out you actually take five times one fifth this is equal to five-over-one times one-over-five you multiply the numerators: five times one is five multiply the denominators: one times five is five so you have five fifths, and five fifths is the exact same thing as one So if someone where to ask you a question, they say ""Hey, I have the number 217 and I want to multiply it by something, and I want to get one after multiplying it by that something"" Well then you say - Well look, If I took 217 and divided it by 217 that would get me to one and dividing by 217 is the exact same thing as multiplying by one-over-217 multiplying by its multiplicative inverse which is, once again, a word that is fancier than the actual concept you are just multiplying by the inverse of this number Another way to think about it is if I have five things and I take one fifth of those things, how many things do I have? Well, if I take one fifth of five things I have exactly one thing right over here But the general idea is super-duper-duper simple if I have some crazy number ... 8,345 that's actually not so crazy, let's turn it to something in the millions ... and 271 ... so 8,345,271 And I say, what do I have to multiply by (and now I use this multiplication symbol right now) what do I have to multiply that by in order to get one?

"  Let's say that you have two folks that are trying to collectively push a box across the snow towards a target, so this is where the box is, right over here and this is the target, right over here. Let me write that, that is the target. That's where they're trying to get the box, and person A, because for some reason, they can't push it from exactly behind the box, maybe there's not a good footing there, or I guess if they pressed there, maybe the box squeezes a little bit, so person A has to push in a direction that's not exactly going in the direction of the target, so they push in a direction that looks like this, and so let me show you this vector I'm drawing, essentially represents the force that they're exerting. This is their force vector. This is person A's force vector. So this is person A's force vector, and we know the length of this vector, or another way to think about it, the magnitude of vector A is 330 newtons, 330 newtons. And let's say person B, once again, because they can't push exactly in the direction of the target, maybe the box is really soft right over here, person B is pushing at this angle right over here, so that right over there, that vector is the force that person B is pushing onto it and the direction, and the magnitude of that force, of that vector of person B's pushing, is 300 newtons. And we know their angles that those make with the direction of the target. So if this is the direction of the target right over here we know that this is a 35 degree angle, and we know that this is a 15 degree angle. Now what I want you to do, is pause this video and think about how much of each of their force is going in the direction of getting the box towards the target, and then who is actually exerting more force in that direction. We see that person A is exerting a total, a higher magnitude of force in this direction than person B is doing in that direction. 330 newtons versus 300, but who's helping the box go more in that direction? And by how much more? And also, what's the total force now pushing the box in that direction? So I'm assuming you had a go at it, and the key here is to find the component of each of these vectors, the magnitude of each of these vectors in this direction, in the direction towards the target. And so, let's look first at vector A. So vector A looks like this, and I'll just draw them separately just so we can clean it up a little bit. Vector A looks like this. We know its magnitude - the magnitude of vector A is equal to 330 newtons, and if we say that the target is in this direction right over here, so that's the target is some place out here, we've already been told that this is 35 degrees. So what we really want to do is find the component, the magnitude of the component going in that direction right over there. The way we can do that is just with our traditional trig functions. This right over here is a right triangle. We are looking for this side right over here. We have - let me just call that A sub X. And we already know that the magnitude of A is 330 newtons, so the magnitude - let me just say that the magnitude - let me just write it this way so we don't confuse. So let's just say the magnitude of the vector in the X direction, so this vector right over here, we can write like this. The magnitude of that, we'll just write it without the vector notation. So how can we think about that? Well we know cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse, so we could write cosine of 35 degrees is equal to the length of the adjacent side. That would just be A sub X, without the vector over it. We're just saying that that's the magnitude of vector A sub X, over the magnitude of vector A, over 330 newtons, or we could say that A sub X is equal to 330 times the cosine of 35 degrees. And we can make the exact same argument for B. Vector B, so let me draw it like this. Vector B, you could, maybe I'll draw it like this just to make it a little bit - let me do it a little bit different. If this is the direction to the target, so once again, I'll just draw a horizontal line for that. Then relative to that, vector B looks something like this. Vector B looks something like that, so that is vector B. B sub X, in the direction of the target - so we would drop a perpendicular like that. This would be - this right over here would be the vector B sub X, and so what is the magnitude of B sub X going to be equal to? Now we could say that the magnitude of B sub X - we'll just call that B sub X without the vector notation, same exact logic. This is 15 degrees. Cosine of 15 degrees is going to be the length of the adjacent side over the length of the hypotenuse. So we already know that the length of the hypotenuse is 300 newtons. So we could write that cosine of 15 degrees is equal to B sub X, length of the adjacent side over the length of the hypotenuse. Or that B sub X is equal to 300 times cosine of 15 degrees. So let's get our calculator out and let's calculate what these things are. So, let's see, we have 330 times cosine of 35 degrees, gets us to 270 newtons. So that's A sub X is 270 newtons, and B sub X is 300 times cosine of 15 degrees. We get 289.777, so what we see is, even though B's magnitude is less than A's magnitude, the component of vector B going the direction of the target is actually larger than the component of vector A going in it. So if we were rounding to the nearest newton, this right over here, the magnitude of this vector right over here, B sub X, that is, if we round to the nearest newton, 290 newtons. So this is approximately 290 newtons length, or I guess you could say magnitude, while this one is a little bit shorter - it's a little bit shorter. We saw if we round to the nearest newton, it's about 270 newtons. The length of this one is 270 newtons, approximately. So if you were to say, how much more is person B pushing in the direction that we care about, it's about - well, if we want to be a little more precise, we can subtract the two, so we can take 300 cosine of 15, minus 330 cosine of 35, and we get about 19.5 newtons difference. The blue, person B, is contributing 19.458 newtons more in that direction towards the target than person A is. But if we wanted to talk about, what is the total force going in that direction, then we would take the sum of these two things. So we would - the total force in that direction is going to be 560 newtons if we round to the nearest newton. So if you add this blue component to this magenta component, you get this one right over here, which is 560 newtons. So this whole vector right over here, it's magnitude - so I could write that as the magnitude of A sub X, plus B sub X, which is the same thing as A sub X, plus B sub X - I already said these are the equivalent of the magnitude of each of these vectors is equal to - I could write approximately equal 560 newtons.",math_algebra-home_alg-vectors
" -  Let's say we're trying to understand the relationship between people's height and their weight. So what we do is we go to 10 different people, and we measure each of their heights and each of their weights. And so on this scatter plot here, each dot represents a person. So, for example, this dot over here represents a person whose height was 60 inches, or five feet tall. So that's the point 60 comma, and whose weight, which we have on the y-axis, was 125 pounds. And so when you look at this scatter plot, your eyes naturally see some type of a trend. It seems like, generally speaking, as height increases, weight increases as well. But I said generally speaking. You definitely have circumstances where there are taller people who might weigh less. But an interesting question is can we try to fit a line to this data? And this idea of trying to fit a line as closely as possible to as many of the points as possible is known as linear, linear regression. Now, the most common technique is to try to fit a line that minimizes the squared distance to each of those points, and we're gonna talk more about that in future videos. But for now, we want to get an intuitive feel for that. So if you were to just eyeball it and look at a line like that, you wouldn't think that it would be a particularly good fit. It looks like most of the data sits above the line. Similarly, something like this also doesn't look that great. Here most of our data points are sitting below the line. But something like this actually looks very good. It looks like it's getting as close as possible to as many of the points as possible. It seems like it's describing this general trend. And so this is the actual regression line. And the equation here, we would write as, we'd write y with a little hat over it. And that means that we're trying to estimate a y for a given x. It's not always going to be the actual y for a given x. Because, as we see, sometimes the points aren't sitting on the line. But we say y hat is equal to, and our y-intercept, for this particular regression line, it is negative 140 plus the slope 14 over three times x. Now, as we can see, for most of these points, given the x-value of those points, the estimate that our regression line gives is different than the actual value. And that difference between the actual and the estimate from the regression line is known as the residual. So let me write that down. So, for example, the residual at that point, residual at that point is going to be equal to, for a given x, the actual y-value minus the estimated y-value from the regression line for that same x. Or another way to think about it is, for that x-value, when x is equal to 60, we're talking about the residual just at that point, it's going to be the actual y-value minus our estimate of what the y-value is from this regression line for that x-value. So pause this video, and see if you can calculate this residual. And you could visually imagine it as being this right over here. Well, to actually calculate the residual, you would take our actual value, which is 125, for that x-value. Remember, we're calculating the residual for a point. So it's the actual y there minus, what would be the estimated y there for that x-value? Well, we could just go to this equation and say what would y hat be when x is equal to 60? Well, it's going to be equal to, let's see, we have negative 140 plus 14 over three times 60. Let's see, 60 divided by three is 20. 20 times 14 is 280. And so all of this is going to be 140. And so our residual, for this point, is going to be 125 minus 140, which is negative 15. And residuals indeed can be negative. If your residual is negative, it means, for that x-value, your data point, your actual y-value, is below the estimate. If we were to calculate the residual here or if we were to calculate the residual here, our actual for that x-value is above our estimate, so we would get positive residuals. And as you will see later in your statistics career, the way that we calculate these regression lines is all about minimizing the square of these residuals.",math_ap-statistics_bivariate-data-ap
" We've already used a transformation matrix to transform one point, what I want to do in this video, is transform a series of points. So, I have these position vectors, p1, p2, and p3, and I've plotted them right over here. And you can imagine them to even be vertices of a triangle that looks something like this (that's one side, that's another side, and that's another side, right like that) and what I'm curious about is what happens if I transform these three points? And like the last video, I could apply this transformation matrix separately to each of them to see what they transform into, or instead I could take this transformation matrix, and multiply it times a matrix composed of these position vectors, so let me do that... Let me take my transformation matrix, let me copy and paste that. So, copy and paste. So, I'm going to take my transformation matrix and I am going to multiply that by a matrix that has all three of these position vectors in it, where each of the columns of this matrix is going to be one of these position vectors. So, the first one is 2, 1. Then we have -2, 0 Then we have 0, 2. So, one way you could think about it is we're taking our transformation matrix and we're multiplying it by a matrix that is composed of the first column is position vector 1, the second column is position vector 2, and the third column is position vector 3. Now, what is this going to give us? Well, this is a 2x2 matrix. We're multiplying it by a 2x3 matrix, so matrix multiplication is defined over here because the number of columns here is the same as the number of rows here. And it's going to result in a 2x3 matrix. So, it's going to result in a 2x3 matrix. So, 2 rows and 3 columns, which we could imagine represents three new position vectors. So, what's this going to be? Let's go step by step. So, this first entry, first row, first column, is this row times this column, so 2x2 which is 4, plus 1 plus 1, so it's 4 plus 1 so this is going to be 5. Let me do it in a different color. -1 times 2 is -2. plus 2 times 1 plus 2, that's -2 plus 2 which is 0. So, we already see it transformed 2,1 to 5,0. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So if we consider this p1, we consider this p1 prime, p1 after our transformation. Now, let's go to p2. 2 times -2 is -4, plus 1 times 0, so it's -4 plus 0, which is just -4. And then -1 times 2 is positive 2, plus 2 times 0, which is just going to be 0. So it's going to be positive 2 plus 0, which is just 2. So, -4, 2. Negative 1, 2, 3, 4 comma 2. Right over here. So this is p2 This was p2 right over here. This is p2 prime. This is position vector p2 prime. Or the position that position vector p2 prime would specify. And then finally, let's look at p3. So we have 2 times 0, which is 0, plus 1 times 2, so that's zero plus 2 or just 2, and then we have -1 times 0, which is 0. plus 2 times 2 is four. So, we get the point 2, 4. So, 2 comma 1, 2, 3, 4... we go right over here. So, this is p3 right over here. This is p3 prime. And so something interesting has happened. We now have the vertices you could imagine of a new triangle. Of a new triangle that looks something like this. That looks something like this. So, what you can imagine is... Actually, let me draw it... Let me draw our new one with this blue color. so we can see it a little better. So we went from that smaller triangle, we went from that smaller triangle to the larger one, this is the smaller one right over here. That's our smaller triangle to the larger one, or another way you could think of it, this entire triangle was transformed, and right now we only transformed the vertices, but it actually turns out, and I'm not proving this video, that if you transformed- if you took any of these points on this triangle, it would have transformed to a corresponding point on this larger triangle. And what's neat about this is hopefully you're starting to appreciate the power of a transformation matrix. And hopefully you're starting to appreciate why this is useful as you start to think about things like computer games and animation, because what transformation matrixes allow us to do, and this is what these computer programs allow us to do - view things from different perspectives, what they're actually doing under the covers, is they're using transformation matrixes, and they're multiplying them times coordinates, in order to get new coordinates based on the position or the perspective of the player, or the position or the perspective of the camera, or the virtual camera in a computer graphics world. So two, I guess, several neat things here, is we haven't just transformed a point now, we've transformed three points, which could represent the vertices of a triangle, and you see it as this kind of expansion and rotation that seems to have happened when we used this transformation matrix. If we use a different transformation matrix, we would have a different transformation and not only did we do it, but we saw that we could do it with multiple position vectors as the same time. I could have done it independently and gotten the same result, but this is hopefully starting to show you the power of matrixes, and why it also could be useful in things like computer graphics and animation and things like that.",math_precalculus_matrices
" You can never have too much practice dealing with the normal distribution, because it's really one of those super important building blocks for the rest of statistics and really a lot of your life. So what I've done is I've taken some sample problems. This is from ck12.org Open Source flex book, their AP Statistics flex book. And I've taken the problems from their normal distribution chapter. So you could go to their site and actually look up these same problems. So this first problem, which of the following data sets is most likely to be normally distributed? For the other choices, explain why you believe they would not follow a normal distribution. So it's a choice. So this is my beliefs come into play. So this is unusual in the math context. It's more of a, what do I think? It's kind of an essay question. So let's see what they have here. A, the hand span. Measured from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the extended fifth finger. So I think they're talking about, let me see if I can draw a hand. So that's the index finger. And then you got the middle finger. And then you got your ring finger. And you got your pinky. And the hand will look something like that. I think they're talking about this distance. From the tip of the thumb to the tip of the extended fifth finger, which is a fancy way of saying the pinky, I think. They're talking about that distance right there. And they're saying, if I were to measure it of a random sample of high school seniors, what would it look like? Well, you know how far this is. This is a combination of genetics and environmental factors, maybe how much milk you drank or how much you hung from your pinky from a bar while you were growing up. So I would think that it is a sum of a huge number of random processes. So I would guess that it is roughly, normally distributed. You know, if I look at my own hand, and my hand I don't think has grown much since I was a high school senior. It looks like roughly nine inches or so. I play guitar. Maybe that helped me stretch my hand. But it's really an essay question, so I just have to say what I feel. So I would guess that the distribution would look something like this. I don't know. I've never done this. But maybe it has a mean of eight inches or nine inches and is distributed something like this. It's distributed something like that. So maybe it probably does look like a normal distribution. But probably won't be a perfect, in fact, I can guarantee you it won't be a perfect normal distribution. Because one, no one can have negative length of that span. This distance could never be negative. So they're going to have, I guess you could have no hand so that would maybe be counted as 0. But the distribution wouldn't go into the negative domain. So it wouldn't be a perfect normal distribution on the left hand side. It would really just end here at 0. And even on the right hand side, there is some physically impossible hand lengths. No one can have a hand that's larger than the height of the atmosphere or an astronomical unit. You would you start touching the sun. There's some point, which is physically impossible to get to. And in a true normal distribution, if I were to flip a bunch of coins there's some very, very small probability that I could get a million heads in a row. It's almost 0. But there's some probability. But in the case of hand span, there's no way out here, you know, the probability of human being who happens to be a high school senior, having a one-mile length hand span, that's 0. So it's not going to be a perfect normal distribution of the outliers or as we get further and further away from the mean. But I think it'll be a pretty good, in our everyday world as good as we're going to get, approximation. The normal distribution is going to be a pretty good approximation for the distribution that we see. And I guess one thing that you know-- It's funny. This is high school seniors, when I did this, it was kind of from my point of view as a guy. And I would argue that high school seniors, guys, probably have larger hands than women. So it's possible you actually have a bimodal distribution. So instead of having it like this, it's possible that the distribution looks like this. That you have one peak for guys, maybe at eight inches. And then maybe a peak for women at seven inches. And then the distribution falls off like that. So it's also possible it could be bimodal. But in general, a normal distribution is going to be a pretty good approximation for part A of this problem. Let's see what part B, what they're asking us to describe. The annual salaries of all employees of a large shipping company. So if we're talking about annual salaries, we have minimum wage laws whatnot. so I would guess that any corporation, if we're talking about full time workers at least, there's going to be some minimum salary that people have. So I would say, and probably a lot of people will have that minimum salary because it'll be probably the most labor intensive jobs, you probably have most people down there at the low end of the scale. And then you have your different middle level managers and whatnot. And then you probably have this big gap. And then you probably have your true executives, maybe your CEO or whatnot. If this mean, right here, is maybe $40,000 a year and this is probably $80,000 where some of the mid-level managers lie. But this out here, this will probably be-- Actually if you were to draw it real, the way I've scaled it right now, this would be about $200,00, which is actually a reasonable salary for a CEO. But the reality is, is that this actually might get pushed way out from there. It might look something like that. It might be way off the chart. Let's say the CEO made $5 million in a year because he cashed in a bunch of options or something. So it would be way over here. And maybe it's a CEO and a couple of other people, the CFO or the founders. So my guess is it definitely wouldn't be a normal distribution. And it would be bimodal. You would have another peak over here for senior management. Well, if we were maybe in Europe, this would be closer to the left. But it won't be a perfect normal distribution. And you're not going to have any values below a certain threshold, below that kind of minimum wage level. So I would call this, when you have a tail that goes more to the right than to the left, a right skewed distribution. Since it has two humps right here, one there, and one there. We can also says it bimodal. I mean, it depends on what kind of company this is. But that would be my guess of a lot of large shipping company's salaries. Let's look at choice C or problem part C. The annual salaries of a random sample of 50 CEOs of major companies, 25 women and 25 men. The fact that they wrote this year, I think they maybe are implying that maybe men and women, the gender gap has not been closed fully, and there is some discrepancy. So if I was just purely 50 CEOs of major companies, I would say it's probably close to a normal distribution. It's probably something like, once again, there's going to be some level below which no CEO is willing to work for, although you have heard of some cases where they work for free. But they're really getting paid in other ways. If you include all of those things, there's probably some base salary that all CEOs make at least that much. And then it goes up to some value, the highest probability value. And then it probably has a long tail to the right. And this is if there were no gender gap. So this would just be a purely right skewed distribution where you have a long tail to the right. Now, if you assume that there's some gender gap, then you might have two humps here, which would be a bimodal distribution. So if you assume there's some gender gap, this is part C right here, then maybe there's one hump for women. And if you assume that women earn less than men, then another hump for men. And there are 25 of each so there wouldn't necessarily more men than women. And then it would skew all the way off to the right. And in fact, I think there would probably be chance that you have this other notion here where you have these super CEOs, or mega CEOs who make millions, while most CEOs probably just make, I'll put it in quotation marks, ""a few hundred thousand dollars"" while there's a small subset that are way off many standard deviations to the right. So it could even be a trimodal distribution here. So that's choice C. And then so far, choice A looks like the best candidate for a pure, or the closest to being a normal distribution. Let's see what D is. The date of 100 pennies taken from a cash drawer in a convenience store. 100 pennies. So that's actually an interesting experiment. But I would guess, and once again, this is really a question where I get to express my feelings about these things. As long as your answer is reasonable, I would say that it is right. Most pennies are newer pennies. Because they go out of commission. They get traded out. They get worn out as they age. They get lost, or they get pressed at the little tourist place into those little souvenir things. I'm not even sure if that's legal, if you could do that the money legally. So my guess is that if you were to plot it, you would have a ton of pennies that are, within the last few years, So the date of 100 pennies, not their age, so the dates, so if this is 2010, I would guess that right now, you're not going to find any 2010 pennies. But you're probably going to find a ton of 2009 pennies. And then it probably just goes down from there. And of course, you're not going to find pennies that are older than the United States or before they even started printing pennies. So it's obvious this tail isn't going to go to the left forever. But my guess is you're going to have a left skewed distribution. Where you have the bulk of the distribution on the right, but the tail goes off to the left. That's why it's called a left skewed distribution. Sometimes this is called a negatively skewed distribution. And similarly, this right skewed distribution, or this right you distribution, sometimes is called positively skewed. And if you have only one hump. You don't have a multimodal distribution like this, 1in a left skewed distribution, your mean 1is going to be to the left of your median. 1So in this case, maybe your median 1might be someplace over here. 1But since you have this long tail to the left, 1your mean might be someplace over here. 1And likewise, in this distribution, 1your median, your middle value, might be some place like this. 1But because it's right skewed, and for the most part only 1has one big hump. 1this hump won't change things too much because it's small, 1your mean is going to be to the right of it. 1So that's another reason why it's 1called a right skewed or positively skewed distribution. 1So to answer the question, you know, 1these are my feelings about all of them. 1But I would say-- the other choices 1explain why you believe they would not follow-- 1or they said, which of the following data sets 1is most likely to be normally distributed. 1Well, I would say choice A. But it's really 1a matter of opinion, at least in this question.",math_ap-statistics_density-curves-normal-distribution-ap
" In a regular tetrahedron-- and that's just a four-sided polyhedron, and its regular, so all of the sides and all of the faces will be the same-- the centers of the four faces are the vertices of a smaller tetrahedron. The ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to that of the larger is m over n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m plus n. So let's just draw this regular tetrahedron first. So this is a regular tetrahedron. So in order to have four equal sides, or four equals faces, I should say, in three dimensions, it needs to look like this. It essentially needs to be four triangles. So we have one triangle, just like that. Then we have another triangle like that. Then we have another triangle in the back. So this is another triangle in the back. And then we have a triangle as a base. This is a regular tetrahedron, where each of these faces are going to be equilateral triangles. Each of these faces are equilateral triangles. So if you looked, this length is the same as that length, this is the same as that length. Fair enough. So that's our regular tetrahedron. Now, they say the centers of the four faces, so let's look at the centers of the four faces. Let's say that this is the center of one face. This is the center of another face. Back here is the center of the face that we can't see that's behind these two faces. And then this is the center, this right here, let's say, is the center of the base. The center of the four faces are the vertices of a smaller tetrahedron, so we could connect them and get a smaller tetrahedron. So along, so we have this one going from the center of this face to the center of the base. Going from the center of the base to the center of this face over here, we have this line. You connect those, we have one of the faces of the smaller tetrahedron. You go like that, you have kind of the top. If you flipped it over, it would be the base, but you'd have the top of the smaller tetrahedron. And then if you connected those in the back, you would have the two faces that you can't see-- that face and that face. Now, they want us to essentially figure out the volume of the smaller tetrahedron, this magenta tetrahedron, to this yellow one over here. And you might already be wrecking your brain, how do you figure out the volume of a tetrahedron and whatnot, and all of that. But the important thing to realize if you take two similar objects and if you just know the ratio of one of their dimensions, and assuming that all of their dimensions have the same ratio-- and it is the case in this right over here-- then the volume will be the cube of the ratios of one of their sides. So let me show this to you right over here. Let me depict it. So let's say that this length right over here, let's call that Length Big for the big tetrahedron. And let's find the corresponding edge of the small tetrahedron. So let's say that we have another side of the small tetrahedron, let's call that Length Small. If we know the ratio of Length Big to Length Small, we can figure out the ratio of the big tetrahedron to the small tetrahedron, the volume of the big tetrahedron to the volume of the small tetrahedron by just cubing this ratio. And we can do that because these are completely similar in every direction, in every dimension. Whatever the ratio of this is to this is the same as the ratio of that is to that. And actually, all of these sides are the same, so all of these sides are going to be the same as well. So they're similar in every dimension. So with that said, we really just need to figure out the ratio of one of the sides of the big tetrahedron to the length of the side of a small tetrahedron. And to do that, let's just put ourselves-- And there are more elegant ways of doing it, but those get a little bit more abstract. What I'm going to do is just try to figure out some coordinates of some of these vertices of the larger tetrahedron. And from that we can take the average of the coordinates to find the coordinates of these vertices, the centres of the faces. So let me draw some coordinate axes here. So let's say that this is my y-axis. I'm going to try to draw it so that we can visualize it in three dimensions. So let's say that is my y-axis. Let's make my x-axis do something like this. So let's say that is the x-axis. And then you're going to have your z-axis go straight up and down. And actually, I won't draw that yet. What I want to just draw right now is the base of the larger tetrahedron. And I'm going to do that. I'm just going to pick arbitrary coordinates here. We really just care about the ratios, so we can pick the larger tetrahedron and have any size. So let's say that that vertex right over here is sitting right over here. This vertex sits right over here. And then this vertex right over here sit right over there. And then let's assign-- we'll make it so that looks a little bit better. And so this is the base. of our tetrahedron, of our big one. It's an equilateral triangle-- all the sides are the same. And just for simplicity of the coordinates, let's make this coordinate right over here, let's say that x is equal to 1, y is clearly equal to 0, because we are on the x-axis, we haven't moved in the y direction. And then we haven't even paid any attention to z, but it's clearly sitting in the xy-plane, so z is also going to be equal to 0. If we go over here, let's make this negative 1, comma 0, comma 0. So it's still on the x-axis. So this distance right over here is 1, this distance over here is 1, this entire side is 2. So we also know that this entire side over here is going to be 2. And you could use 30-60-90 triangles to figure out this distance, which we need to figure out the y-coordinate here. Let me be very clear. This, the coordinate of this point over here, x is clearly equal to 0 over here. X is 0. z is clearly equal to 0, we're still in the xy-plane. But we don't know what the y-coordinate is. So we're going to have to do a little bit of-- well, you could use your knowledge of 30-60-90 triangles or if you don't even want to do that, you can just go straight to the Pythagorean theorem. We're looking for the y-coordinate over here. We're looking for this distance right over here. So this y-coordinate squared plus 1 squared is going to equal 2 squared. So let me write that over here. So this-- I will do a new color-- so the y-coordinate squared plus 1 squared-- so plus 1 is going to be equal to 2 squared, it's going to be equal to 4, where this is the y-coordinate. So y squared is going to be equal to 3. y is going to be equal to the square root of 3. So this distance right over here is the square root of 3. Or so I could write square root of 3 here-- you could see that this satisfies the Pythagorean theorem-- or I could just put its coordinate-- it's coordinate is square root of 3 in the y-direction. Now, while we're focusing on the base on the base of the large tetrahedron, we can right now figure out the center of that base, figure out the center of that face, which maybe might sit right about here. And the easy way to figure out the center of this face is literally just to average of the coordinates. So the coordinate for this character right over here is going to be the average of the x's. So 0 plus 1 minus 1 is 0 divided by 3 is just going to be 0, which is very clear. It's sitting on the y-axis. It does not move in the x x-direction, either to the right or to the left. The y-coordinate, we're going to have square root of 3 plus 0 plus 0 over 3. So that's just going to be square root of 3 over 3. So it's one third of the way all the way to the top of the base. And then the z-coordinate coordinate, you could take the average, but it's clearly still sitting on the xy-plane. So it's also going to be 0. You can take 0 plus 0 plus 0 divided by 3-- clearly still 0. So we figured out also one of the vertices of our smaller tetrahedron. What I want to do now to try to figure out the coordinates of this vertex right here. Then we can figure out this distance, compare it to a distance of 2, and then, essentially, take the cube of it, and we'll have the ratio we need. And then we can figure out the rest of the problem-- the m plus n. Now, to figure out the coordinates here, we need to take the average of this coordinate, this coordinate, and this coordinate up here. We know these two coordinates. We know these two coordinates. We just need to figure out this coordinate up here. And to do that, let's now extend into the z-direction. So if we were to go straight up from this point. So if we were to go straight up from that center point, 1we just figured out. 1Let's say we go right. 1I could draw a neater altitude than that. 1So let's say I were to go straight up from this point 1right here to the top of this tetrahedron-- 1so let's say tetrahedron, because I 1was saying it a little bit weird. 1So now the tetrahedron, you can imagine, looks like this. 1The drawing is the hard part here. 1So now this is a face of the tetrahedron. 1I don't even have to draw the whole thing. 1I think we can visualize it. 1I'm having trouble drawing it, making 1my hand go in an awkward position. 1Let me see if I can just draw it with dotted lines. 1So that side. 1So what I've just drawn here is this face of the tetrahedron. 1I've just drawn this magenta face of the tetrahedron right 1over here. 1And I could draw the back side too. 1I could draw the backside just like that. 1I could draw it over there. 1And I think it's pretty clear to you 1that this point right here is going 1to lie right on top of this center point over here. 1So we already know a few of its coordinates. 1We know its x- and y-coordinate. 1We just need to figure out its z-coordinate. 1So its x-coordinate is going to be 0. 1It's going to be the same x-coordinate here-- 1we haven't moved along the x-axis. 1Its y-coordinate is going to be the square root of 3 over 3. 1Same as this guy over here, but it's 1going to have some height in the z-direction. 1So we need to figure out what that is. 1And to do that, what I'm going to do 1is to draw, essentially, an altitude 1for the face of this front face. 1I'm going to go from this point up to here, or from this point 1up to here. 1So if you look at this blue line right over here, 1we already figured out what this distance is. 1All the faces-- it's a regular tetrahedron-- 1so all of the faces have the same length. 1So this blue distance right over here 1is going to be the same as this distance over here, 1because this was the altitude for that bottom face. 1And we already figured out that this distance over here 1is square root of 3. 1We did that, that was the first thing 1we did that this distance over here 1from this point to this point is square root of 3. 1So this distance is also the square root of 3. 1We also know that this distance right over here-- 1let me do this in a new color-- we also 1know that this distance over here 1is the square root of 3 over 3. 1This is a right angle. 1It might not be completely obvious the way I did it, 1but this was an altitude. 1So now we can figure out the height 1of the pyramid, or the tetrahedron. 1And that height to this point is going to be our z-coordinate. 1So let's call that height h. 1So we know from the Pythagorean theorem, 1h squared plus the base squared right over here-- which 1is going to be square root of 3 over 3 squared 1is going to be 3 over 3 over 9 is going 1to be equal to the square root of 3 1squared-- it's going to be equal to 3. 1Or subtracting this from both sides, 1we have h squared is equal to-- I'll write the-- it's 3 minus 3 1over 9, 3 minus one third, which is the same thing as 9/3 1minus one third, which is equal to 8/3. 1And so if we want to take the square root of both sides, 1we'll get h is equal to the square root of 8 1is a square root of 4 times square root of 2. 1So that's 2 square roots of 2 over the square root of 3. 1So that is h. 1And that's also the z-coordinate here. 1So this is 2 square roots of 2 over the square root of 3. 1I'm already close to 14 minutes here, 1so I'm going to continue in the next video. 1But we now have the coordinate for this top point. 1So we can take the average of these three coordinates, 1find the coordinate for this point right over here, 1then find the distance between this point and this point 1that we already got the coordinate for 1to figure out how long this side is. 1And then we can prepare the ratio of that 1to that, cube it to get the ratio of the volumes.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_aime
" We're on problem 31. A sewing club is making a quilt consisting of 25 squares, with each side of the square measuring 30 centimeters. OK, and there's going to be 25 of these. And they're going to be 30 by 30. If the quilt has 5 rows and 5 columns, what is the perimeter of the quilt? OK, so let me draw that out. So it has 5 rows and 5 columns and they're all squares. So the quilt itself is going to be a square. It has 4 rows, one two, three, four, and then five. And then one, two, three, four. So that's a 5 by 5. And each of these squares, their sides are 30 centimeters. So how long is one side of this quilt going to be? It's going to be 30 times 5. So it's going to be 150 centimeters. Same argument, that's going to be 150 centimeters. And that's going to be 150 centimeters. 30 times 5. And this is going to be 150 centimeters. So the perimeter is 150 plus 150 plus 150 plus 150 and that's 600. So that's choice C. 32. The four sides of this figure will be folded up and taped to make a box. Fair enough. What will be the volume of the box? OK, so if we cut this out right now and we folded it along where I'm drawing these green lines, we'll get a box. And they want to say, what's the volume? Well, volume is just the base times the height times the depth. So if I were to fold up this box is going to look something like this. You're going to have the base, which is this base right here. And this is one, one, two, three, four, five by one, two, three, four, five. So it's 5 by 5 base. And then each of the sides are going to be 2 high if I fold this up, it's going to be 2 high like that. It's going to look like that if I folded that side up. This side, when I fold it up, is going to look like this. One, two, three, four, five. That's side when I fold it is going to look like that. And this side when I fold it up is going to look like that. One, two, three, four, five. The big picture, the width is 5, the depth is 5, and the height is 2. So the volume is 5 times 5 is 35 times 2. Which is equal to 50. And that's choice A. Problem 33. Where's 33, I think it's on the next page. OK, let me copy and paste it. I should just copy and paste the whole test. OK, it says a classroom globe has a diameter of 18 inches. If I were to go from the center to the side, it's 18 inches. Which of the following is the approximate surface area. Oh no, sorry, I just drew the radius. It has a diameter of 18 inches. This is 18. Which of the following is an approximate surface area in square inches of the globe? And surface area, they give us the equation, they give it in terms of the radius. So if the diameter is 18, what's the radius? The radius is half of the diameter. So the radius is equal to 9. And we just plug that into here. So the surface area is equal to 4 pi times the radius squared, times 9 squared. That equals 4 times 81 times pi. So it's 324 pi. And they actually multiplied it out. So let's see. Let's see, 324 pi. And if I were to guess this, I mean, look at all the choices. Pi is more than 3. So this value is going to be more than 3 times 324. So it's going to be around 1,000 or a little bit more than 1,000. And the only one that's even close to that is D. But if you wanted to confirm that, you could multiply 324 times 3.14 and that is equal to 1,017.4. All right, next problem. Problem 34. I'll copy and paste 34 and 35 at the same time. There you go. I put this there. All right, ready to do it. The rectangle shown below has a length of 20 meters and width of 10. So this is 10 and this is 20. I just picked that because this looks longer than that. That's a 10 I drew. I know it doesn't look like a 10. If the four triangles are removed from the rectangle as shown, what will be the area of the remaining figure? So what's the are before I remove them? It's 20 times 10. That's the area of the whole rectangle. So it's 200. And then how much area am I removing? So each of these triangles, what's its area? It's base times height times 1/2. That's the area of a triangle. Because if you just did base times height, you'd be figuring out the area of this little rectangle there. So the area of this is 4 times 4 is 16 times 1/2, which is 8. This is going to be 8, going to be 8, going to be 8. So we're removing four 8's from this area. So we're removing 32. So minus 32. And that's 168. So that's choice C. Problem 35. If RSTW is a rhombus, so rhombus tells us that all the sides are equal and they're parallel. What is the area of WXT. So this right here. OK, so this is something that you may or may not have learned about a rhombus already. But its diagonals actually intersect at a perpendicular line. And let me see what else we can see. This is 60 degrees, so this is 30 degrees. Let's see what we can get from this. This is 12. Then this is 12. OK, I see where they're going with this. So if this is 90 degrees, this is 90 degrees. This is a rhombus, so all the sides are the same. If this is 60, this is 90, this has to be 30 degrees. And then you could actually make a very strong argument that these are similar triangles. Whatever length this is, that's the same length, because this is a parallelogram and the diagonals bisect each other. This side is equal to that side. That side is equal to this side. So these are congruent triangles. So this is also going to be 60 degrees. This is going to be 30. But if you have a 60, let me do it in another color, if you have a 60, 60, 60 triangle, all of the angles are 60 degrees, you're dealing with an equilateral triangle. So that tells you that all the sides are the same. So if this side is 12, that side is 12, this side right here also has to be 12. If that whole side is 12, what's this length? We already know that in a parallelogram the diagonals bisect each other. So this length is 6. And this length is 6. Fair enough. And let's see, if each of these lengths are 6, can we figure out what this height is equal to? Because if we know the base and the height, we're ready to figure out the area of a triangle. So let's see if we can use the Pythagorean Theorem. If we called this x, we could say x squared plus 6 squared plus 36 is equal to 12 squared, is equal to 144. And we you could say that x squared is equal to, what's 144 minus 36, that's 108. Let's see, 108. x squared is equal to 108. x is equal to the square root of 108. And I can simplify that more because 9 goes into 108 12 times. Let me do that. So x is equal to the square root of 9 times 12, that's 108. So that's equal to the square root of 9 times the square root of 12. That's equal to 3 times the square root of 12. Square root of 12 is the same thing as the square root of 3 times the square root of 4. Square root of 4 is 2. So that's 2 times 3 is 6 square root of 3. This is 36 times 3. We could have said this is equal to the square root of 36 times the square root of 3. All right, so 6 square roots of 3. That's this side. So what's the area of this triangle right there? It's 1/2 times this base times 6 times 6 square roots of 3. 1So that's 1/2 times 6 is 3, times, 6 square roots of 3 is 118 square roots of 3. 1Now that's just this triangle. 1This triangle is congruent to this triangle, so it will have 1the same area. 1And you can make the same argument that all of these 1triangles are congruent. 1So the area of this entire rhombus is going 1to be 4 times this. 1Is that what they wanted? 1Oh no, they wanted of the area of WXD. 1That's what we just figured out. 1They didn't want the area of the whole rhombus. 1They want just the area of this triangle right there, 1which we just figured out, which is 18 square roots of 3. 1I'm trying to think if there's a simpler way of doing this. 1There might be some formula for the equation for the area 1of a rhombus that I've forgotten in my memory. 1But we were able to re-prove it. 1And that's always better, to come from basic principles. 1Anyway, I'll see you in the next video.",math_geometry-home_geometry-miscellaneous
" -  So let's get some practice simplifying hairy expressions that have exponents in them. And so we have a hairy expression right over here and I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can rewrite this in a simpler way. All right, let's work through this together and the first thing that jumps out at me is the numerator here. I have the number 125 raised to the 1/8 power times the same number, the same base, 125, raised to the 5/8 power. So I can rewrite this numerator. I can rewrite this numerator using what I know of exponent properties as being equal to 125 to the sum of these two exponents. To the negative 1/8 power plus 5/8 power. All of that is going to be over the existing denominator we have, which is five to the 1/2. All of that is going to be over five to the 1/2 power. So, these are equivalent. Notice, all I did is I added the exponents, these two exponents because I had the same base and we were taking the product of both of these 125 to the negative 1/8 and 125 to the 5/8. And so negative 1/8 plus 5/8, well that is 1/2. So, this is, this right over here is, 1/2. So, this is 125 to the 1/2, over five to the 1/2. Well, that's going to be the same thing. This is going to be equivalent to 125 over five, over five, to the 1/2 power. To the 1/2 power. If I raise 125 to the 1/2 and I'm dividing by five to the 1/2, that's the same thing as doing the division first and then raising that to the 1/2 power. Well, what's 125 divided by five? Well, that's just 25. Now what's 25 to the 1/2? Well, that's the same thing as the principal square root of 25, which is equal to five. And we're all done, that simplified quite nicely. Let's do another one of these. And this one is a little more interesting, 'cause we are starting to involve a variable, we have the variable w, but it's really going to be somewhat the same process. And here the thing that jumps out at me is the denominator. I have the same base, 3w-squared. 3w-squared raised to one power, one exponent, times the same base, 3w-squared, raised to another power. So, this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to our numerator we can just rewrite it 12w to the seventh power over negative 3/2 over our denominator we can write as this base, 3w-squared, and we can add these two exponents. So, we could add negative 2/3 to negative 5/6. Negative 2/3 to negative 5/6. Well, what is that going to be? So, let's see, if I do negative, negative 2/3 is the same thing as negative 4/6, minus 5/6, which is equal to negative 9/6, which is equal to negative 3/2. So, this right over here is the same thing as negative 3/2. Let me just write that. Negative 3/2 power. Negative 2/3 plus negative 5/6 is negative 3/2. Now, what's interesting is I have a negative 3/2 up here and I have a negative 3/2 over here, so, we can do the same thing we did in the last problem. This could simplify to 12w, 12w to the seventh power, over 3w-squared. 3w-squared. All of that, all of that to the, all of that to the negative 3/2 power. Notice what we did here. I had something to the negative 3/2 divided by something else to the negative 3/2. Well, that's the same thing as doing the division first and then raising that quotient to the negative 3/2. And what's nice about this, this is pretty straightforward to simplify. 12 divided by three is four, and w to the seventh divided by w-squared, well, we could divide both by w-squared or you could say this is the same thing as w to the seven-minus-two power. So this is going to be w to the fifth power. W to the fifth power. And so it all simplified to 4w to the fifth power to the negative 3/2. To the negative 3/2. Now, if we want to, this is already pretty simple and at some point it becomes somewhat someone's opinion on which is expression is simpler than another, and it might depend on what you're using the expression for, but one could argue that you could keep trying to simplify this, this is the same thing as, this is the same thing as four to the negative 3/2. To the negative 3/2. Times w to the fifth to the negative 3/2. And once again this is just straight out of our exponent properties. Now, four to the negative 3/2, let's just think about that. Four to the negative 3/2. We're using a different color just as a bit of an aside. So, four to the negative 3/2 is equal to, that's the same thing as one over four to the 3/2, and, let's see. The square root of four is two and then we raise that to the third power, it's gonna be eight. So, this is equal to 1/8. So, that's equal to 1/8, and so all of this is going to be equal to 1/8. And then w to the fifth, and then that to the negative 3/2, we can multiply these exponents. That's going to be w to the five times negative 3/2. Well, it's gonna be the negative 15/2 power. So, I don't know which one you would say is simpler. This one over here or this one over here but they are equivalent and they both are a lot simpler than where we started.",math_algebra-home_alg-exp-and-log
" - So let's keep thinking about different ways to sit multiple people in the certain number of chairs. So let's say we have six people. We have person A, we have person B, we have person C, person D, person E, and we have person F. So we have six people. And for the sake of this video, we're going to say oh we want to figure out all the scenarios, all the possibilities, all the permutations, all the ways that we could put them into three chairs. So there's chair number one, chair number two and chair number three. This is all review. This is covered in the permutations video. But it'll be very instructive as we move into a new concept. So what are all the permutations of putting six different people into three chairs? Well, like we've seen before, we can start with the first chair. And we can say look if no one's sat-- If we haven't seated anyone yet, how many different people could we put in chair number one? Well there's six different people who could be in chair number one. Let me get a different color. There are six people who could be in chair number one. Six different scenarios for who sits in chair number one. Now for each of those six scenarios, how many people, how many different people could sit in chair number two? Well each of those six scenarios we've taken one of the six people to sit in chair number one. So that means you have five out of the six people left to sit in chair number two. Or another way to think about it is there's six scenarios of someone in chair number one and for each of those six, you have five scenarios for who's in chair number two. So you have a total of 30 scenarios where you have seated six people in the first two chairs. And now if you want to say well what about for the three chairs? Well for each of these 30 scenarios, how many different people could you put in chair number three? Well you're still going to have four people standing up not in chairs. So for each of these 30 scenarios, you have four people who you could put in chair number three. So your total number of scenarios, or your total number of permutations where we care who's sitting in which chair is six times five times four, which is equal to 120 permutations. Permutations. Now lemme, permutations. Now it's worth thinking about what permutations are counting. Now remember we care, when we're talking about permutations, we care about who's sitting in which chair. So for example, for example this is one permutation. And this would be counted as another permutation. And this would be counted as another permutation. This would be counted as another permutation. So notice these are all the same three people, but we're putting them in different chairs. And this counted that. That's counted in this 120. I could keep going. We could have that, or we could have that. So our thinking in the permutation world. We would count all of these. Or we would count this as six different permutations. These are going towards this 120. And of course we have other permutations where we would involve other people. Where we have, it could be F, B, C, F, C, B, F, A, C, F, F. Actually let me do it this way. I'm going to be a little bit more systematic. F, uh lemme do it. B, B, F, C, B, C, F. And obviously I could keep doing. I can do 120 of these. I'll do two more. You could have C, F, B. And then you could have C, B, F. So in the permutation world, these are, these are literally 12 of the 120 permutations. But what if we, what if all we cared about is the three people we're choosing to sit down, but we don't care in what order that they're sitting, or in which chair they're sitting. So in that world, these would all be one. This is all the same set of three people if we don't care which chair they're sitting in. This would also be the same set of three people. And so this question. If I have six people sitting in three chairs, how many ways can I choose three people out of the six where I don't care which chair they sit on? And I encourage you to pause the video, and try to think of what that number would actually be. Well a big clue was when we essentially wrote all of the permutations where we've picked a group of three people. We see that there's six ways of arranging the three people. When you pick a certain group of three people, that turned into six permutations. And so if all you want to do is care about well how many different ways are there to choose three from the six? You would take your whole permutations. You would take your number of permutations. You would take your number of permutations. And then you would divide it by the number of ways to arrange three people. Number of ways to arrange, arrange three people. And we see that you can arrange three people, or even three letters. You can arrange it in six different ways. So this would be equal to 120 divided by six, or this would be equal to 20. So there are 120 permutations here. If you said how many different arrangements are there of taking six people and putting them into three chairs? That's 120. But now we're asking another thing. We're saying if we start with 120 people, and we want to choose. Sorry if we're starting with six people and we want to figure out how many ways, how many combinations, how many ways are there for us to choose three of them? Then we end up with 20 combinations. Combinations of people. This right over here, once again, this right over here is just one combination. It's the combination, A, B, C. I don't care what order they sit in. I have chosen them. I have chosen these three of the six. This is a combination of people. I don't care about the order. This right over here is another combination. It is F, C, and B. Once again I don't care about the order. I just care that I've chosen these three people. So how many ways are there to choose three people out of six? It is 20. It's the total number of permutations. It's 120 divided by the number of ways you can arrange three people.",math_statistics-probability_counting-permutations-and-combinations
" -  The rectangle below has an area of 12x to the fourth plus 6x to the third plus 15x squared square meters. And we can see the area right over here and they broke it up; this green area is 12x to the fourth, this purple area is 6x to the third, this blue area is 15x squared. You add 'em all together, you get this entire rectangle which would be the combined area is 12x to the fourth plus 6x to the third plus 15x squared. The length of the rectangle in meters, so this is the length right over here that we're talking about, so we're talking about this distance. The length of the rectangle in meters is equal to the greatest common monomial factor of 12x to the fourth, 6x to the third, and 15x squared. What is the length and width of the rectangle? I encourage you to pause the video and try to work through it on your own. Well the key realization here is that the length times the width, the length times the width is going to be equal to this area. And if the length is the greatest common monomial factor of these terms, of 12x to the fourth, 6x third, and 15x squared, well then we can factor that out and then what we have left over is going to be the width. So let's figure out what is the greatest common monomial factor of these three terms. And the first thing we could look at is let's look at the coefficients. Let's figure out what's the greatest common factor of 12, six, and 15. And there is a couple of ways you could do it. You could do it by looking at a prime factorization, you could say alright, well 12 is two times six which is two times three, that's the prime factorization of 12. Prime factorization of six is just two times three. Prime factorization of 15 is three times five. And so the greatest common factor, the largest factor that's divisible into all of them, so let's see, we can throw a three in there. Three is divisible into all of them. And that's it 'cause we can't say a three and a two. A three and a two would be divisible into 12 and six, but there's no two that's divisible into 15. We can't say a three and a five 'cause five isn't divisible into 12 or six; so the greatest common factor is going to be three. Another way we could have done this is we could have said where are the non-prime factors of each of these numbers. 12 you could have said, OK I can get 12 by saying one times 12 or two times six or three times four. Six you could have said, let's see, that could be one times six or two times three. So those are the factors of six. And then 15 you could have said well one times 15 or three times five. And so you say the greatest common factor? Well three is the largest number that I've listed here that is common to all three of these factors. So once again, the greatest common factor of 12, six, and 15 is three. So when we're looking at the greatest common monomial factor the coefficient is going to be three. And then we look at these powers of X. We have X to the fourth. I'm using a different color. We have X to the fourth, X to the third, and X squared. Well what's the largest power of X that's divisible into all of those? Well it's going to be X squared. X squared is divisible into X to the fourth and X to the third and of course X squared itself. So the greatest common monomial factor is 3x squared. This length right over here, this is 3x squared. So if this is 3x squared, we can then figure out what the width is. If we were to divide 12x to the fourth by 3x squared, what do we get? Well 12 divided by three is four and X to the fourth divided by X squared is X squared. Notice 3x squared times 4x squared is 12x to the fourth. And then we move over to this purple section. If we take 6x to the third divided by 3x squared, six divided by three is two. And then X to the third divided by X squared is just going to be X. And then last but not least, we have 15 divided by three is going to be five. X squared divided by X squared is just one, so it's just gonna be five. So the width is going to be 4x squared, plus 2x, plus five. So once again, the length, we figure that out, is the greatest common monomial factor of these terms. It's 3x squared. And the width is 4x squared plus 2x, plus five. And one way to think about it is we just factored this expression over here. We could write that. Actually I wanna see the original thing. We could write that 3x squared times 4x squared, plus 2x, plus five which is the entire width, well that's going to be equal to the area. That's going to be equal to our original expression: 12x to the fourth power plus 6x to the third plus 15x squared.",math_math3_factorization
" -  What I hope to do in this video is look at this graph y is equal to f of x and think about the intervals where this graph is positive or negative and then think about the intervals when this graph is increasing or decreasing. So first let's just think about when is this function, when is this function positive? Well positive means that the value of the function is greater than zero. It means that the value of the function this means that the function is sitting above the x-axis. So it's sitting above the x-axis in this place right over here that I am highlighting in yellow and it is also sitting above the x-axis over here. And if we wanted to, if we wanted to write those intervals mathematically. Well let's see, let's say that this point, let's say that this point right over here is x equals a. Let's say that this right over here is x equals b and this right over here is x equals c. Then it's positive, it's positive as long as x is between a and b. At x equals a or at x equals b the value of our function is zero but it's positive when x is between a and b, a and b or if x is greater than c. X is, we could write it there, c is less than x or we could write that x is greater than c. These are the intervals when our function is positive. Let me write this, f of x, f of x positive when x is in this interval or this interval or that interval. So when is f of x negative? Let me do this in another color. F of x is going to be negative. Well, it's gonna be negative if x is less than a. So this is if x is less than a or if x is between b and c then we see that f of x is below the x-axis. F of x is down here so this is where it's negative. So here or, or x is between b or c, x is between b and c. And I'm not saying less than or equal to because at b or c the value of the function f of b is zero, f of c is zero. That's where we are actually intersecting the x-axis. So that was reasonably straightforward. Now let's ask ourselves a different question. When is the function increasing or decreasing? So when is f of x, f of x increasing? Well increasing, one way to think about it is every time that x is increasing then y should be increasing or another way to think about it, you have a, you have a positive rate of change of y with respect to x. We could even think about it as imagine if you had a tangent line at any of these points. If you had a tangent line at any of these points the slope of that tangent line is going to be positive. But the easiest way for me to think about it is as you increase x you're going to be increasing y. So where is the function increasing? Well I'm doing it in blue. So it's increasing right until we get to this point right over here, right until we get to that point over there then it starts decreasing until we get to this point right over here and then it starts increasing again. It starts, it starts increasing again. So let me make some more labels here. So let's say that this, this is x equals d and that this right over here, actually let me do that in green color, so let's say this is x equals d. Now it's not a, d, b but you get the picture and let's say that this is x is equal to, x is equal to, let me redo it a little bit, x is equal to e. X is equal to e. So when is this function increasing? Well it's increasing if x is less than d, x is less than d and I'm not gonna say less than or equal to 'cause right at x equals d it looks like just for that moment the slope of the tangent line looks like it would be, it would be constant. We're going from increasing to decreasing so right at d we're neither increasing or decreasing. But then we're also increasing, so if x is less than d or x is greater than e, or x is greater than e. And where is f of x decreasing? So f of x, let me do this in a different color. When is, let me pick a mauve, so f of x decreasing, decreasing well it's going to be right over here. It's gonna be right between d and e. Between x equals d and x equals e but not exactly at those points 'cause at both of those points you're neither increasing nor decreasing but you see right over here as x increases, as you increase your x what's happening to your y? If you go from this point and you increase your x what happened to your y? Your y has decreased. You increase your x, your y has decreased, you increase your x, y has decreased, increase x, y has decreased all the way until this point over here. So f of x is decreasing for x between d and e. So hopefully that gives you a sense of things. Notice, these aren't the same intervals. That we are, the intervals where we're positive or negative don't perfectly coincide with when we are increasing or decreasing. So it's very important to think about these separately even though they kinda sound the same.",math_engageny-alg-1_alg1-3
" Let's say that f of x is equal to x times e to the negative two x squared, and we want to find any critical numbers for f. I encourage you to pause this video and think about, can you find any critical numbers of f. I'm assuming you've given a go at it. Let's just remind ourselves what a critical number is. We would say c is a critical number of f, if and only if. I'll write if with two f's, short for if and only if, f prime of c is equal to zero or f prime of c is undefined. If we look for the critical numbers for f we want to figure out all the places where the derivative of this with respect to x is either equal to zero or it is undefined. Let's think about how we can find the derivative of this. f prime of x is going to be, well let's see. We're going to have to apply some combination of the product rule and the chain rule. It's going to be the derivative with respect to x of x, so it's going to be that, times e to the negative two x squared plus the derivative with respect to x of e to the negative two x squared times x. This is just the product rule right over here. Derivative of the x times e to the negative of two x squared plus the derivative of e to the negative two x squared times x, right over here. What is this going to be? Well all of this stuff in magenta, the derivative of x with respect to x, that's just going to be equal to one. This first part is going to be equal to e to the negative two x squared. Now the derivative of e to the negative two x squared over here. I'll do this in this pink color. This part right over here, that is going to be equal to- We'll just apply the chain rule. Derivative of e to the negative two x squared with respect to negative two x squared, well that's just going to be e to the negative two x squared. We're going to multiply that times the derivative of negative two x squared with respect to x. That's going to be what, negative four x. Times negative four x, and of course we have this x over here. We have that x over there and let's see, can we simplify it at all? Well obviously both of these terms have an e to the negative two x squared. I'm going to try to figure out where this is either undefined or where this is equal to zero. Let's think about this a little bit. If we factor out e to the negative two x squared, I'll do that in green. We're going to have, this is equal to e to the negative two x squared times, we have here, one minus four x squared. One minus four x squared. This is the derivative of f. Where would this be undefined or equal to zero? e to the negative two x squared, this is going to be defined for any value of x, this part is going to be defined, and this part is also going to be defined for any value of x. There's no point where this is undefined. Let's think about when this is going to be equal to zero. The product of these two expressions equalling zero, e to the negative two x squared, that will never be equal to zero. If you get this exponent to be a really, I guess you could say very negative number, you will approach zero but you will never get it to be zero. This part here can't be zero. If the product of two things are zero at least one of them has to be zero, so the only way we can get f prime of x to be equal to zero is when one minus four x squared is equal to zero. One minus four x squared is equal to zero, let me rewrite that. One minus four x squared is equal to zero, when does that happen? This one we can just solve. Add four x squared to both sides, you get one is equal to four x squared. Divide both sides by four, you get one fourth is equal to x squared. Then what x values is this true at? We just take the plus or minus square root of both sides and you get x is equal to plus or minus one half. Negative one half squared is one fourth, positive one half squared is one fourth. If x equals plus or minus one half f prime, or the derivative, is equal to zero. Let me write it this way. f prime of one half is equal to zero, and you can verify that right over here. And f prime of negative one half is equal to zero. If someone asks what are the critical numbers here, they are one half and negative one half.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-derivatives-analyze-functions

And when you say probability, it's really just a way of measuring the likelihood that something is going to happen. And the way we're going to think about it is how many of the outcomes from this trial, from this picking a marble out of a bag, how many meet our constraints, satisfy this event? And how many possible outcomes are there? So let me write the possible outcomes right over here, so possible outcomes. And you'll see it's actually a very straightforward idea. But I'll just make sure that we understand all the words that people might say, so the set of all the possible outcomes. Well, there's three yellow marbles. So I could pick that yellow marble, that yellow marble, or that yellow marble, that yellow marble. These are clearly all yellow. There's two red marbles in the bag. So I could pick that red marble or that red marble. There's two green marbles in the bag. So I could pick that green marble or that green marble. And then there's one blue marble in the bag. There's one blue marble. So this is all the possible outcomes. And sometimes this is referred to as the sample space, the set of all the possible outcomes. Fancy word for just a simple idea, that the sample space, when I pick something out of the bag, and that picking out of the bag is called a trial, there's 8 possible things I can do. So when I think about the probability of picking a yellow marble, I want to think about, well, what are all of the possibilities? Well, there's 8 possibilities, 8 possibilities for my trial. So the number of outcomes, number of possible outcomes, you could view it as the size of the sample space, number of possible outcomes, And it's as simple as saying, look, I have 8 marbles. And then you say, well, how many of those marbles meet my constraint, that satisfy this event here? Well, there's 3 marbles that satisfy my event. There's 3 outcomes that will allow this event to occur, I guess is one way to say it. So there's 3 right over here, so number that satisfy the event or the constraint right over here. So it's very simple ideas. Many times the words make them more complicated than they need to. If I say, what's the probability of picking a yellow marble? Well, how many different types of marbles can I pick? Well, there's 8 different marbles I could pick. And then how many of them are yellow? Well, there's 3 of them that are actually yellow.",math_7th-grade-illustrative-math_unit-8-probability-and-sampling
" Let's say that f of x is equal to the natural log of x, and we want to figure out what the slope of the tangent line to the curve f is when x is equal to the number e. So here, x is equal to the number e. The point e comma 1 is on the curve. f of e is 1. The natural log of e is 1. And I've drawn the slope of the tangent line, or I've drawn the tangent line. And we need to figure out what the slope of it is, or at least come up with an expression for it. And I'm going to come up with an expression using both the formal definition and the alternate definition. That will allow us to compare them a little bit. So let's think about first the formal definition. So the formal definition wants us to find an expression for the derivative of our function at any x. So let's say that this is some arbitrary x right over here. This would be the point x comma f of x. And let's say that this is-- let's call this x plus h. So this distance right over here is going to be h. This right over here is going to be the point, x plus h f of x plus h. Now, the whole underlying idea of the formal definition of limits is to find the slope of the secant line between these two points, and then take the limit as h approaches 0. As h gets closer and closer, this blue point is going to get closer and closer and closer to x. And this point is going to approach it on the curve. And the secant line is going to become a better and better and better approximation of the tangent line at x. So let's actually do that. So what's the slope of the secant line? Well, it's the change in your vertical axis, which is going to be f of x plus h minus f of x-- over the change in your horizontal axis. And that's x plus h minus x. And we see here the difference is just h. Over h. And we're going to take the limit of that as h approaches 0. So in the case when f of x is the natural log of x, this will reduce to the limit as h approaches 0. f of x plus h is the natural log of x plus h minus the natural log of x, all of that over h. So this right over here, for our particular f of x, this is equal to f prime of x. So if we wanted to evaluate this when x is equal to e, then everywhere we see an x we just have to replace it with an e. This is essentially expressing our derivative as a function of x. It's kind of a crazy-looking function of x. You have a limit here and all of that. But every place you see an x, like any function definition, you can replace it now with an e. So we can-- let me just do that. Whoops. I lost my screen. Here we go. So we could write f prime of e is equal to the limit as h approaches 0 of natural log-- let me do it in the same color so we can keep track of things-- natural log of e plus h-- I'll just leave that blank for now-- minus the natural log of e, all of that over h. So just like that. This right over here, if we evaluate this limit-- if we're able to and we actually can-- if we are able to evaluate this limit, this would give us the slope of the tangent line when x equals e. This is doing the formal definition. Now let's do the alternate definition. The alternate definition-- if you don't want to find a general derivative expressed as a function of x like this and you just want to find the slope at a particular point, the alternate definition kind of just gets straight to the point there. So what they say is hey, look, let's imagine some other x value here. So let's imagine some other x value. This right over here is the point x comma-- well, we could say f of x or we could even say the natural log of x. What is the slope of the secant line between those two points? Well, it's going to be your change in y values. So it's going to be natural log of x minus 1-- let me do that red color-- over your change in x values. That's x minus e. So that's the slope of the secant line between those two points. Well, what if you want to get the tangent line? Well, let's just take the limit as x approaches e. As x gets closer and closer and closer, these points are going to get closer and closer and closer, and the secant line is going to better approximate the tangent line. So we're just going to take the limit as x approaches e. So either one of this. This is using the formal definition of a limit. Let me make it clear that that h does not belong part of it. So we could either do it using the formal definition or the alternate definition of the derivative.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-differentiation-1-new
" OK, I know some people aren't into green bean casseroles, but I like them. Plus, they remind me of vector fields. Each green bean is like a little arrow, and I just have the urge to line them all up so they flow in the same direction. Maybe a little wavy, representing the vectors of flow in a river or something. Maybe complete little eddies. Or maybe the beans could represent wind vectors. Long beans would be high-magnitude vectors saying there's a strong wind in that direction, and short, low-magnitude beans would mean low wind speed. You could have a hurricane in your casserole dish with the long beans of high wind speed flowing counterclockwise near the center, mellowing out towards the outer edges of the storm. The center would have the shortest beans of all, showing the calm eye of the storm. Oh, and if you're wondering why I'm not curving the beans like this is because while vector fields might have a shape or flow to them, the vectors themselves don't. They're usually shown as straight lines, or numbers, or both. But that's not because they are straight lines. Vectors just represent what's happening at a single point. It's like this tiny point and this bit of wind can only travel in one direction at a time, so the bean points in that direction. And that tiny bit of wind has a certain speed, which is represented by the length of the bean. But the bean itself is just notation. Vectors themselves don't have a shape, just a direction and a magnitude, which means a bean with a direction and magnitude is just as legitimate a vector as an arrow plotted on a graph, or as a set of two numbers, or as one complex number, or as an orange slice cut with a certain angle and thickness, or as shouting a compass direction at a precise decibel level. North. East. I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of individual vectors sitting by themselves without meaning or context. One string bean does not make a casserole or matherole, as the case may be. But fields of vectors are awesome. They do have curves and patterns, context, and real-world meaning. There are vectorizable fields permeating this casserole dish right now-- the gravitational field, for instance. Gravitational forces are affecting all of my string beans, pulling them down towards the earth. And so you could use the string beans to create a vector-field casserole that actually represents the gravitational field they are currently in. Of course, this means just lining up the beans so all point down. And since they're all affected by basically the same amount of gravity, they should all be the same length. If you are cooking at a high altitude, be sure to cut your string beans shorter by an negligible amount. Another favorite vectorizable field of mine is also currently permeating these string beans-- the electromagnetic field. And if I had a giant bar magnet as a coaster-trivet thing, maybe I'd want my casserole to show the magnetic field that is actually there. The points near the poles of the magnet would have larger vectors, and they'd curve around just like iron filings do when you put them in a magnetic field. And the beans would show how the force weakens as it gets further from the magnet and goes from north to south. Or if you want to be true to life and don't have a magnet, you could put equal-sized string beans all pointing the same way, and then make sure your casserole is always pointing north, which might make it difficult to pass around the table, but I think dish-passing simplicity can be sacrificed for the sake of science, or mathematics, whatever this is. Speaking of which, you can also invent your own vector field by making up a rule for what the vector will be at each point. Like if you just said for any point you choose, you'll take the coordinates x comma y, and give that point a vector that's y comma x, so that this point, 0, 5, has the vector 5, 0. And at negative 3, negative 1, you have negative 1, negative 3. And negative 4, 4 gets 4 and negative 4. It's so simple. But you get this awesome vector field where the vectors kind of whoosh in from the corners and crash and whoosh out. Anyway, there's lots of other stuff you can do, but I'm going to go ahead and pour some goopy stuff into here and get this thing casserole-ing. It may not look very inspiring yet, but it's far from done. The most essential part of a matherole is an awesome oniony topping, and I've got just the trick. I will even show it to you in the next video.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_vi-hart
" -  So here we have a set of parametric equations where x and y are both defined in terms of t. So if you input all the possible t's that you can into these functions and then plot the corresponding x and y's for each t, this will plot a curve in the x-y plain. What I wanna do in this video is figure out the first derivative of y with respect to x and the second derivative of y with respect to x. And in both cases it's going to be in terms of t. So let's get to it. So first lets find the first derivative of y with respect to x. First derivative of y with respect to x. And we've seen this before in other videos, where this is going to be the derivative of y with respect to t over the derivative of x with respect to t. And so this is going to be equal to, well, what is the derivative of y with respect to t? Dy, dt is equal to. Let's see, the derivative of either the 3t with respect to 3t is just e to the 3t. And then the derivative of 3t with respect to t is going to be three, so I can say times three like that, or I can put that three out front. And then the derivative of negative one, well, a constant doesn't change no matter what you do to your t, so that's just going to be zero. So that's dy, dt. So it's going to be equal to 3e to the 3t, all of that over, well, what's the derivative of x with respect to t? Derivative of x with respect to t is equal to, well, we're gonna have the three out front, and so the derivative of e to the 2t with respect to 2t is going to be e to the 2t and then we're going to take the derivative of 2t with respect to t, which is just two, so this is gonna be 6e to the 2t. 6e to the 2t. And lets see, we could simplify this a little bit. I'll now go to a neutral color. This is equal to, so this is gonna be one half, that's three over six, e to the 3t minus 2t. 3t minus 2t. And I'm just using exponent properties right over here. But if I have three t's and I take away two of those t's, I'm just gonna have a t. So this is just going to simplify to a t right over here. So now that we've now figured out the first derivative of y with respect to x in terms of t, now how do we find the second derivative? How do we find the second derivative of y with respect to x now? And I'll give you a hint! We're going to use this same idea. If you wanna find the rate of change of something with respect to x, you find the rate of change of that something with respect to t and divide it by the rate of change of x with respect to t. So what this is going to be, we wanna find the derivative of the first derivative with respect to t, so let me write this down. We wanna take the derivative, with respect to T in the numerator, of the first derivative, which I will put in blue now, of dy, dx, all of that over dx, dt. If it doesn't jump out at you why this is the same thing that we did before, I encourage you to pause the video and think about it. Think about what we did over here the first time. When we wanted to find the derivative of y with respect to x, we found the derivative of y with respect to t and then divided that by the derivative of x with respect to t. Here, we wanna find the second derivative of y with respect to x. Actually, let me just write it down out here a little bit clearer. What we really wanna do is we wanna find the derivative with respect, let me write it this way: When we wanted to find the derivative with respect to x of y, that was equal to derivative of y with respect to t over the derivative of x with respect to t. Now we wanna find the derivative with respect to x of the first derivative with respect to x. And so everywhere we saw a y here, replace that with the first derivative. So this is going to be equal to, in the numerator the derivative with respect to t of dy, dx. Notice this was derivative with respect to t of y. In fact, let me write it that way just so you can see it. So if I clear this out, if I clear that out we're gonna get, this is the derivative with respect to t of y. So hopefully you see, before we had a y there, now we have a dy, dx. Dx, dt. Now this might seem really daunting and complicated except for the fact that these are actually fairly straight things to evaluate. Taking the derivative with respect to t of the first derivative, well, that's just taking the derivative with respect to t of this, and this is pretty easy. This is the derivative, it's just gonna be one half. And the derivative with respect to t of e to the t is just e to the t. And so that's going to be over the derivative of x with respect to t, which we already saw is 6e to the 2t. 6e to the 2t. We can write this as, one half divided by six is one over 12, and then e to the t minus 2t, which is equal to, we could write this as 1/12th e to the negative t, or we could write this as one over 12 e to the t. And we're done.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-advanced-functions-new
" -  Let's now actually apply Newton's Law of Cooling. Just to remind ourselves, if capitol T is the temperature of something in celsius degrees, and lower case t is time in minutes, we can say that the rate of change, the rate of change of our temperature with respect to time, is going to be proportional and I'll write a negative K over here. We assumed our concept K is positive, then a negative K is going to proportional to the difference between the temperature of our thing and the ambient temperature in the room. Once again, why do I have a negative there? Well, because if the temperature of our thing is larger than the temperature of our room, we would expect that we would be decreasing in temperature. We would have a negative rate of chance. Temperature should be decreasing over time. If, on the other hand, our temperature is lower than the ambient temperature of the room then this thing is going to be negative and we would want a positive rate of change. Things would be warming up. That's why a negative of a negative would give you the positive. This right over here, this differential equation, we already saw it in a previous video on Newton's Law of Cooling. We even saw a general solution to that. The general solution that I care about, because we are now going to deal with the scenario where we are putting something warm in a... Or we are going to put a warm bowl of oatmeal in a room temperature room. Given that, we are going to assume the case that we saw in the last video where our temperature is greater than or equal to the ambient temperature. In that situation, our general solution boiled down to... It boiled down to temperature as a function of time is equal to some constant times e to the negative KT, negative KT, plus our ambient temperature. Plus our ambient temperature. Once again, we figured this out in our last video. Now, let's actually apply it. I said we were dealing with the scenario where our temperature is greater than or equal to the ambient temperature. Let's assume we are in a scenario... Let's assume a scenario where our ambient temperature is 20 degrees celsius. We assume that doesn't change. The room is just large enough that even if something that is warmer is put into it the ambient temperature does not change. Let's say that the thing that we have put in it, our warm bowl of oatmeal, let's say it starts off the moment we put it in the room, that time equals zero, is 80 degrees celsius. Let's say we also know, just from previous tests, that after two minutes, after two minutes, it gets to 60 degrees celsius. We also know that T of two is 60 degrees celsius. Given all of this information right over here, using Newton's Law of Cooling, and using all of this information we know about how bowls of oatmeal that start at this temperature have cooled in the past, we want to know how long it will take. How many minutes will have to pass when you put an 80 degree bowl of oatmeal in the room? How many minutes have to pass in order for it to get to 40 degrees using this model? Let me write that down. So how long... How many minutes for... or let me just say to cool to 40 degrees celsius? I encourage you to pause the video now and try to figure it out. I'm assuming you have paused the video, and you have had your go at it and the key is to use all of this information right over here to solve for the constants C and K, and once you know that, you essentially have described your model. Then you can apply it to solve for the time that gets you to a temperature of 40 degrees celsius. So let's do that. The first thing we know is the ambient temperature is 20 degrees celsius. This right over here is 20 degrees. The most obvious thing to solve for or to apply is what happens with T of zero. What's neat about T of zero, when T equals zero, this exponent is zero, either the zero power is one, and so T of zero is essentially going to simplify to Ce plus 20 degrees. Let me actually right that down. T of zero, which we already know is 80 degrees, we already know as 80 degrees celsius. I'm just going to write 80. We will assume it's in degrees celsius. That is going to be equal to... That is going to be equal to when T equals zero, this, the e to the zero is just going to be one. It's going to be equal to C plus, C plus 20. If you want to solve for C, you just subtract 20 from both sides of this equation. We are left with... We are left with 80 minus 20 is 60, is equal to C. 60 is equal to C. We were able to figure out C. Let's figure out what we know right now. We know that T, let me do that in magenta color. We know that T of t, that's confusing, upper case T of lower case t, temperature as a function of time, is going to be equal to... is going to be equal to in that same color, 60 e to the negative KT, negative KT plus 20, plus our ambient temperature. Plus our ambient temperature. Now, we need to solve for K. We can use this information right over here to solve for K. T of two is equal to 60 degrees. If we make t as equal to two, this thing is going to be 60 degrees. Let me write that down. Let me write that over here so we have some space. We have 60 is equal to... 60 is equal to 60, is equal to 60 e to the negative K T, all this color switching takes time, e to the negative K T, plus oh, and be careful, that's a times two. E to the negative K times two. That's a time equals two, I could write that E to the negative two K. E to the negative two K, and then of course we have our plus 20. Then we have our plus 20. Now we just have to solve for K. Once again, at any point, if you feel inspired to do so I encourage you to try to solve it on your own. Alright, so let's do this. If we subtract 20 from both sides, we get 40 is equal to 60 e to the negative two K. Divide both sides by 60. You are left with two thirds. 40 divided by 60 is two thirds. is equal to e to the negative two K. E to the negative two K. All this color changing takes work. Let me know if y'all want me to keep changing. I enjoy changing colors. It just keeps it interesting on the screen. Anyway, e to the negative two K. Actually, let me scroll down a little bit so I have some more real estate to work with. Now I can take, let's see. I can take the natural log of both sides. So, I'll have the natural log. Natural log of two thirds is equal to the natural log of e to the negative two K. That's the whole reason why I took the natural log of both sides. Then to solve for K, I divide both sides by negative two. I get K is equal to negative one half. Negative one half the natural log of two thirds. I just swapped sides. Natural log of two thirds. Let me do that since I kept the colors going so long, let me keep it that way. Natural log of two thirds. So we have solved for all of the constants. Now we can rewrite this thing right over here. We can rewrite it as... We just need a mini drumroll here, we are not completely done yet. We get t of T is equal to 60 e... e to the negative K. Well, negative K, the negative and negative is going to be positive. It will be one half natural log of two thirds. So one half natural log of two thirds. Negative K, so negative of a negative. One half natural log of two thirds, which actually will be a negative value. Two thirds is less than e, so you are going to have a natural log of it is going to be negative so it makes you feel good that the temperature is going to be going down over time. So, plus or times T, plus 20. Now, all we have to do is figure out what T get us to a temperature of 40 degrees celsius. Let's solve for that. If we want this to be 40, 40 is equal to... Actually now I'm just going to stick to one color as we march through this part. 40 is going to be equal to 60 e to the one half natural log of two thirds T power plus 20. Now, let's see. We can subtract 20 from both sides. We get to 20 is equal to 60 e to all that crazy business, one half natural log of two thirds times T. Now we can divide both sides by 60 and we get one third. 20 divided by 60 is one third, is equal to e to the one half natural log of two thirds times T. 1Now, let's see, we can take the natural log of both sides. 1The natural log of one third is equal to 1one half natural log of two thirds times T 1and then home stretch to solve for T 1you just divide both sides by one half 1natural log of two thirds. 1We get T is equal to this, which is 1the natural log of one third divided by 1one half natural log of two thirds. 1Well, if you divide by one half that's the same thing 1as multiplying by two. 1Then you are going to divide by natural log of two thirds. 1Let's see if this actually makes a sensical answer. 1Let me get a calculator out. 1Actually, I could just use Google here. 1I had ... I already forgot what it was. 1Natural log one-- 1So I had natural log one third 1over natural log of two thirds 1and the whole thing times two. 1So I can type two times the natural log of one third 1divided by the natural log of two thirds. 1Let's see what Google gets us. 1Alright, it didn't ... 1How did I mess up? 1This is equal to two times the natural log-- 1Oh, okay, it messed up the parenthesis. 1Let me make this clear. 1The natural log of one third 1divided by the natural log of two thirds. 1Then, there you go. 1If we were to round to the nearest hundredth 1it would be five point four two. 1Five point four two minutes. 1Remember, everything we were doing were in minutes. 1This right over here, this is approximately equal to 1five point four two. 1Five point four two minutes. 1And we are done! 1That's how long it will take us to cool to 40 degrees.",math_differential-equations_first-order-differential-equations
" -  Before applying to law school in the US, students need to take an exam called the LSAT. Before applying to medical school, students need to take an exam called the MCAT. Here are some summary statistics for each exam. So the LSAT, the mean score is 151 with a standard deviation of 10. And the MCAT, the mean score is 25.1 with a standard deviation of 6.4 Juwan took both exams. He scored 172 on the LSAT and 37 on the MCAT. Which exam did he do relatively better on? So pause this video, and see if you can figure it out. So the way I would think about it is you can't just look at the absolute score because they are on different scales and they have different distributions. But we can use this information. If we assume it's a normal distribution or relatively close to a normal distribution with a meet, centered at this mean, we can think about, well, how many standard deviations from the mean did he score in each of these situations? In both cases, he scored above the mean. But how many standard deviations above the mean? So let's see if we can figure that out. So on the LSAT, let's see, let me write this down, on the LSAT, he scored 172. So how many standard deviations is that going to be? Well, let's take 172, his score, minus the mean, so this is the absolute number that he scored above the mean, and now let's divide that by the standard deviation. So on the LSAT, this is what? This is going to be 21 divided by 10. So this is 2.1 standard deviations, deviations above the mean, above the mean. You could view this as a z-score. It's a z-score of 2.1. We are 2.1 above the mean in this situation. Now, let's think about how he did on the MCAT. On the MCAT, he scored a 37. The mean is a 25.1, and there is a standard deviation of 6.4. So let's see, 37.1 minus 25 would be 12, but now it's gonna be 11.9, 11.9 divided by 6.4. So without even looking at this, so this is going to be approximately, well, this is gonna be a little bit less than two. This is going to be less than two. So based on this information, and we could figure out the exact number here. In fact, let me get my calculator out. So you get the calculator. So if we do 11.9 divided by 6.4, that's gonna get us to one point, I'll just say one point, I'll just say approximately 1.86, so approximately 1.86. So relatively speaking, he did slightly better on the LSAT. He did more standard deviations, although this is close. I would say they're comparable. He did roughly two standard deviations if we were to round to the nearest standard deviation. But if you wanted to get precise, he did a little bit better, relatively speaking, on the LSAT. He did 2.1 standard deviations here while over here he did 1.86 or 1.9 standard deviations. But in everyday language, you would probably say, well, this is comparable. If this was three standard deviations and this is one standard deviation, then you'd be like, oh, he definitely did better on the LSAT.",math_statistics-probability_modeling-distributions-of-data
" f of x is equal to 2x squared plus 15x minus 8. g of x is equal to x squared plus 10x plus 16. Find f/g of x. Or you could interpret this is as f divided by g of x. And so based on the way I just said it, you have a sense of what this means. f/g, or f divided by g, of x, by definition, this is just another way to write f of x divided by g of x. You could view this as a function, a function of x that's defined by dividing f of x by g of x, by creating a rational expression where f of x is in the numerator and g of x is in the denominator. And so this is going to be equal to f of x-- we have right up here-- is 2x squared 15x minus 8. And g of x-- I will do in blue-- is right over here, g of x. So this is all going to be over g of x, which is x squared plus 10x plus 16. And you could leave it this way, or you could actually try to simplify this a little bit. And the easiest way to simplify this would see if we could factor the numerator and the denominator expressions into maybe simpler expressions. And maybe some of them might be on-- maybe both the numerator and denominator is divisible by the same expression. So let's try to factor each of them. So first, let's try the numerator. And I'll actually do it up here. So let's do it. Actually, I'll do it down here. So if I'm looking at 2x squared plus 15x minus 8, we have a quadratic expression where the coefficient is not 1. And so one technique to factor this is to factor by grouping. You could also use the quadratic formula. And when you factor by grouping, you're going to split up this term, this 15x. And you're going to split up into two terms where the coefficients are, if I were to take the product of those coefficients, they're going to be equal to the product of the first and the last terms. And we proved that in other videos. So essentially, we want to think of two numbers that add up to 15, but whose product is equal to negative 16. And this is just the technique of factoring by grouping. It's really just an attempt to simplify this right over here. So what two numbers that, if I take their product, I get negative 16. But if I add them, I get 15? Well, if I take the product and get a negative number, that means they have to have a different sign. And so that means one of them is going to be positive, one of them is going to be negative, which means one of them is going to be larger than 15 and one of them is going to be smaller than 15. And the most obvious one there might be 16, positive 16, and negative 1. If I multiply these two things, I definitely get negative 16. If I add these two things, I definitely get 15. So what we can do is we can split this. We can rewrite this expression as 2x squared plus 2x squared plus 16x minus x minus 8. All I did here is I took this middle term and, using this technique right over here, I split it into 16x minus x, which is clearly still just 15x. Now what's useful about this-- and this is why we call it factoring by grouping-- is we can see, are there any common factors in these first two terms right over here? Well, both 2x squared and 16x, they are both divisible by 2x. So you could factor out a 2x of these first two terms. This is the same thing as 2x times x plus x plus 8. 16 divided by 2 is 8, x divided by x is 1. So this is 2x times x plus 8. And then the second two terms right over here-- this is the whole basis of factoring by grouping-- we can factor out a negative 1. So this is equal to negative 1 times x plus 8. And what's neat here is now we have two terms. Both of them have an x plus 8 in them. So we can factor out an x plus 8. So if we factor out an x plus 8, we're left with 2x minus 1, put parentheses around it, times the factored out x plus 8. So we've simplified the numerator. The numerator can be rewritten. And you could have gotten here using the quadratic formula as well. The numerator is 2x minus 1 times x plus 8. And now see if you can factor the denominator. And this one's more straightforward. The coefficient here is 1. So we just have to think of two numbers that when I multiply them, I get 16. And when I add them, I get 10. And the obvious one is 8 and 2, positive 8 and positive 2. So we can write this as x plus 2 times x plus 8. And now, we can simplify it. We can divide the numerator and denominator by x plus 8, assuming that x does not equal negative 8. Because this function right over here that's defined by f divided by g, it is not defined when g of x is equal to 0, because then you have something divided by 0. And the only times that g of x is equal to 0 is when x is equal to negative 2 or x is equal to negative 8. So if we divide the numerator and the denominator by x plus 8 to simplify it, in order to not change the function definition, we have to still put the constraint that x cannot be equal to negative 8. That the original function, in order to not change it-- because if I just cancelled these two things out, the new function with these canceled would be defined when x is equal to negative 8. But we want this simplified thing to be the same exact function. And this exact function is not defined when x is equal to negative 8. So now we can write f/g of x, which is really just f of x divided by g of x, is equal to 2x minus 1 over x plus 2. You have to put the condition there that x cannot be equal to negative 8. If you lost this condition, then it won't be the exact same function as this, because this is not defined when x is equal to negative 8.",math_algebra-home_alg-functions
" -  Let's now do some examples that test our understanding of what happens when we multiply or divide a bunch of positive or negative numbers together. And like always, pause the video and see if you can work through it on your own before I do it. So first question: What is the sign of s to the 67th power divided by t to the ninth power, divided by the expression 3s times s over 4t, when s is less than zero, and t is greater than zero? So the really interesting thing here is that s is less than zero, s is negative. So if s is a negative number, we first have s to the 67th power. And we just have to remind ourselves, a negative number being multiplied, if you have an odd number of negative numbers being multiplied together, you're going to have a negative number. And s to the 67th power, that's 67 ses, so it's literally s times s times s, and you literally are going to have 67 of these ses, and you're multiplying them all together. So you have an odd number of ses, an odd number of negative numbers that you're multiplying together. So if you have an odd number of negative numbers multiplied together? Well that means that the product is going to be negative. So this thing right over here is going to be negative. Now what's t to the ninth? Well, t is a positive number, they tell us that. They tell us that t is greater than zero. Well, a positive number, really to any power, however many you have that multiply together with an even or odd, if it's just all positive, well this is going to be positive. So this thing right over here is going to be positive. Now what's a negative divided by a positive? Well a negative divided by a positive is going to be negative. We've already seen that show before. So this whole thing, I'll circle it like that, is going to be a negative. And so that this thing doesn't get too messy, actually let me just rewrite this. So all of this stuff that we've written over here, I'll just write this as this is going to be some negative number, and then we're going to divide it by 3s times s over 4t. Now this expression right over here. What is s divided by 4t going to be? Is that going to be positive or negative? Well we know that s is negative. T is positive, so four times t is going to be positive. So this thing right over here is going to be positive. Negative divided by positive, well that's going to be a negative. So actually let me just write it this way. So all of this stuff, I could just replace with s divided by 4t is going to be a negative. So times a negative, times some other negative number. Now what's 3s? Well s is negative, so 3s is negative. So that is negative, so you have a negative times a negative. Which is a positive. So all of this business right over here is going to be positive. Another way you could think about it is you're going to have a negative times a negative, which is positive, and then divide that by a positive, it's just going to be positive. So all of that, so this whole thing, all of this business right over here, is going to be a positive. This is all a negative, this is a positive. You're gonna have a negative divided by a positive. Well that's just going to be negative. So the sign of this crazy expression right over here? It's going to be negative if s is less than zero and t is greater than zero. Let's keep going, this is fun. All right. So what is the sign of p times q over p, times four and 2/7, when p is greater than zero, and q is equal to zero. And the way I just stressed q is equal to zero should be a big hint. And let me give you another hint. Pause the video, if you really think about what I just said, that q is equal to zero, you should be able to do this in less than a second. So why did I say that you could do this in less than a second? Well if you just have a bunch of numbers, and then you multiply them times zero at some point in that, the whole thing is just going to be equal to zero. I could literally have a times b times c times d, I could multiply a bunch of numbers. And if I just knew that one of these numbers is zero, then the whole product is going to be equal to zero. You know if c is equal to zero, I could multiply a times b times d times e and get some number, and then multiply that times c, it's gonna be anything times zero is zero. Now notice, q is equal to zero, and q is right over here. So I could take p divided by p, that's gonna be one. One times q, that's just gonna be zero, as one times zero is zero, then you're gonna have zero times four and 2/7, it's just all gonna be zero. And the key is, there's a zero right over here. At some point you're multiplying this entire product times zero, so the whole product is going, or you're multiplying these numbers times zero, so the whole product is going to be zero. So this side isn't positive or negative, it's zero. All right, there's no sign there. It's neither positive nor negative. All right, let's do another one. What is the sign of negative 3/4 times negative a to the fourth over three, when a is less than zero? So they're telling us that a is negative. So a is negative. So let me use a more dramatic color. So right over here, I have a negative number to the fourth power. So it's a times a times a times a. And we've already said if you have an even number of negatives being multiplied by each other, then that's going to be a positive. You could even see it over here, I mean they're all negative, but a negative times a negative is going to be a positive. A negative times the negative, I take the third and the fourth one here, that's gonna be a positive. And then a positive times a positive, the whole thing is going to be positive, even though each of these are negative. Negative times negative, or another way you could say it, a times a is going to be positive, then times a is going to be negative, but then you multiply times a again, it's going to be positive again. So a to the fourth power is going to be positive. But then you have a negative in front of it. So you're taking the negative of a positive divided by a positive, Well, so this, all of this stuff right over here is all gonna be positive, but then you have this negative in front. So this entire thing inside the parentheses is going to be a negative. And then you have a negative, negative 3/4, times a negative, well a negative times a negative, the whole thing is going to be positive. So what's the sign of this? It's going to be positive. Let's do another one, I'm having too much fun. All right, what is the sign of x to the 59th power, divided by 2.3x times 4/5, when x is less than zero? So x is once again a negative number. So x to the 59th power, that's an odd number of negatives being multiplied together. So this thing right over here is going to be negative. That's going to be negative right over there. And this x right over here is going to be negative. And so 2.3 times that x, well that's going to be negative as well, so this thing is going to be negative. That's going to be negative. A negative divided by a negative, is a positive. So all of this business is going to be a positive. A positive times a positive, well that's just gonna be positive. So all of this whole thing is going to be positive. I can't stop, this is, all right. What is the sign of negative x, times y divided by 7/8? And here they're showing us x and y on a number line. And the key takeaways here is that x is positive, x is to the right of zero, y is negative. So let's think about this. X is positive, but then we're taking the negative of x right over here. So x is positive but negative of x is going to be negative. You bring a negative number in front of a positive number, that's going to be a negative number. Now what's y divided by 7/8? Y is a negative number. I'm dividing it by a positive number. So a negative divided by a positive is going to be a negative. So this whole expression, this whole expression right over here, is going to be negative. And then we have a negative, all of this stuff, times a negative, well that's going to give us a positive. So the whole thing here is going to be positive.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-numbers-operations
" In the last video, I showed you that if someone were to walk up to you and ask you what is the arcsine-- Whoops. --arcsine of x? And so this is going to be equal to who knows what. This is just the same thing as saying that the sine of some angle is equal to x. And we solved it in a couple of cases in the last example. So using the same pattern-- Let me show you this. I could have also rewritten this as the inverse sine of x is equal to what. These are equivalent statements. Two ways of writing the inverse sine function. This is more-- This is the inverse sine function. You're not taking this to the negative 1 power. You're just saying the sine of what-- So what question mark-- What angle is equal to x? And we did this in the last video. So by the same pattern, if I were to walk up to you on the street and I were to say the tangent of-- the inverse tangent of x is equal to what? You should immediately in your head say, oh he's just asking me-- He's just saying the tangent of some angle is equal to x. And I just need to figure out what that angle is. So let's do an example. So let's say I were walk up to you on the street. There's a lot of a walking up on a lot of streets. I would write -- And I were to say you what is the arctangent of minus 1? Or I could have equivalently asked you, what is the inverse tangent of minus 1? These are equivalent questions. And what you should do is you should, in your head-- If you don't have this memorized, you should draw the unit circle. Actually let me just do a refresher of what tangent is even asking us. The tangent of theta-- this is just the straight-up, vanilla, non-inverse function tangent --that's equal to the sine of theta over the cosine of theta. And the sine of theta is the y-value on the unit function-- on the unit circle. And the cosine of theta is the x-value. And so if you draw a line-- Let me draw a little unit circle here. So if I have a unit circle like that. And let's say I'm at some angle. Let's say that's my angle theta. And this is my y-- my coordinates x, y. We know already that the y-value, this is the sine of theta. Let me scroll over here. Sine of theta. And we already know that this x-value is the cosine of theta. So what's the tangent going to be? It's going to be this distance divided by this distance. Or from your algebra I, this might ring a bell, because we're starting at the origin from the point 0, 0. This is our change in y over our change in x. Or it's our rise over run. Or you can kind of view the tangent of theta, or it really is, as the slope of this line. The slope. So you could write slope is equal to the tangent of theta. So let's just bear that in mind when we go to our example. If I'm asking you-- and I'll rewrite it here --what is the inverse tangent of minus 1? And I'll keep rewriting it. Or the arctangent of minus 1? I'm saying what angle gives me a slope of minus 1 on the unit circle? So let's draw the unit circle. Let's draw the unit circle like that. Then I have my axes like that. And I want a slope of minus 1. A slope of minus 1 looks like this. If it was like that, it would be slope of plus 1. So what angle is this? So in order to have a slope of minus 1, this distance is the same as this distance. And you might already recognize that this is a right angle. So these angles have to be the same. So this has to be a 45 45 90 triangle. This is an isosceles triangle. These two have to add up to 90 and they have to be the same. So this is 45 45 90. And if you know your 45 45 90-- Actually, you don't even have to know the sides of it. In the previous video, we saw that this is going to be-- Right here. This distance is going to be square root of 2 over 2. So this coordinate in the y-direction is minus square root of 2 over 2. And then this coordinate right here on the x-direction is square root of 2 over 2 because this length right there is that. So the square root of 2 over 2 squared plus the square root of 2 over 2 squared is equal to 1 squared. But the important thing to realize is this is a 45 45 90 triangle. So this angle right here is-- Well if you're just looking at the triangle by itself, you would say that this is a 45 degree angle. But since we're going clockwise below the x-axis, we'll call this a minus 45 degree angle. So the tangent of minus 40-- Let me write that down. So if I'm in degrees. And that tends to be how I think. So I could write the tangent of minus 45 degrees it equals this negative value-- minus square root of 2 over 2 over square root of 2 over 2, which is equal to minus 1. Or I could write the arctangent of minus 1 is equal to minus 45 degrees. Now if we're dealing with radians, we just have to convert this to radians. So we multiply that times-- We get pi radians for every 180 degrees. The degrees cancel out. So you have a 45 over 180. This goes four times. So this is equal to-- you have the minus sign-- minus pi over 4 radians. So the arctangent of minus 1 is equal to minus pi over 4 or the inverse tangent of minus 1 is also equal to minus pi over 4. Now you could say, look. If I'm at minus pi over 4, that's there. That's fine. This gives me a value of minus 1 because the slope of this line is minus 1. But I can keep going around the unit circle. I could add 2 pi to this. Maybe I could add 2 pi to this and that would also give me-- If I took the tangent of that angle, it would also give me minus 1. Or I could add 2 pi again and it'll, again, give me minus 1. In fact I could go to this point right here. And the tangent would also give me minus 1 because the slope is right there. And like I said in the sine-- in the inverse sine video, you can't have a function that has a 1 to many mapping. You can't-- Tangent inverse of x can't map to a bunch of different values. It can't map to minus pi over 4. It can't map to 3-- what it would be? --3 pi over 4. I don't know. It would be-- I'll just say 2 pi minus pi over 4. Or 4 pi minus pi. It can't map to all of these different things. So I have to constrict the range on the inverse tan function. And we'll restrict it very similarly to the way we restricted the sine-- the inverse sine range. We're going to restrict it to the first and fourth quadrants. So the answer to your inverse tangent is always going to be something in these quadrants. But it can't be this point and that point. Because a tangent function becomes undefined at pi over 2 and at minus pi ever 2. Because your slope goes vertical. You start dividing-- Your change in x is 0. You're dividing-- Your cosine of theta goes to 0. So if you divide by that, it's undefined. So your range-- So if I-- Let me write this down. So if I have an inverse tangent of x, I'm going to-- Well, what are all the values that the tangent can take on? So if I have the tangent of theta is equal to x, what are all the different values that x could take on? These are all the possible values for the slope. And that slope can take on anything. So x could be anywhere between minus infinity and positive infinity. x could pretty much take on any value. But what about theta? Well I just said it. Theta, you can only go from minus pi over 2 all the way to pi over 2. And you can't even include pi over 2 or minus pi over 2 because then you'd be vertical. So then you say your-- So if I'm just dealing with vanilla tangent. Not the inverse. The domain-- Well the domain of tangent can go multiple times around, so let me not make that statement. But if I want to do inverse tangent so I don't have a 1 to many mapping. I want to cross out all of these. I'm going to restrict theta, or my range, to be greater than the minus pi over 2 and less than positive pi over 2. And so if I restrict my range to this right here and I exclude that point and that point. Then I can only get one answer. When I say tangent of what gives me a slope of minus 1? And that's the question I'm asking right there. There's only one answer. Because if I keep-- This one falls out of it. And obviously as I go around and around, those fall out of that valid range for theta that I was giving you. And then just to kind of make sure we did it right. Our answer was pi over 4. Let's see if we get that when we use our calculator. So the inverse tangent of minus 1 is equal to that. Let's see if that's the same thing as minus pi over 4. Minus pi over 4 is equal to that. So it is minus pi over 4. But it was good that we solved it without a calculator because 1it's hard to recognize this as minus pi over 4.",math_engageny-precalc_precalc-4
" I have been asked for some intuition as to why, let's say, a to the minus b is equal to 1 over a to the b. And before I give you the intuition, I want you to just realize that this really is a definition. I don't know. The inventor of mathematics wasn't one person. It was, you know, a convention that arose. But they defined this, and they defined this for the reasons that I'm going to show you. Well, what I'm going to show you is one of the reasons, and then we'll see that this is a good definition, because once you learned exponent rules, all of the other exponent rules stay consistent for negative exponents and when you raise something to the zero power. So let's take the positive exponents. Those are pretty intuitive, I think. So the positive exponents, so you have a to the 1, a squared, a cubed, a to the fourth. What's a to the 1? a to the 1, we said, is a, and then to get to a squared, what did we do? We multiplied by a, right? a squared is just a times a. And then to get to a cubed, what did we do? We multiplied by a again. And then to get to a to the fourth, what did we do? We multiplied by a again. Or the other way, you could imagine, is when you decrease the exponent, what are we doing? We are multiplying by 1/a, or dividing by a. And similarly, you decrease again, you're dividing by a. And to go from a squared to a to the first, you're dividing by a. So let's use this progression to figure out what a to the 0 is. So this is the first hard one. So a to the 0. So you're the inventor, the founding mother of mathematics, and you need to define what a to the 0 is. And, you know, maybe it's 17, maybe it's pi. I don't know. It's up to you to decide what a to the 0 is. But wouldn't it be nice if a to the 0 retained this pattern? That every time you decrease the exponent, you're dividing by a, right? So if you're going from a to the first to a to the zero, wouldn't it be nice if we just divided by a? So let's do that. So if we go from a to the first, which is just a, and divide by a, right, so we're just going to go-- we're just going to divide it by a, what is a divided by a? Well, it's just 1. So that's where the definition-- or that's one of the intuitions behind why something to the 0-th power is equal to 1. Because when you take that number and you divide it by itself one more time, you just get 1. So that's pretty reasonable, but now let's go into the negative domain. So what should a to the negative 1 equal? Well, once again, it's nice if we can retain this pattern, where every time we decrease the exponent we're dividing by a. So let's divide by a again, so 1/a. So we're going to take a to the 0 and divide it by a. a to the 0 is one, so what's 1 divided by a? It's 1/a. Now, let's do it one more time, and then I think you're going to get the pattern. Well, I think you probably already got the pattern. What's a to the minus 2? Well, we want-- you know, it'd be silly now to change this pattern. Every time we decrease the exponent, we're dividing by a, so to go from a to the minus 1 to a to the minus 2, let's just divide by a again. And what do we get? If you take 1/2 and divide by a, you get 1 over a squared. And you could just keep doing this pattern all the way to the left, and you would get a to the minus b is equal to 1 over a to the b. Hopefully, that gave you a little intuition as to why-- well, first of all, you know, the big mystery is, you know, something to the 0-th power, why does that equal 1? First, keep in mind that that's just a definition. Someone decided it should be equal to 1, but they had a good reason. And their good reason was they wanted to keep this pattern going. And that's the same reason why they defined negative exponents in this way. And what's extra cool about it is not only does it retain this pattern of when you decrease exponents, you're dividing by a, or when you're increasing exponents, you're multiplying by a, but as you'll see in the exponent rules videos, all of the exponent rules hold. All of the exponent rules are consistent with this definition of something to the 0-th power and this definition of something to the negative power. Hopefully, that didn't confuse you and gave you a little bit of intuition and demystified something that, frankly, is quite mystifying the first time you learn it.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-numbers-operations
" Let's try to subtract 164 from 301, and I encourage you to pause this video and try it on your own first. So let's go place by place, and we can realize where we have to do some borrowing or regrouping. So in the ones place, we have an issue. 4 is larger than 1. How do we subtract a larger number from a smaller number? We also an issue in the tens place. 6 is larger than 0. How do we subtract 6 from 0? So the answer that might be jumping into your head is oh, we've got to do some borrowing or some regrouping. But then you might be facing another problem. You'd say, OK, well, let's try to borrow from the tens place here. So we have a 1. If we could borrow 10 from the tens place, it could be 11. But there's nothing here in the tens place. There's nothing to borrow, so what do we do? So the way I would tackle it is first borrow for the tens place. So we have nothing here, so let's regroup 100 from the hundreds place. So that's equivalent to borrowing a 1 from the hundreds place. So that's now a 2. And now in the tens place, instead of a 0, we are going to have a 10. Now, let's make sure that this still makes sense. This is 200 plus 10 tens. 10 tens is 100, plus 1. 200 plus 100 plus 1 is still 301. So this still makes sense. Now, the reason why this is valuable is now we have something to regroup from the tens place. If we take one of these tens, so now we're left with 9 tens, and we give it to the ones place, so you give 10 plus 1, you're going to be left with 11. And we can verify that we still haven't changed the value of the actual number. 200 plus 90 is 290, plus 11 is still 301. And what was neat about this is now up here, all of these numbers are larger than the corresponding number in the same place. So we're ready to subtract. 11 minus 4 is-- let's see, 10 minus 3 is 7, so 11 minus 4 is 7. 9 minus 6 is 3, and 2 minus 1 is 1. So we are left with 137.",math_5th-grade-foundations-engageny_5th-m1-engage-ny-foundations
" Let's do a bunch more of these addition problems. So let's say I have 9,367 plus 2,459. So we can do this the exact same way we've done in the last few videos. We start in the 1's place or you can even think of it as the 1's column. So you're going to add the seven 1's plus the 9 1's. So you're going to have 7 plus 9, which we hopefully know by now is 16. So what we do is we write the 6 in the 1's place and we carry the 1. Let me switch-- if this 1 is going to be the same thing as that 1 right there. And this might look like a little bit of a mystery or magic, and the whole reason we did that is that this is the 10's place. And when you write 16 you have six 1's and one 10. If you view this as money, what's the best way to get $16 in a world where there weren't $5 bills? Where you only had $1 bills, $10 bills, $10 bills, and so on. Only multiples of 10. And we don't have any $5 bills. In that world you would represent 16 as one $10 bill just like that. And then six $1 bills. So that's two $1 bills. That's two more $1 bills. And then that's two more $1 bills. The whole reason why I'm drawing it this way or I'm even using this analogy or drawing the dollar bills is to show you what these places mean. When I say that this right here is the 10's place, I'm essentially telling you how many $10 bills do I have? If I've $16 and I'm doing it as efficiently as I can in a world without $5 bills. I only have $1's, $10's, and $100's and $1,000 bills and so forth. And this is the 1's. So when I write it this way I'm literally telling you, I have one $10 bill and I have six $1 bills. That's what $16 is. And so when I have 7 plus 9 is equal to 16 I say that I have six $1 bills and I have one $10 bill. And I add that one $10 bill to everything else in the ten space. And the tens place is essentially telling you how many-- that's the tens. I could write it like that or I could write the 10's place. When I have 67-- 67 means I have six $10 bills plus another seven $1's. So that's six 10's, five 10's. So I add up everything in the tens place. So 1 plus 6 plus 5. Let me do that in a new color. 1 plus 6 plus 5 is equal to-- 1 plus 6 is 7. 7 plus 5 is 12. So I write the 2 in the 10's place because remember, this is twelve $10 bills because we're in the 10's place. So I have two in the 10's place and I put the 1-- I carried this 1 right here into the 100's place. Because if I have twelve $10 bills, I have $120. I have one $100 bill. And I have two $10 bills. I'll stop going to the dollar bill analogy just so we can make sure we understand the process. But I think you see how it works. You start at the right, you add the two numbers up. If it's a two-digit answer you carry the left most digit up to the next column. And you just keep doing that. So let's do this one right here. 1 plus 3 is 4. Let me write this down in another color. 1 plus 3 plus 4. 1 plus 3 is 4. Plus 4 is 8. So 1 plus 3 plus 4 is 8. Nothing to carry. It was a one-digit number. And then finally, I have 9 plus 2. That's equal to 11, so I write the 1 down there. I write this 1 and then if there was anything left here I would carry the 10's or the other 1-- the 1 in the 10's place in 11-- I would carry it. But there's no where to carry it to, so I write it down just like that. So 9.367 plus 2,459 is 11,826. And I just put that comma there because it's easier for me to read. Let me do a bunch more of these. Let's do a really, really daunting problem. Let's do something in the millions. Just to show you that you can do any problem. So let's say we have 2,349,015. Let's throw a 0 in there. We have nothing in the hundreds place there. And I want to add that to-- let me switch colors just for fun. I want to add that to 7,-- let's put a 0 there-- 15,999. Let's add these two numbers. It seems like a hard problem, but if we just focus on each of the places I think you'll find that it's not too bad. So we start off with 5 plus 9. That's equal to 14. Write the 4 down here, carry the 1. Then you go into the 10's place. 1 plus 1 is 2. 2 plus 9-- let me switch colors. 1 plus 1 is 2. 2 plus 9 is 11. Carry the 1. Now we're in the 100's place. 1 plus 0 is 1. Plus 9 is 10. So we write the 0 from the 10, carry the 1. Let me switch colors again. 1 plus 9 is 10. 10 plus 5 is 15. Now we're in the 10,000's place. 1 plus 4 is 5. And 5 plus 1 is 6. And there's nothing to carry. Now we're in the 100,000's place. 3-- we have nothing to carry, so we just have the three 100,000's plus zero 100,000's. Well, that's just three 300,000. And then finally, we're in the millions place. 2,000,000 plus 7,000,000 is 9,000,000. Just like that. So this was a super crazy number. 2,349,015 plus 7,015,999. Just by keeping track of our places and carrying the two-digit numbers or the second digit in the two-digit numbers as necessary, we were able to figure out that the answer is 9,365,014. So hopefully this gives you a pretty good sense. And let me just do one more, just to really make sure that we really understand how all of this carrying business works. So let's do 15,999,001 plus 6,888,999. Let's just see how this one's going to turn out. This seems like a like a difficult problem. But once again, if we just focus and don't get lost, we're going to get the right answer hopefully. So 1 plus 9 is 10. Write the 0, carry the 1. 1 plus 0 plus 9 is 10. Write the 0, carry the 1. 1 plus 0 plus 9. That's 10 again. Write the 0, carry the 1. Now 1 plus 9 is 10, plus 8. 10 plus 8 is 18. Write the 8, carry the 1. 1 plus 9 is 10. Plus eight is 18. Write the 8, carry the 1. 1 plus 9 is 10. Plus 8 is 18. Write the 8, carry the 1. Now we're in the 1,000,000's place. 1,000,000 plus 5,000,000 is 6,000,000. Plus 6,000,000 is 12,000,000. Write the 200,000,000 and then carry the 1 because 12,000,000 is 2,000,000 plus 10,000,000. 10,000,000 plus 10,000,000. This is one 10,000,000 plus another one 10,000,000. That's 1 plus 1 is 2. And then we are done. 15,999,001 plus 6,888,999 is 22,888,000. So you just saw, we're just doing 7 and 8 digit number additions, but you could apply this-- if I had a number with 100 digits in it, you could do the exact same thing. You just have to start at the right, go each column by each column, and then if you end up with a two-digit answer when you add the two one-digit numbers, you just carry the 10's place. You just doing that and work your way left. And if you make no errors, you'll get the right answer.",math_arithmetic-home_addition-subtraction
"  You probably notice that whenever you have a cold your nose gets all stuffy and when your nose gets all stuffy with a bunch of stuff you're not able to taste things very well. So let's imagine that you're trying to eat a strawberry. So you're eating the strawberry. Normally it tastes really good and it goes in your mouth and as you're chewing the strawberry you're breaking down different cellular components and these cellular components release little molecules and these little molecules will travel through the back of your throat and some of them will actually come into your nose. And as you're chewing the strawberry you're actually smelling little molecules that are being released. You're actually using your sense of smell in conjunction with your sense of taste with your ability to taste the strawberry. And so if you knock out your sense of smell which is what happens when you have a cold. If your sense of smell is knocked out you're relying only on your sense of taste. And when you only rely on your sense of taste you're not able to taste things as well. Things don't taste as rich. So you can actually try this. Next time you're eating something just go ahead and close your nose and see if whatever it is you're eating tastes differently after you're no longer smelling anything. So hopefully this goes to show a little bit about why our sense of smell is important. Now we can definitely live without our sense of smell, but it does greatly enrich our everyday lives. Smell is also known as olfaction. Sometimes our sense of smell can be called our olfactory sense and we'll talk a little bit about how this word comes into play and a little bit of the anatomy later on. Let's go ahead and go into the anatomy of our olfactory system really quickly. If I again draw a profile of someone. Here's the nose, here's the mouth, and here's the chin. There is a nostril and this nostril basically is an opening to allow air and various odor molecules to come into the nose. There is actually a region that you can't see. This region is known as your olfactory epithelium. This region is the olfactory epithelium. Olfactory epithelium. So again, olfactory olfaction. Separating this olfactory epithelium from the brain because the brain actually sits up here. So we've got a little bit of the brain and it sits up here. So separating the brain from the olfactory epithelium in this nasal passage over here is a piece of bone known as the cribriform plate. So this little piece of bone is known as the cribriform plate. And sitting right above the cribriform plate is actually a little extension from the brain. So there's actually an extension that comes from the brain and it sits right above the cribriform plate. I'm drawing it here in purple and it looks like a little bulb and this is actually known as the olfactory bulb. So olfactory bulb. So again, olfaction, olfactory bulb, and the olfactory bulb is basically a bundle of nerves so it's actually one of the cranial nerves that exits the brain and so this bundle of nerves sends little projections through the cribriform plate into the olfactory epithelium. So this projection of nerves breaks off and branches off and there are thousands and thousands of cells sending little connections into the olfactory epithelium. So I'm only drawing a few of them over here, but there are thousands of these cells sending little connections into the olfactory epithelium and at the very end of each one of these little cells are receptors and each receptor is sensitive to one particular molecule. It's actually sensitive to one particular type of molecule. So for example let's imagine that we have a benzene ring and most things that have benzene rings are known as aromatic compounds and normally you can actually smell aromatic compounds. So a molecule has a benzene ring it usually has some sort of scent and that scent is picked up via the olfactory bulb and these little extensions that come into the olfactory epithelium. So we have a little benzene ring, A little odor molecule and it travels into the nose. It will actually bind to a small receptor on one of these nerve endings. So what I'm going to do next is zoom in into this region over here. I just want to look at the olfactory bulb and in particular I want to be able to look at each one of these little olfactory sensory neurons and their little projections that bind to various molecules in the environment. So what I'm going to do now is zoom into that little part that I highlighted earlier. And so we're just going to look at the olfactory bulb so let me just label this olfactory bulb. And as I mentioned before the olfactory bulb was separated from the nasal passage by something known as a cribriform plate. The cribriform plate is basically just bone and there are a bunch of little holes in the cribriform plate that basically allow the cells, these olfactory sensory cells to send projections to the olfactory bulb. So let's imagine that there's an olfactory sensory cell and it sends a little projection into the olfactory bulb. And so it sends a little projection and this cell is situated inside the olfactory epithelium and there are all kinds of other epithelial cells over here so I could just kind of draw those in. So there are all kinds of epithelial cells that basically secrete mucus and all kinds of things and these olfactory epithelial cells are situated in between the rest of the epithelial cells. And there are thousands of different types of epithelial cells and each type has a particular receptor. So let's say that this particular olfactory sensory cell is responsible, has a little receptor and this little receptor is sensitive to benzene rings. So as we have a benzene molecule enter the nose through the nostrils it enters the nasal passage and eventually will bounce into this receptor and when it binds to this receptor it will actually trigger a cascade of events that causes this cell to fire. This cell will fire an action potential and the action potential will actually end up here in the olfactory bulb and what we have is we actually have a whole bunch of olfactory sensory cells that are sensitive to the same molecule. So we have another one over here and it will actually synapse to the same place. So we got another olfactory sensory cell and this also is sensitive to this benzene molecule. So the benzene molecule comes in and activates a whole bunch of cells that have benzene receptors and all the cells that are sensitive to benzene will all fire an action potential to one particular location in the olfactory bulb and this particular location is known as a glomerulus. So glomerulus. And the glomerulus is basically we can think of it as a designation point for various sensory olfactory cells that are sensitive to the same molecule. So we could think of this glomerulus as a benzene glomerulus because all the cells that are sensitive to benzene will synapse over here. And what actually happens is they will synapse onto another cell type. So there is another cell and this is known as a mitral, so mitral or as a tufted cell. Tufted cell and this mitral/tufted cell will actually project to the brain. So the reason we have this type of organization is because it's a lot easier for one cell to send a projection to the brain then it would be for thousands of these cells to send a projection to the brain. So just to kind of go into this in a little bit more detail so what we can also have are other cell types. Let's imagine that there's this blue cell over here. And let's imagine that this blue cell is sensitive to 2 benzene rings that are connected to one another. So if we have 2 benzene rings that are connected to one another they will bind onto a receptor on this blue olfactory sensory cell and this blue cell will go through the cribriform plate and synapse in the olfactory bulb, but it will synapse at a different location as will other blue cells sensitive to double benzene rings and they will synapse onto a double benzene glomerulus and so on and so this double benzene glomerulus has a different mitral/tufted cell that will send a projection to the brain. So this is the general organization of various cells in the olfactory epithelium and the general idea here is that we have hundreds of various cells that are hypersensitive to one particular molecule and these hundreds of cells will all send all their projections to one glomerulus and that one glomerulus will have several 1mitral/tufted cells that will then go to the brain. 1So now what I want to go into is 1I just want to look at this part right here. 1So I want to look at how a molecule will bind 1to a receptor and how it triggers an action potential. 1So let's imagine that we have 1this molecule of benzene over here. 1So it will enter the nasal passage 1and it will bounce around until it binds 1to a particular receptor. 1So what we have is a particular receptor 1that is in the membrane of an olfactory sensory cell. 1So this benzene molecule will come in 1and it will bind right here. 1It will bind and when it binds it will actually cause 1this receptor which is known as 1a G protein-coupled receptor 1and it's called a G protein-coupled receptor 1because there's actually a protein inside 1that is known as a G protein which it is coupled to. 1It's coupled, sorry ie. The G-protein is coupled to the 1receptor and when the molecule of benzene binds 1it will actually cause disassociation here. 1The G protein will break away 1and it will cause a cascade of events inside the cell. 1So this inside one of the sensory olfactory cells 1that we were talking about earlier. 1And so one of the effects that this G protein will have 1is it will actually bind to an ion channel. 1So it will bind to an ion channel 1and the ion channel will basically allow 1positive ions from outside the cell to flow inside 1and this will cause the cell to depolarize 1and fire an action potential that eventually 1will go through the cribriform plate 1and then synapse to a mitral/tufted cell 1and that mitral/tufted cell will send 1a synapse to the brain. 1So let's just go over everything that we talked about 1really quickly. 1We have an odor molecule which is a benzene ring, 1in this example, will bind to a GPCR. 1So this GPCR is a particular odor receptor 1and the G protein. 1So the G protein-coupled receptor, 1the G protein will actually break away. 1The G protein breaks away 1and activates various things inside the cell 1and one of those things is 1an ion channel gets activated. 1That causes the cell to depolarize 1and fire an action potential 1and the action potential will go through 1the cribriform plate and into the glomerulus 1and it will activate a mitral/tufted cell 1which will then enter the brain 1and then your brain is able to perceive that odor 1through this pathway over here.",science_health-and-medicine_nervous-system-and-sensory-infor
" Right here I have graphed part of the graph of y is equal to 1/x. And what I'm curious about is the area under this curve and above the x-axis between x equals 1 and infinity. So I want to figure out this area right over here. So let's try to do it. So we could set this up as an improper integral going from 1 to infinity of 1/x dx. Well once again-- actually, let me do that same yellow color. I like that more-- we can view this as the limit as n approaches infinity of the integral from 1 to n of 1/x dx, which we can write as the limit as n approaches infinity of the antiderivative of 1/x, which is the natural log of the absolute value of x. So this is going to be the natural log of the absolute value of x. And the absolute value of x won't really matter so much. We could just say x because we're dealing with positive values of x. But I'll just write it down as the natural log of the absolute value of x between x is 1 and x is n. And so this is going to be equal to the limit as n approaches infinity of-- you evaluate this at n, so you're going to get the natural log-- I could write the absolute value of n, but we know that n is going to be positive. So we could just write the natural log of n minus the natural log of the absolute value of 1, or the natural log of 1. Natural log of 1 is just a 0. e to the 0-th power is equal to 1. So this boils down to the limit as n approaches infinity of the natural log of n. Now this is interesting. Natural log function just keeps getting larger and larger and larger. The natural log function keeps growing and growing and growing like this, albeit at a slower and slower pace, but it keeps growing. The limit as n approaches infinity of the natural log of n is just equal to infinity. So here we do not have a finite area. This is an infinite. This is an infinite area. It's interesting. When this function decreased faster-- when it was 1 over x squared-- we had a finite area. Now we have an infinite area. And so we would say that this integral right over here, this improper integral, is divergent. And we're done.",math_calculus-2_cs2-integration-techniques
" I have a little simulation here that saves us time. It does the random picking for us. Mm-hmm. And it allows me to start with four whites and two blacks, and I'm going to have the computer do many selections for us. So, this is every selection the computer's doing, the equivalent of randomly picking out a marble. It's shaking it and randomly picking it, and you see that now the percentage of white, it's getting pretty close to the actual percentage, or a 4:2 ratio, I should say, of white to black. So, I think I believe you now, because at the beginning, I see a lot of variation- Right. On this graph over time, and now it's kind of flat-lining. It's definitely, it feels like it's converging to the actual proportion, and once again, there's some chance that it didn't. We could have, it could have been just one of those one in a quadrillion circumstances (laughs) where you just kept picking a white every time, but this is consistent with the intuition, as the more trials you have, it just becomes harder and harder, the probability of it being a significant departure from the actual proportion becomes lower.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_math-warmup
" We've already seen that if we take a whole, and in this example, the whole is this entire green circle. And if we were to split it into 5 equal sections-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So we've split it into 5 equal sections-- and if we were to select 1 of those 5 equal sections. So let's say we select this section right over here, that we have selected 1/5 of the whole, 1 out of the 5 equal sections. We could do the exact same thing on a number line. Everything we've been doing so far has to deal with shapes, but we could do the exact same idea on a number line. So let me draw a number line here. So let me draw it pretty big so we get a sense of things. So it will go all the way to there. And let's say that this is 0, this is 1, and this is 2. And of course, we could keep going if we had more space to 3, 4, and on and on and on. And what I want to do, instead of taking a circle and dividing it into 5 equal sections, I want to take the section of our number line between 0 and 1 and divide it into 5 equal sections. So let me see if I can do this. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. That looks pretty good. I'm drawing it as exact as I can with my hand. But let's just assume these are 5 equal sections. So what would you think would be a good label for this number right over here? Well, it's the exact same idea. Between 0 and 1, I've traveled 1 out of the 5 equal sections towards 1. And actually, let me make it a little bit neater than that. We could make the equal sections look a little bit better. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And what we're thinking about is this. What should we call this number here? This number is clearly between 0 and 1. It's clearly closer to 0. And we've gone 1 out of the 5 equal sections towards 1. Well, it makes complete sense that, look, we had 5 equal sections here. And we've traveled 1 of them towards 1. So we should call this number right over here 1/5. So when we're talking about a fraction, 1/5, it's not just talking about, hey, what part of a pizza pie have I eaten or something like that. This is actually a number. This is a number. And we can actually plot it on the number line. Now you might say, OK, well, that's fair about 1/5. But what about all these other slashes? What numbers would we call that? Well, we can make the exact same idea. If up here, instead of shading in 1 out of the 5 equal sections, if I shaded in 2 of the 5 equal sections, then I wouldn't say this is 1/5 any more. I would say that this 2/5. And so if I go 2 of the equal sections towards 1, then I should call this number right over here 2/5. And I could keep going. This right over here should be 3, 3/5. This right over here, I've gone 1, 2, 3, 4 out of the 5 sections towards 1. So I could call this 4/5. And I could keep going. I could call this right over here-- I've traveled 5 out of the 5 equal sections towards 5, so I could call this right over here 5. Let me do it in that red color. I could call this right over here 5/5. You might say, wait, but 5/5, we've gotten to 1. And that's exactly right. If I were to shade in 5 things over here-- let me do that little bit cleaner. That's not the color I want to use. If I were to shade in 5 things over here, we've already seen that shading in 5 things-- let me make this a little bit neater-- if this is now 5 over 5 or 5/5, we've already seen that this is a whole. And over here, if we've traveled 5/5 of the way towards 1, we've gotten to the whole 1. 5/5 is the exact same thing as 1. It is equal to a whole.",math_arithmetic_fraction-arithmetic
" -  What we have here are a few data analysis questions in a biology context from the New York Regents Exam, but these are useful example problems if you're studying high school biology in general because they might show up in some type of an exam that your teacher gives you or you might see on a standardized test. A student proposes that, if volunteers warm up before squeezing a clothespin for one minute, they will increase the number of times that they can squeeze it within tiring. He states that this is because their muscles will be better prepared for the exercise. The data from an experiment are shown in the data table below. Which trial from the chart above provides the best data to support his claim? Support your answer. So, pause this video and see if you could answer it. So, let's just make sure we understand what's going on here. So, there's two trials. This is the first trial, trial one, right over here, and in trial one, you had two groups of 10 students. One of them did warm up and the other 10 did not warm up, and then in trial two, you had two more groups and this time, they were groups of 25. Once again, 25 who did warm up and 25 who didn't warm up. Now, in trial one, the group that warmed up actually had a lower number of average squeezes, so this goes against the hypothesis that the student had. The hypothesis the student has is if they warm up beforehand that you would actually be able to do more squeezes, so trial one actually goes against the student's claim. Trial two seems to slightly go in favor of the student's claim. The group that warmed up was able to eke out a few more. Now, we haven't done the statistical analysis to know how probable this is, if it was due purely to random chance, but just to answer that question, one, the data goes, trial one goes a little bit against the student's claim. Trial two best supports this claim, although it doesn't do it so strongly. So, I would say trial two and that is because the 25 that warmed, warmed up, that is group three, group three, were able, on average, on average, to squeeze more in a minute, to squeeze more in the minute than group four that didn't warm up. Alright, let's do another question here. So, here we're told, students were asked to design a lab that investigated the relationship between exercise and heart rate. Heart rate was determined by recording the pulse rate in beats per minute. The students hypothesized that increased exercise results in an increased heart rate. The class results for the experiment are shown in the graph below. And then they say, which statement is best supported by this graph? And we're given four choices. So, pause this video and see if you could answer this on your own. Alright, now let's go through statement by statement. Statement one, before exercising, the average pulse rate was 65. Four minutes after exercising, the average pulse rate was 65. So, let's see. Before exercising, the average pulse rate was 65. So, before exercising, this is time period right over here and it does look like over most of that time period, let me do this in red, it does look like that is reasonably, that is roughly true. It looks like the average pulse rate was 65, but now let's read the second part of the statement. Four minutes after exercising, the average pulse rate was 65 as well. Four minutes after exercising, what's the average pulse rate? Well, it sure isn't 65, it looks closer to being, maybe, 135, not 65, so we could rule this one out. After four minutes of exercising, the average pulse rate was 120. Let's see. So, this is when the exercise starts. After four minutes, the average pulse rate was 120. No, it looks like it was like 135 or something like this, so this is already looking fishy. Two minutes after exercising, the average pulse rate was 120. So, two minutes after exercising, the average pulse rate actually seems closer to about 90, so both of those look fishy, I'll rule that one out. While exercising, the average, the highest average pulse rate was 150. Before exercising, the average pulse rate was 65. So, let's see, while exercising, the highest average pulse rate happens right over there and that does indeed look pretty close to 150, so this part's looking good. Before exercising, the average pulse rate was 65. Yeah, we already talked about this period right over here. So, this is looking good, I'm liking this choice, but let's see choice four. Two minutes before exercising, the average pulse rate was 80. So, two minutes before exercising, this is when we start exercising and each of these hash marks is a minute, so two minutes before, the average pulse rate was not 80, so that's false. After two minutes of exercise, the average pulse rate was 140. After two minutes, the average pulse rate was also not 140, so both of those statements are not correct. So, I like statement three, that's the one that seems to be backed up by the data here.",science_high-school-biology_hs-biology-foundations
" We're asked how many toothpicks will be needed to form the 50th figure in this sequence? And they've drawn the first four figures in the sequence. This is the first, the second, the third. Now, let's see what's happening here. So in this first figure, we have this nice little house that they've made out of toothpicks, and it has one, two, three, four, five, six toothpicks. So the first figure in our sequence has six toothpicks. Now, what happens in the second figure here? Well, it looks just like our first figure. We have our one, two, three, four, five, six toothpicks, but then they add some toothpicks. It looks like they added one, two, three, four, five, toothpicks. So it's 6 plus 5 or 11 toothpicks. So let me write this down. It is the 6 toothpicks plus 5 more, which is equal to 11 toothpicks. And then when we go to the third figure, it looks just like the second figure, so it has the 11 toothpicks, so the 11 toothpicks are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, just like the second figure. And then they add some more. They add one, two, three, four, five. So it looks like every time, when you draw part of a another house, because it can share a wall with the previous house or share a toothpick with the previous set of houses, you add five toothpicks. So for the third term in our sequence, we had 11 and when we had our second term, or our two houses, and then we add five more. So to our 50th term, so 11 plus 5 is going to be 16. And then for the fourth term, it's going to be 16 plus 5, which is equal to 21. Now, there's a couple of ways to think about it. You can think about however many more you are than 1. So let's say you are in the nth term of the sequence. If you are in the nth term, however more you are than 1, so if you're the nth term, you're going to be n minus 1 more than 1. If that is confusing, we'll do it with real numbers, so it gets a little bit more tangible. So the nth term, you are n minus 1 more or greater than-- I'll just say more-- than 1. For example, if n is 2, you are 1 more than 1. If n is 3, you are 3 minus 1, which is 2 more than 1. So however much more you are than 1, you multiply that by 5. We're 2 more than 1, so we add 10 to the number of toothpicks we have here. We're 3 more than 1 here, so we add 15 to the number of toothpicks we have there. So you could say that for the nth term, the number of toothpicks is equal to the number you're more than 1, < n minus 1 times 5. That's how much you're going to add above and beyond the amount of toothpicks in just the first sequence, so times 5. n minus 1 times 5 plus the number of toothpicks that you would just have in the first sequence or just this one house. And we already counted that: plus 6. So that's one way to think about it. And if this looks complicated, you just say, well, look, if I put a 4 here, I'm 3 more than 1, so 4 minus 1 is 3, so that'll be 3 times 5, which is 15. And then you add the number of toothpicks in 1 and then you get 6. Now another way, and many of you all might find this easier to think about, is even in 1, you could imagine a term here-- let me do it this way. You can imagine a term here that they didn't draw. You can imagine a 0th term. Let me just draw it here. Imagine a 0th term, and the 0th term would just be kind of a left wall of the house, or in this case, the left toothpick of a house. And then the first one, you're adding 5 toothpicks to that. In the second one, you're adding 5 toothpicks to that. And when you think about it this way, it actually becomes a little simpler to think in terms of n. Here, you could say, well, the nth term-- let me do this in a different color. You could say that the nth term is going to have-- or maybe we should say number of toothpicks in nth figure is going to be equal to 1. So in the 0th figure, which I just made up, you have at least 1 toothpick, and then whatever term in the sequence you are, you multiply that times 5 and you add that to the number of toothpicks in the 0th figure, so it's 1 plus 5 times n, which is actually a simpler way to think about. The first figure is going to be that 1 in the 0th figure plus 5: 6 toothpicks. Even in the 0th figure, it works out. If you put a 0 here, 0 plus 1 is 1. If you put the fourth figure here, 5 times 4 is 20 plus 1 is 21. Now let's answer their question. We need to figure out the toothpicks in the 50th figure in the sequence. Well, we just put 50 for n here. So for the 50th figure, we could use either formula. We have 1 plus 5 times 50. 5 times 50 is 250 plus 1 is equal to 251. And now I said you could use either formula because they should reduce to each other, if we did our math right or if we deduced properly. So this one up here, let's just verify this is the same thing as this over here. If we multiply 5 times n minus 1, we get 5n minus 5, right? We just distributed the 5. And then we have that plus 6. Negative 5 plus 6 is plus 1. So it's 5n plus 1 or 1 plus 5n. Either way, your 50th figure is going to have 251.",math_algebra-home_alg-series-and-induction
" In the last video we saw why when we take any non-zero number divided by zero why mathematicians have left that as being undefined. But it might have raised a question in your brain. What about zero divided by zero? Isn't there an argument why that could be defined? So we're gonna think about zero divided by zero. Well there's a couple of lines of reasoning here. One, you could start taking numbers closer and closer to zero and dividing them by themselves. So for example, you take 0.1 divided by 0.1. Well that's gonna be one. Let's get even closer to zero: 0.001 divided by 0.001. Well, that also equals one. Let's get super close to zero: 0.000001 divided by 0.000001. Well once again, that also equals one. And it didn't even matter whether these were positive or negative. I could make these negative and I'd still get the same result. Negative this thing divided by negative this thing still gets me to one. So based on this logic you might say, ""Hey, well this seems like a pretty reasonable argument for zero divided by zero to be defined as being equal to one. "" But someone could come along and say, ""Well what happens if we divide zero by numbers closer and closer to zero; not a number by itself, but zero by smaller and smaller numbers, or numbers closer and closer to zero."" And so they say, ""For example, zero divided by 0.1, well that's just going to be zero. Zero divided by 0.001, well that's also going to be to zero. 0 divided by 0.000001 is also going to be equal to zero."" And it didn't matter whether we were dividing by a positive or negative number. Make all of these negatives, you still get the same answer. So this line of reasoning tells you that it's completely legitimate, to think at least that maybe zero divided by zero could be equal to zero. And these are equally valid arguments. And because they're equally valid, and frankly neither of them is consistent with the rest of mathematics, once again mathematicians have left zero divided by zero as undefined.",math_math1_algebra-foundation
" -  Talk about the main types of statistical studies. So you can have a sample study and we've already talked about this in several videos but we'll go over it again in this one. You can have an observational study, observational study. Or you can have an experiment, experiment. So let's go through each of these and always pause this video and see if you can think about what these words likely mean, or you might already know. Well, sample study, we have looked at. This is really where you're trying to estimate the value of a parameter for a population. So what's an example of that? So let's say we take the population of people in a city, and so that could be hundreds of thousands of people, and the parameter that you care about is how much time on average do they spend on a computer. So the parameter would be for the entire population. If it was possible, you would go talk to every, maybe there's a million people in the city. You would talk to all million of those people and ask them how much time they spend on a computer and you would get the average and then that would be the parameter. So population parameter, population parameter, would be average time on a computer per day, average daily time, time on a computer. Now you'd determine that it's impractical to go talk to everyone, so you're not going to be able to figure out the exact population parameter, average daily time on a computer, so instead, you do a sample study. You randomly sample, and there's a lot of thought in thinking about whether your sample is truly random, so you randomly sample and there's also different techniques of randomly sampling. So you randomly sample people from your population and then you take the average daily time on a computer for your sample, and that is going to be an estimate for the population parameter. So that's your classic sample study. Now in an observational study, you're not trying to estimate a parameter. You're trying to understand how two parameters in a population might move together or not. So let's say that you have a population now, so let's say you have a population of, let's say you have a population of 1,000 people. 1,000 people, and you're curious about whether average daily time on a computer, how it relates to people's blood pressure. So average computer time, oh, I shouldn't be writing this way. Instead of average computer time, it should just be computer time. Computer time versus blood pressure, blood pressure. So what you do is you apply a survey to all 1,000 people and you ask them how much time you spend on a computer and what is your blood pressure? Or maybe you measure it in some way, and then you plot it all, you look at the data and you see if those two variables move together. So what does that mean? Well, let me draw. If this axis is, let's say this is computer time. Computer time, and this axis is blood pressure. Blood pressure. So let's say that there's one person who doesn't spend a lot of time on a computer and they have a relatively low blood pressure. There's another person who spends a lot of time, has high blood pressure. There could be someone who doesn't spend much time on a computer but has a reasonably high blood pressure, but you keep doing this and you get all these data points for those 1,000 people, and I'm not going to sit here and draw 1,000 points, but you see something like this, and so you see, hey, look, it looks like there's definitely some outliers but it looks like these two variables move together. It looks like, in general, the more computer time, the higher the blood pressure, or the higher the blood pressure, the more computer time. And so you can make a conclusion here about these two variables correlating, that they're positively correlated. There is a positive, a reasonable conclusion if you did the study appropriately would be that more computer time correlates with higher blood pressure or that higher blood pressure correlates with more computer time. Now, when you do these observational studies or when you interpret these observational studies, when you read someone else's, it's very important not to say oh, well, this shows me that computer time causes blood pressure, because this is not showing causality, and you also can't say, maybe you might say, somehow blood pressure causes more people to spend time in front of a computer. That seems even a little bit sillier, but they're actually the same 'cause all you're saying is that there's a correlation. These two variables move together. You can't make a conclusion about causality, that computer time causes blood pressure or that high blood pressure causes more computer time. Why can't you make that? Well, there could be what's called a confounding variable, sometimes called a lurking variable, where let's say that, so this is computer time. Computer time, and this is blood pressure. Looks like building, so blood, blood pressure. And it looks like these two things move together. We saw that right over here in our data, but there could be a root variable that drives both of these, a confounding variable, and that could just be the amount of physical activity someone has. So there could just be a lack of physical activity driving both, lack of activity. People who are less active spend more time in front of a computer, and people who are less active have higher blood pressure, and if you were to control for this, if you were to take a bunch of people who had a similar lack of activity or had a similar level of activity, you might see that computer time does not correlate with blood pressure, that these are just both driven by the same thing and what you're really seeing here is like, okay, people who aren't active drives both of these variables. So once again, when you do this observational study and if you do it well, you can draw correlations and that might give you decent hypotheses for causality, but this does not show causality because you could have these confounding variables. Now, experiments, and experiments are the basis of the scientific method. Experiments are all about trying to establish causality, and so what you would do is if you wanted to do an experiment, you would take, and you probably wouldn't be able to do it with 1,000 people. Experiments in some ways are the hardest to do of all of these. Maybe you take 100 people, 100 people, and to avoid having this confounding variable introduce error into your experiment, you randomly assign these hundred people to two groups. So random assign, it's very important that they're randomly assigned. And that's nice, you might not know all of the confounding variables there, but it makes it likely that each group will have a same amount of people with lack of activity or the activity levels on average in each of the groups, when they're randomly assigned, it gives you a better chance that one group doesn't have a significantly different activity level than the other. And then what you do is you have a control group and you have a treatment group. Once again, you've randomly assigned them. So a control and then treatment. And what you might say is, okay, for some amount of time, all of you in the control group can only spend max of 30 minutes in front of a computer, or maybe if you really wanted to do it, you'd say you have to spend exactly 30 minutes on a computer and that's maybe a little unrealistic, and then the treatment group, you have to say, you have to spend exactly two hours in front of a computer, and I'm making up these numbers at random, and it would be nice to see, okay, what as everyone's blood pressure before the experiment? And you'd say, okay, well, the averages are similar going into the experiment, and then you go some amount of time and you measure blood pressure, and if you see that, wow, this group definitely has a higher blood pressure, this group has a higher blood pressure, so the blood pressure is higher here, and once again, some of this might have just happened randomly, it might've been the people you happened to put in there, et cetera, et cetera, but depending if this was a large enough experiment and you conducted it well, this says, hey, look, I'm feeling like there is a causality here, that by making these people spend more time in front of a computer, that that actually raised their blood pressure. So once again, sample study, you're trying to estimate a population parameter. Observation study, you are seeing if there is a correlation between two things and you have to be careful not to say, hey, one is causing the other 'cause you could have confounding variables. Experiment, you're trying to establish or show causality and you do that by taking your group, randomly assigning to a control or treatment. 1That should evenly or hopefully evenly distribute. 1Not always, there's some chance it doesn't, 1but distribute the confounding variables 1and then on each group, you change how much 1of one of these variables they get 1and you see if it drives the other variable. 1So anyway, in the next two videos, 1we'll do some examples of identifying 1these types of sample studies 1and thinking about what we can conclude from them, 1or these types of statistical studies 1and see what we can conclude from them.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-4
" So we've explicitly defined four different sequences here. And what I want you to think about is whether these sequences converge or diverge. And remember, converge just means, as n gets larger and larger and larger, that the value of our sequence is approaching some value. And diverge means that it's not approaching some value. So let's look at this. And I encourage you to pause this video and try this on your own before I'm about to explain it. So let's look at this first sequence right over here. So the numerator n plus 8 times n plus 1, the denominator n times n minus 10. So one way to think about what's happening as n gets larger and larger is look at the degree of the numerator and the degree of the denominator. And we care about the degree because we want to see, look, is the numerator growing faster than the denominator? In which case this thing is going to go to infinity and this thing's going to diverge. Or is maybe the denominator growing faster, in which case this might converge to 0? Or maybe they're growing at the same level, and maybe it'll converge to a different number. So let's multiply out the numerator and the denominator and figure that out. So n times n is n squared. n times 1 is 1n, plus 8n is 9n. And then 8 times 1 is 8. So the numerator is n squared plus 9n plus 8. The denominator is n squared minus 10n. And one way to think about it is n gets really, really, really, really, really large, what dominates in the numerator-- this term is going to represent most of the value. And this term is going to represent most of the value, as well. These other terms aren't going to grow. Obviously, this 8 doesn't grow at all. But the n terms aren't going to grow anywhere near as fast as the n squared terms, especially for large n's. So for very, very large n's, this is really going to be approaching n squared over n squared, or 1. So it's reasonable to say that this converges. So this one converges. And once again, I'm not vigorously proving it here. Or I should say I'm not rigorously proving it over here. But the giveaway is that we have the same degree in the numerator and the denominator. So now let's look at this one right over here. So here in the numerator I have e to the n power. And here I have e times n. So this grows much faster. I mean, this is e to the n power. Imagine if when you have this as 100, e to the 100th power is a ginormous number. e times 100-- that's just 100e. Grows much faster than this right over here. So this thing is just going to balloon. This is going to go to infinity. So we could say this diverges. Now let's look at this one right over here. Well, we have a higher degree term. We have a higher degree in the numerator than we have in the denominator. n squared, obviously, is going to grow much faster than n. So for the same reason as the b sub n sequence, this thing is going to diverge. The numerator is going to grow much faster than the denominator. Or another way to think about it, the limit as n approaches infinity is going to be infinity. This thing's going to go to infinity. Now let's think about this right over here. So as we increase n-- so we could even think about what the sequence looks like. When n is 0, negative 1 to the 0 is 1. When n is 1, it's going to be negative 1. When n is 2, it's going to be 1. And so this thing is just going to keep oscillating between negative 1 and 1. So it's not unbounded. It's not going to go to infinity or negative infinity or something like that. But it just oscillates between these two values. So it doesn't converge to one particular value. So even though this one isn't unbounded-- it doesn't go to infinity-- this one still diverges. It doesn't go to one value. So let me write that down. This one diverges.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-series
" -  So if you're in a room of some kind I encourage you to try a little experiment right now. So look around the room and see if there's something in the room that's made out of wood, or maybe paper, or cloth, and it's been in the room for some time, so hopefully it has the temperature of the room. And then find something else that's made out of metal that's also been sitting in the room for awhile and it doesn't have its own source of energy, so don't use your computer. It should just be something that's been passively sitting in that room for awhile, it's not too hard to find, and touch them both. And what you will see, is that even though they've both been sitting in that room for awhile, the metal is going to feel a lot colder. The metal is going to feel colder. And this is a bit of a conundrum because they've both been sitting in this room for a while, so they both should take on the ambient temperature. So let's make this a little bit more concrete. Let's say that the temperature of the room is 70 degrees fahrenheit. And the key for this feeling colder, is that the ambient temperature of the room is less than your body temperature. Your body temperature is going to be roughly 98.6 degrees fahrenheit. So let me write this, this is body temperature. And the temperature at the surface of your skin might be a little bit different than this, but let's just assume that it's roughly 98.6 degrees fahrenheit. And so, what's happening is, this metal one, this metal surface, isn't actually colder. It doesn't actually have a lower average kinetic energy than the wood surface. They've both been sitting in this room for a while, they're both going to have the ambient temperature of 70 degrees fahrenheit. So what just happened? Why, to your skin, and to your brain, does the metal actually feel colder? And the simple answer is, it's better at taking the heat away from you. So why is it better at taking the heat away from me? Well, let's just imagine, let's say that these here are the atoms on the surface of my skin. So these are the atoms on the surface of my skin, the bottom of my skin, let's just say my hand is touching a surface like this. That's my thumb right over there, and I'm touching the surface. And it's going to have an average kinetic energy that would be in relation to a body temperature of 98.6 degrees fahrenheit. So these things are going to bounce around, or vibrate around. And maybe the covalent bonds between the carbon atoms and the other atoms on my skin that keeps them from breaking free fully, but they're going to be kind of oscillating around, bouncing around a little bit. And they'll even kind of push on each other, and this could be kind of the electrostatic forces doing it. But they're going to have some average kinetic energy. And let's say my hand is touching both of these surfaces at the same time. So I have the wood surface, I'll do that in yellow. So I have the wood surface, right over there. That is wood. And I have the metal surface, I'll do that in white. So I have the metal surface, right over here. And this metal surface, we already talked about, is going to feel colder. Let me draw the rest of my hand, actually. So the rest of my arm, you get the idea. So what's going on here. So let's just think about it at a microscopic level. So the wood, first of all, its surface is going to be uneven. So you're going to have atoms up here, but then you're going to have gaps, there's going to be air here. Let me actually scroll down a little bit. So it's going to be like this, so you're going to have gaps like that. And it also has internal gaps, like that. So this would be the wood, while the metal is much denser. And the surface is actually much smoother. So the metal, let me do the metal in that white color, the metal atoms are much more closely packed. It is much denser, the surface is smoother, it won't have any internal air pockets, it's not going to have any internal air pockets in it. And so what's going to happen? Well, we've always said, you're going to have a transfer of heat from the higher temperature system, or the higher temperature thing, to the lower temperature thing. And so, they're already going to have some kinetic energy, these things are going to have an average kinetic energy that's consistent with 70 degrees fahrenheit. So, let me just draw a couple of these arrows. Same thing over here, they're going to have the same average kinetic energy. So these things are all jostling around, bouncing around and pushing on each other with the electrostatic forces. So, hopefully this gives you an idea of things. But, my hand is warmer, my hand has a higher average kinetic energy. And so the atoms and molecules of my hand are going to bounce into the atoms and molecules of the wood, and they're going to transfer the kinetic energy. But we realize in the wood is, I'm making less contact. Because, first of all, the surface of the wood isn't smooth, so I'm making less contact. So this one over here might just bump into another air particle, it actually won't bump into a wood particle. But some of the wood particles will start to take some of the kinetic energy away from me. And I will sense that as being a little bit cool, so maybe that takes a little kinetic energy, that bumps into this guy. So the kinetic energy does get transferred down. But it's going to be transferred down a lot slower than what would happen in the metal. Because, one, I don't have as much surface contact between my hand and the wood, because of these gaps. I also have air pockets in the wood, like this. And in general, the wood is less dense. So, there's going to be less collisions and it's going to take more time for that kinetic energy to be transferred away from my hand. And the metal, on the other hand, as soon as this atom bumps into this one, that's going to bump into that one, that's going to bump into that one, that's going to bump into that one. And that kinetic energy is going to be very quickly transferred down the metal. So it's going to be able to take more heat away from me. So this molecule over here is going to get some kinetic energy from a molecule in my hand. But then, it's going to bump into it's neighbor and transfer that kinetic energy. So it's going to lose it's kinetic energy quite quickly, and so it's ready to be bumped into again by another molecule from my hand, and take on more kinetic energy. So it's going to sap the heat away from me faster. So you have faster heat transfer, than you have with the wood. And, from your body's point of view, this heat being sapped away from you faster, even though the two surfaces are actually the same temperature, you perceive this, your body perceives this right over here as being colder.",science_ap-physics-2_ap-thermodynamics
" -  In the figure above, triangle ABC is isosceles. So that's triangle ABC. So that big triangle, that's isosceles, which means two of its sides are congruent, have the same length. That is side AB, they explain it here, side AB, so side AB here is equal in length to side BC. So these two sides are equal, equal in length. So we could say that that side is equal to that side. Actually, I wanna be careful, just because that looks like I'm saying that from that point to that point, but those two blue sides are gonna be equal in length. Triangle DEF, DEF, overlaps with triangle ABC. Yeah, we see that, they kinda form this Star of David, or kinda this skewed Star of David. What is the value of angle p here? All right, let's work through this. So ABC is an isosceles triangle, and I'm gonna draw it separately here. So ABC is an isosceles triangle. This is an isosceles triangle. And an isosceles triangle if these two, if these two sides are congruent, then these base angles are going to be congruent. And they already tell us that this angle up here, they already tell us that this angle up here is 100 degrees, and we know that all the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So if we call, if we call this x degrees, and then this is x degrees, then we see that x plus x plus 100, plus 100, is going to need to be equal to 180. Or we can get that two x, two x, and then if we subtract 100 from both sides, is equal to 80, or that x is equal to 40 degrees. So just like that, we're able to figure out that both of these, both of these are going to be equal to 40 degrees. And that came straight out of the fact that ABC is an isosceles triangle. These two base angles are going to be congruent. So this is 40 degrees and this is 40 degrees. Now, now let's go to this little small triangle right over here, this little small triangle right over here. Once again, we know that the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So if this right over here, actually this angle right over here is going to be the same as p, because it's vertical. It's a vertical angle with p. So this is going to be p degrees as well. And now, we see p plus 40, p plus 40 plus 60, plus 60, is going to add up to 180 degrees. That's the interior angles of this little small triangle right over here. Or, we could write p plus, if we add the 40 and the 60, you get 100, p plus 100 is equal to 180. If we subtract 100 from both sides, we get p is equal to 80 degrees. So what is the value of p, or I guess this is p degrees? So the value of p is, the value of p is 80.",math_8th-engage-ny_engage-8th-module-2
" -  Let's solve some more of these systems problems. If you remember, there's a hard way to do this, and an easy way to do this. The hard way is to solve Newton's second law for each box individually, and then combine them, and you get two equations with two unknowns, you try your best to solve the algebra without losing any sins, but let's be honest, it usually goes wrong. So, the easy way to do this, the way to get the magnitude of the acceleration of the objects in your system, that is to say, if I wanna know the magnitude at which this five kilogram box accelerates, or that this three kilogram box accelerates, all I need to do is take the net external force that tries to make my system go, and then I divide by my total mass of my system. This is a quick way to get what the magnitude of the acceleration is of the objects in my system, but it's good to note, it'll only work if the objects in your system are required to move with the same magnitude of acceleration. And in this case they are, what I have here is a five kilogram mass tied to a rope, and that rope passes over a pulley, pulls over and connects to this three kilogram mass so that if this five kilogram mass has some acceleration downward, this three kilogram mass has to be accelerating upward at the same rate, otherwise this rope would break or snap or stretch, and we're assuming that that doesn't happen. So this rope is the condition that requires the fact that this rope doesn't break is what allows us to say that the system is just a single, big total mass with external forces exerted on it. So how would we solve this? I'd just say that, well, what are the external forces? Keep in mind, external forces are forces that are exerted on the objects in our system from objects outside of our system. So one external force would just be the force of gravity on this five kilogram mass. So I'm gonna have a force of gravity this way, and that force of gravity is just going to be equal to five kilograms times 9.8 meters per second squared, because that's how we find the force of gravity. Should I make it positive or negative? Well, this five kilogram is gonna be the one that's pulling downward, so if the question is, I hold these masses and I let go, what's the acceleration? This five kilogram mass is gonna accelerate downward, it's gonna drive the system forward. That's the force making the system go, so I'm gonna make that a positive force. And then I figure out, are there any other forces making this system go? No, there are not. You might say, well what about this tension over here? Isn't the tension on this three kilogram mass? Isn't that tension making this system go? Not really, because that's an internal force exerted between the objects in our system and internal forces are always opposed by another internal force. This tension will be pulling the three kilogram, trying to make it move, but it opposes the motion of the five kilogram mass, and if we think of this three plus five kilogram mass as a single object, these end up just canceling on our single object that we're viewing as one big eight kilogram mass. So those are internal forces. We don't include them, they're not part of this trick. We have to figure out what other forces would try to make this system go or try to prevent it from moving. Another force that tries to prevent it from moving is the force of gravity on the three kilogram mass. Or, one force that tries to prevent the system from moving would be this force of gravity. How big is that? That's three kilograms times 9.8 meters per second squared. And that's trying to prevent the system from moving. This five kilogram mass is accelerating downward, and this force is in the opposite direction of motion. That trips people out sometimes. They're like, I don't understand, they're both pointing down. Shouldn't they have the same sign? They would when we're using Newton's second law the way we usually use it, but when we're using this trick, what we're concerned with are forces in the direction of motion, this is an easy way to figure it out, forces in the direction of motion we're gonna call positive. And any forces opposite the direction of motion we're gonna call negative. So, forces that propel the system forward we'll just call that positive direction. Forces that resist the motion, we're just gonna call that the negative direction. And since this is on this side of the motion of the system, this system is, everything in this system is going this way. The three kilogram mass goes up. The string over here goes up. The string up here goes to the right. The string right here goes down. The five kilogram mass goes down. Because all the motion in the system is this way, we'd find that way's positive, but this force of gravity on the three kilogram mass is the opposite direction. It's opposing the motion of the system. It's preventing the system from accelerating as fast as it would have. That's why we subtract it. And now we just divide by the total mass. And the total mass is just five plus three, is gonna be eight kilograms, and I get the acceleration of my system. So if I just add this up, I get 2.45 meters per second squared. So this is a really fast way to get what the acceleration of our system is, but you have to be careful. If the question is, what's the acceleration of a five kilogram box? Well, technically, that acceleration of the five kilogram box would be negative 2.45. What we really found here, since we were just finding the magnitude, was the size of the acceleration, since this five kilogram box is accelerating down, and we usually treat down as negative. You won't wanna forget that negative in putting in that answer the acceleration of the three kilogram box, however, would be positive 2.45 meters per second squared. So when you're applying this to an individual box, you have to be very careful and make sure that you apply that acceleration with the correct sign for that particular box. And if you wanted to find the tension now, now it's easy to find the tension. I could find this tension right here if I wanted to. If the next step was find the tension in the string connected to the boxes, now I can just use Newton's second law, but the way we always use it. I'm done with the trick. The trick is just the way to get the magnitude of the acceleration. Now that I have that, I'm done treating it as a system or a single object. I'll look at this single five kilogram mass all alone, and I'll say that the acceleration of the five kilogram mass, which is Newton's second law, is gonna equal the net force on the five kilogram mass divided by the mass of the five kilogram mass. I know the acceleration of the five kilogram mass, but if I'm gonna treat up as positive now, I gotta plug this acceleration in with a negative sign. So negative 2.45 meters per second squared is gonna equal the net force on the five kilogram mass. I've got tension up, you might be like, wait, we said that was an internal force. It was an internal force, and we didn't include it up here, but we're doing the old rules now. Normal second law in the vertical direction. So I use vertical forces, and if they're upward I'm gonna treat them as positive, and if they're downward like this five times 9.8, I'm gonna treat it as a negative, because it points down. Five times 9.8 meters per second squared, and I divide by the five kilogram mass, 'cause that's the box I'm analyzing. I'm not analyzing the whole system. I'm just analyzing the five kilogram box now. And I can solve and I can get my tension. The alternate way to do this would be to say, all right, let's just treat down as positive for this five kilogram mass. I'd then plug my acceleration in as positive, and I'd plug my force of gravity in positive, then my tension would be negative. I'd get the same value. Here I'm just solving for the magnitude of the tension anyway. So if I solve this, if I plug this into the calculator and solve for tension, I'm gonna get 36.75 Newtons, which is less than the force of gravity, which it has to be, 'cause if the tension was greater than the force of gravity, this five kilogram mass would accelerate up. We know that doesn't happen. The tension's gotta be less than the force of gravity, so that this five kilogram mass can accelerate downward. So that's a quick way to solve for the magnitude of the acceleration of the system by treating it as a single object. We're saying that if it's a single object, or thought of as a single object, which we can do, 'cause these are required to have the same acceleration, or same magnitude of the acceleration, that if we're treating it like a single object, only external forces matter, and those external forces that make the system go are going to accelerate the system. And those external forces that resist the motion are trying to reduce the acceleration, and we divide by the total mass of the system that we're treating as one object, we get the acceleration. If that still seems like mathematical witchcraft, or if you're not sure about this whole idea, I encourage you to go back and watch the video. We solved one of these types of problems the hard way. And you see, you really do end up with the force that tries to make the system go externally, and the external force that tries to stop it divided by the total mass gives you the acceleration. Essentially, what we're saying is that these internal forces cancel if you're thinking of this system as one single object, 'cause these are applied internally, and they're opposed to each other. One tries to make the system go, one tries to make the system stop.",science_physics_forces-newtons-laws
" -  What we're going to do in this video is start to compare distributions. So, for example here, we have two distributions that show the various temperatures different cities get during the month of January. This is the distribution for Portland. For example, they get eight days between one and four degrees Celsius. The get 12 days between four and seven degrees Celsius, and so forth, and so on, and then this is the distribution for Minneapolis. Now, when we make these comparisons, what we're going to focus on is the center of the distributions, to compare that, and also the spread. Sometimes people will talk about the variability of the distributions. And so, this is, these are the things that we're going to compare. And making the comparison, we're actually going to try to eyeball it. We're not going to try to pick a measure of central tendencies, say the mean or the median and then calculate precisely what those numbers are for these. We might wanna do those if they're close. But if we can eyeball it, that would be even better. Similar for the spread and variability. In either of these cases, there are multiple measures in our statistical toolkit center. Mean, median is valuable of the center. For spread/variability, the range, the interquartile range, the mean absolute deviation, the standard deviation. These are all measures. But sometimes, you can just kind of gauge it by looking. So, in this first comparison, which distribution has a higher center, or are they comparable? Well, if you look at the distribution for Portland, the center of this distribution, let's say if we were to just think about the mean, although I think the mean and the median would be reasonably close right over here. It seems like it would be around, it would be around seven or maybe a little bit lower than seven. So it would be kind of in... It would be kind of in that range. Maybe between five and seven would be our central tendency. It would be either our mean or our median, while for Minneapolis, it looks like our center is much closer to maybe negative two or negative three degrees Celsius. So here, even though we don't know precisely what the mean or the median is of each of these distributions, you can say that Portland, Portland distribution has a higher center. Has higher center. However, you wanna measure either mean or median. Now, what about the spread or variability? Well, if you just superficially thought about range, you see here that there's nothing below one degree Celsius and nothing above 13. So you have about a 13-degree range at most right over here. In fact, what might be contributing to this first column? It might be a bunch of things at three degrees or even 3.9 degrees, and similarly, what's contributing to this last column might be a bunch of things at 10.1 degrees. But at most, you have a 12-degree range right over here, while over here, it looks like you have, well, it looks like it's approaching a 27-degree range. So, based on that, and even if you just eyeball it, this is just, we're using the same scales for our horizontal axes here, the temperature axes, and this is just a much wider distribution than what you see over here. And so you would say that the Minneapolis distribution has more spread or a higher spread or more variability. So, higher spread right over here. Let's do another example. And we'll use a different representation for the data here. So we're told at the Olympic games, many events have several rounds of competition. One of these events is the men's 100-meter backstroke. The upper dot plot shows the times in seconds of the top eight finishers in the final round of the 2012 Olympics. So that's the green right over here, the final round. The lower dot plot shows the times of the same eight swimmers but in the semi-final round. So, given these distributions, which one has a higher center? Well, once again, and here, you can actually, it's a little bit easier to eyeball here what the median might be. The mean, I would probably have to do a little bit more mathematics. But let's say the median... Let's see. There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight data points. So the median is gonna sit between the lower four and the upper four. So the central tendency right over here is for the final round, is, looks like it's around 57.1 seconds, while if we, especially if we think about the median, while the central tendency for the semi-final round, let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Looks like it is right about there. So this is about 57, more than 57.3 seconds. So, the semi-final round seems to have a higher central tendency, which is a little bit counterintuitive. You would expect the finalists to be running faster on average than the semi-finalists, but that's not what this data is showing. So the semi-final round has higher center. Higher, higher center. And I just eyeballed the median. And I suspect that the mean would also be higher in this second distribution. And now what about variability? Well, once again, if you just looked at range, these are both at the same scale. If you just visually look, the variability here, the range for the final round is larger than the range for the semi-final round. So you would say that the final round has higher variability. Variability. It has a higher range. Eyeballing it, it looks like it has a higher, a higher spread, and there is of course times where one distribution could have a higher range but then it might have a lower standard deviation. For example, you could have data that's like, you know, two data points that are really far apart, but then all the other data just sits right, it's really, really closely packed. So, for example, a distribution like this... I'll draw the horizontal axis here, just so you can imagine it as a distribution. A distribution like this might have a higher range but lower standard deviation than a distribution like this. Let me just... I'm just drawing a very rough example. A distribution like this has a lower range but actually might have a higher standard deviation. Might have a higher standard deviation than the one above it. In fact, I can make that even better. A distribution like this would have a lower range but it would also have a higher standard deviation. So you can't just look at... It's not always the case that just by looking at one of these measures, the range of the standard deviation, you'll know for sure, but in cases like this, it's safe to say when you're looking at it by inspection that look, this green, the final round data does seem to have a higher range, higher variability, and so I feel pretty good. This is a very high-level comparison.",math_ap-statistics_quantitative-data-ap
" -  So we're told that F of two is equal to 12, F prime of X is equal to 24 over X to the third and what we want to figure out is what is F of negative one. Alright, so they give us the derivative in terms of X. So maybe we could take the anti-derivative of the derivative to find our original function. So let's do that. So we could say that F of X, F of X is going to be equal to the anti-derivative or we could say the indefinite integral of F prime of X, which is equal to 24 over X to the third. I could write it over like this, 24 over X to the third. But to help me process it a little bit more, I'm gonna write this as 24 X to the negative three 'cause then it'll become how to take that anti-derivative. D, DX. And so what is the anti-derivative of 24X to the negative three? Well we're just going to do the power rule in reverse. So what we're going to do is we're going to increase the exponent. So let me just rewrite it. It's going to be 24X to the, we're going to increase the exponent by one, so it's gonna be X to the negative three plus one and then we're going to divide by that increased exponent. So negative three plus one and so that is going to be negative three plus one is X to the negative two and then we divide by negative two and if you're in doubt about what we just did where we're kind of doing the power rule in reverse, now take the derivative of this using the power rule. Negative two times 24 over negative two is just gonna be 24 and then you decrement that exponent, you go to negative three. So are we done here, is this F of X? Well F of X might involve a constant. So let's put a constant out here because notice if you were to take the derivative of this thing here, the derivative of 24X to the negative two over negative two we already established is 24X to the negative three. But then if you take the derivative of a constant, well that just disappears. So you don't see it when you look at the derivative. So we have to make sure that there might be a constant and I have a feeling based on the information that they've given us, we're going to make use of that constant. So let me rewrite F of X. So we know that F of X can be expressed as 24 divided by negative two. It's negative 12X to the negative two plus some constant. So how do we figure out that constant? Well they have told us what F of two is. F of two is equal to 12. So let's write this down. So F of two is equal to 12, which is equal to well we just have to put two in everywhere we see an X. That's going to be negative two times two to the negative two power plus C and so 12 is equal to, what is this, two to the negative two. Two to the negative two is equal to one over two squared, which is equal to 1/4. So this is negative 12 times 1/4. Negative 12 times 1/4 is negative three. So it's negative three plus C. Now we can add three to both sides to solve or C. We get 15 is equal to C. So or C is equal to 15. That is equal to 15. And so now we can write our F of X as we get F of X is equal to negative 12 and I could even write that as negative 12 over X squared if we like. Negative 12 over X squared plus 15 and now using that we can evaluate F of negative one. F of negative one. Everywhere we see an X we put a negative one there. So this is going to be negative one squared. So F of negative one is equal to 12 divided by, negative 12 divided by negative one squared. Well negative one squared is just one. So it's gonna be negative 12 plus 15, which is equal to three and we're done. This thing is equal to three.",math_old-integral-calculus_indefinite-integrals
" -  In this video, I wanna do some examples looking at distributions, in particular, different features in distributions like clusters, gaps, and peaks. So over here, I wanna do some examples. Which of the following are accurate descriptions of the distribution below? Select all that apply. So the first statement is the distribution has an outlier. So an outlier is a data point that's way off of where the other data points are, it's way larger or way smaller than where all of the other data points seem to be clustered and if we look over here, we have a lot of data points between zero and six. And let's just think about what they're measuring: this is shelf time for each apple at Gorg's Grocier. So, for example, we see there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven apples that have a shelf life of zero days, so (laughs), they're about to go bad. You see you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight apples that are gonna be good for another day. You have two apples that are gonna be good for another six days, and you have one apple that's gonna be good for 10 days, and this is unusual. This is an outlier here, it has a way larger shelf life than all of the other data, so I would say this definitely does have an outlier. We just have this one data point sitting all the way to the right, way larger, way more shelf life than everything else, so it definitely has an outlier, and this one would be the outlier. The distribution has a cluster from four to six days. And we indeed do see a cluster from four to six days. A cluster, you can imagine, it's a grouping of data that's sitting there, or you have a grouping of apples that have a shelf life between four and six days, and you definitely do see that cluster there. And since I already selected two things, I'm definitely not gonna select none of the above. Let me check my answer. Let me do a few more of these. Which of the following are accurate descriptions of the distribution below? And once again we're going to select all that apply. So the distribution has an outlier. So let's see this distribution. I do have a data point here that is at the high end and I have another data point here that's at the low end, but I don't have any data points that are sitting far above or far below the bulk of the data. If I had a data point that was out here, then yeah, I would say that was an outlier to the right, or a positive outlier, if I had a data point way to the left off the screen over here, maybe that would be an outlier, but I don't really see any obvious outliers. All of the data, it's pretty clustered together. So I would not say that the distribution has an outlier. The distribution has a peak at 22 degrees. Yeah, it does indeed look like we have, and let's just look at what we're actually measuring: high temperature each day in Edgeton, Iowa in July. So it does indeed look like we have the most number of days that had a high temperature at 22, most number of days in July had a high tempurature at 22 degrees Celsius, so that is a peak. You can see it, if you imagine this as kind of a mountain this is a peak right here, this is a high point. You have, at least locally, the most number of days at 22 degrees Celsius. So I would say it definitely has a peak there. Since I selected something, I'm not gonna select none of the above. Let's do a couple more of these. Which of the following are accurate descrptions of the distribution below? So the first one, the distribution has an outlier. So... number of guests by day at Seth's Sandwich Shop. So, let's see, the lowest... They have no days... No days where he had between zero and 19 guests, no days where he had between 20 and 39 guests, looks like there's about nine days where he had between 40 and 59 guests, looks like 20 days where he had between 60 and 79 guests, all the way where it looks like maybe 8 days that he had between 180 and 199 guests. But the question of outliers, there doesn't seem to be any day where he had an unusual number of guests. There's not a day that's way out here, where he had, like, 500 guests. So I would say this distribution does not have an outlier. The distribution has a cluster from zero to 39 guests. So zero to 39 guests is right over here, zero to 39 guests. And there is no days where he had between zero and 39 guests neither zero to 19, or 20 to 39. So there's definitely not a cluster there. I would say that the cluster would be between days that had between 40 and 199 guests. Definitely not zero and 39, there was no days that were between zero and 39 guests. So I would say none of the above very confidently. Let's do one more of these. Which of the following are accurate descriptions of the distribution below? (laughs) Alright. The distribution has a peak from 12 to 13 points. Let me see what this is measuring, what this data is about. Test scores by student in Mrs. Frine's class. So you had one student who got between a zero and a one on a 20-point scale, so got between, I guess out of 20 questions, got between zero and one point. And then you see that there's no students got between two and three, or four and five, or six and seven. Then we have another student who got between eight and nine, looks like three students got between 10 and 11, and then we keep increasing, this looks like about 12 students got either a 16 or a 17, or something in between maybe, if you could get decimal points on that test. And then it looks like 10 students got from 18 to 19. Alright, so this says the distribution has a peak from 12 to 13 points, 12 to 13 points, there were five students, but this isn't a peak. If you just go to 14 to 15 points, you have more students. So this is definitely not a peak. If you were looking at this as a mountain of some kind, you definitely wouldn't describe this point as a peak. You would say this distribution has a peak, it has the most number of students who got between 16 and 17 points, so that's the peak right there, not 12 to 13 points. So I would not select that first choice. The distribution has an outlier. Well, yeah, look at this: you have this outlier. Most of the students scored between eight and 19 points, and then you have this one student who got between zero and one, it's really an outlier. You even see this when you look at it visually, it's not even connected to the rest of the distribution. It's way to the left. If something is way to the left or way to the right, that's an outlier if it's unusually low or unusually high. So I would say this distribution definitely does have an outlier, and I'm not gonna pick none of the above since I found a choice. And I think we're all done.",math_7th-grade-foundations-engageny_7th-m5-engage-ny-foundations
" We're told that ""Each square below represents one whole."" So this big square right over here is a whole, and then this big square over here is another whole. Then they ask us ""Which of the following does the shaded area represent? Select all that apply."" So let's see-- the shaded area. We're shaded in blue. So let's see-- one way to think about it is we have 1 whole over here. and then over here we've divided it into tenths: there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 equal sections, and we've shaded in one of them. So we've shaded 1 tenth. So this would be 1 whole and 1 tenth. So we could say that this is 1 and 1 tenth. So that's one way to think about it, but what about these other ones? Well even this one has been divided into tenths, and you can view 1 whole as 10 tenths. You see that here, where we've divided it into 10 equal sections. 10 tenths, and we've shaded all 10 tenths in. So this whole you could view as 10 tenths: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. And then we have an 11th tenth. So we have-- if you count these blue rectangles, we have 11 tenths. So you could also write this as 11 tenths. Now 11 hundredths? No, I don't think-- we haven't even divided this into hundredths, and 11 hundredths would be a little more than 1 tenth. And so this is definitely way more than that. So I could check my answer (and actually you don't see it but it's happening off-screen) but this is what I would go with for that. Let's do a couple more of these. So it says ""Which of the following describes the location of the point on the number line?"" Let's see. I have 1, and then between 1 and 2 I've divided it into 10 equal spaces. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. So each of these tick marks, or hash marks, is going to be a tenth. So this is 1 and 0 tenths, 1 and 1 tenth, 1 and 2 tenths, 1 and 3 tenths, 1 and 4 tenths, 1 and 5 tenths, 1 and 6 tenths, 1 and 7 tenths, 1 and 8 tenths. So 1 and 8 tenths is the same thing as 1.8. 1 and 8 tenths. So it's that. But what about these other options? Well one way we could think about this is-- let's just count the tenths. Each of these hash marks is a tenth. So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. It makes sense. A whole is 10 tenths. Let's keep going, we were at 10 tenths. 11 tenths, 12 tenths, 13 tenths, 14 tenths, 15 tenths, 16 tenths, 17 tenths, 18 tenths. This one also applies. 18 hundredths: this would be between 10 hundredths and 20 hundredths which would be the same thing as between 1 tenth and 2 tenths. So 18 hundredths is going to be someplace around here, so I definitely will not select that one. Let's try a few more of these. So they say ""Write a decimal that is equal to 24 tenths."" Alright, 24 tenths. So remember we could view this as-- I'll just write it down-- we could view this as 20 tenths plus 4 tenths. But what is 20 tenths equal to? 10 tenths is equal to a whole, so 20 tenths is going to be equal to 2 wholes. So this could be viewed as 2 plus 4 tenths, or another way to write this-- we could just write 4 in the tenths place. So we could just write this as 2.4. 24 tenths: 20 tenths are 2 wholes and then you have another 4 tenths. Let's do one other one. ""102 hundredths."" So we could rewrite this as 100 hundredths plus 2 hundredths. Now, what is 100 hundredths? Well 100 hundredths is equal to 1, is equal to a whole. So 100 hundredths is just equal to 1. So you could view this as 1 plus 2 hundredths. Another way to write two hundredths is 0.02. So what's 1 plus 0.02? Well it's just going to be 1.02. And you see that here. You have 1 and 2 hundredths. 1 is the same thing as 100 hundredths. So this is 100 hundredths and you have 2 hundredths gives you 102 hundredths. Alright, let's do another one. ""What is 32 tenths written as a decimal?"" So we just have to remind ourselves: 10 tenths is equal to a whole. 20 tenths is equal to 2 ones. 30 tenths is equal to 3 ones. So this is going to be equal to 3 ones and then another 2 tenths. 3 ones and another 2 tenths. Let's keep going. ""What is 203 hundredths written as a decimal?"" Well we have to remind ourselves that 200 hundredths is equal to 2 ones. So here this is the same thing as 2 ones and 3 hundredths. 2 ones-- this case right here-- 2 ones and 3 hundredths. Let's do a couple more of these. ""1.05 is equal to how many hundredths?"" Well, one whole, or 1, is equal to 100 hundredths. So this is 100 hundredths plus 5 hundredths, or 105 hundredths. Alright. Let's do another one. ""How can 2.60 be written in words?"" So I could write this as 2 and 6 tenths. 2 ones and 6 tenths. I could also think of this as 2 ones and 60 hundredths. Or I could view this as 260 hundredths. So let's see which of these choices-- So ""2 ones and 6 hundredths""... No, no, it's 2 ones and 60 hundredths, not 6 hundredths. It's 6 tenths right over here. 6 tenths or 60 hundredths. I won't select that. ""260 hundredths."" Yeah, that's right because 2 ones is that same thing as 200 hundredths and then we have another 60 hundredths right over there. So that's right. ""260 tenths."" No, 260 tenths-- remember 10 tenths is equal to a whole, so 260 tenths would be 26, would be 26 ones. So it's not that choice either. So anyway, I think we've done plenty of examples. Hopefully you have enjoyed that.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_imp-decimals
" -  Consider the polynomials, P of X is equal to X to the sixth minus X to the fifth minus X to the third minus X squared minus X. And Q of X is equal to X to the fourth minus X to the third minus X squared minus one. Given that Z one, Z two, Z three, and Z four are the roots of Q of X equals zero, find P of Z one plus P of Z two, plus P of Z three, plus P of Z four. So a good place to start, and you might have already realized this, that if these guys are the roots of Q of X equals zero, that means that Q of Z one is equal to Q of Z two, which is equal to Q of Z three, which is equal to Q of Z four, which is equal to zero. They're the roots, they are solutions to this equation here. Now given that, and we want to evaluate P of Z one plus P of Z two, it seems like it would be useful if we can express P of X in terms of Q of X, because then when we evaluate these, the parts that would be Q of Z one or Z two or whatever would evaluate to zero. So let's try to do that over there. So the first thing I'm gonna try to do, I'm gonna try to express these higher degree terms in terms of Q of X. And to do that, if I multiple Q of X times X squared, this X to the fourth will become an X to the sixth, this X to the third will become an X to the fifth. It won't be exact, but we might be able to adjust a little bit to get something right over here. So let's try to do that. So let's think a little bit about what, let's think about what X squared, X squared times Q of X is going to look like. That's going to be X squared times X to the fourth. That's X to the sixth, minus X to the fifth, minus X to the fourth, minus X squared. Just multiplied all of these terms times X squared. Now that isn't exactly what we have up here for P of X. In order to get it exact, in order to get it exact, we need to, what are we going to have to do? Let's see, we don't have an X to the fourth up here, so we're gonna have to get rid of this X to the fourth. So let's add X to the fourth to both sides. So let's add X to the fourth to both sides of this equation. So that would get rid of an X to the fourth. And let's see, we have no X to the third here, we do have an X to the third there, so let's subtract X to the third from both sides of this equation. So I'm gonna subtract X to the third from both sides of this equation. And then we do have a negative X squared, we do have a negative X squared over here. And then we have a negative X here. I don't see a negative X over here, so let's subtract a negative X from both sides. So negative X. This is all for the left-hand side. And so we're left with the left-hand side of the equation we get X squared times Q of X, X squared times Q of X plus X to the fourth, plus X to the fourth minus X to the third, minus X is equal to, what's this equal to? It's equal to X to the sixth. I didn't want to use that shade of purple, let me use the blue one. It's equal to X to the sixth minus X to the fifth, these guys cancel out, minus X to the third, minus X to third minus X squared, minus X squared, and then you have a minus X there. Minus X. Which is exactly, this is, we were actually able to completely construct P of X. This is equal to P of X. It's equal to all of this business on the left-hand side. Now we could just stop there, but it looks, this part right here, this part right here looks tantalizingly close to Q of X as well. In fact it is, that part right there, using the exact same process would be Q of X, just the green part, it's Q of X with these things gotten rid of. So we would have to add an X squared. So it's Q of X plus X squared, plus X squared plus one. Right? If you start with Q of X, you add an X squared, you add a one, these two will go away, you just have an X to the fourth minus X to the third. So now we can rewrite P of X. We can rewrite P of X, I'll do it right over here, P of X is equal to X squared times Q of X, it's equal to, no, that's not the same blue. It's equal to X squared times Q of X plus this business, plus Q of X, plus X squared plus one. And then we have this last negative X, or last minus X right over there. Now, when we evaluate, if I say, if I say that R is a root. So if R is a root of Q. Or if I write Q of R is equal to zero, then what is P of R? P of R is going to be equal to X squared times Q of R plus Q of R, plus R squared, I'll switch these, minus R, plus one. So this is going to be zero, obviously. Q of R is zero, so this whole term is zero. This whole term is zero. So P of R is going to be equal to R squared minus R, plus one. Now, obviously all of these guys are roots so we can use that same logic. We can use that same logic. We can say P of, let me do a new color here. A new color is warranted. P of Z one is equal to Z one squared, minus Z one plus one. P of Z two, P of Z two is equal to Z two squared, minus Z two plus one. I could, I'll go all four. P of Z three. P of Z three is equal to Z three squared, minus Z three plus one. And then finally we have P of Z four. P of Z four, in that slightly different shade of orange, is Z sub four squared minus Z sub four plus one. Now remember our problem. We just want to find the sum of these things. We just want to take the sum. So this sum is going to be the sum of these expressions and you might be saying, Sal, we still don't know what these sums are. I could sum all the ones, I'll get a four there, but now I have to sum all the roots of Q of X and I have to sum all the squares of the roots of Q of X? And this is not a simple thing and frankly it's not taught in most algebra classes or precalculus classes. This is a problem to really separate the people who study kind of quirky properties of polynomials from the people who don't study quirky properties of polynomials, but the last two videos I just recorded in the competition math playlist, and I actually added them to the algebra playlist as well, tell you how to find the sum of the roots of a polynomial or the sum of the squares of the roots of a polynomial. So let's think about this a little bit. So let's add up all the ones, that's easy, we get four. Now, we're also gonna have to add up all of, when you add up all of these guys over here. Let me do this in a new color. When I add up all of these guys over here, it's going to be negative Z one plus Z two plus Z three plus Z four. Now, two videos ago, I think it was, we show that the sum of the roots of a polynomial, and this the sum of the roots of Q of X, that that is equal to the negative of the coefficient on the second to highest degree term. Or, I should say that on the degree term that's one less than the highest degree term. So if we go to Q of X, we go to Q of X, it's a fourth degree polynomial. The sum of the roots, to find the sum of the roots we go one degree less than that, so we look for the third degree term, that's this over here. The coefficient on the third degree term over here is negative one. It has a negative one coefficient, so the sum of the roots, the sum of the roots, this over here is going to be equal the negative of that coefficient. So negative negative one, so it's the negative of negative one, which is just plus one. And of course we have a negative out front here, so this whole thing is going to evaluate to negative one. So that whole business evaluates to negative one. Now, we have to take the sum of the squares, We have to do all of this over here. We have to do all of this over here. The sum of Z one squared plus Z two squared plus Z three squared plus Z four squared. Now in the last video where I talk about the sum of the squares, I didn't prove it for the fourth degree case. It's actually pretty easy to extend it from the third degree case that we did in that video to the fourth degree and it's little messy to do it generally do the whole induction thing that I did with the straight up sum, not the sum of the squares. But hopefully you see, or at least you understood how to apply it and if you're interested, you actually could extend it to the fourth power or to the nth power, but this is going to be equal to the coefficient on, I should look at Q of X. The coefficient on the degree one less than the highest degree, so it's going to be, so this is a negative one. So it's going to be equal to negative one squared, negative one squared minus two times the coefficient on the degree below that. So minus two times the coefficient over here. So over here, so we're looking, we started at this degree, now we're going even one lower than that. Two lower than the degree of the polynomial. So we go to the X squared term. This coefficient is negative one. So minus two times negative one. This is equal to one, one plus two, which is equal to three. So this thing over here in green when you take the sum of the squares, it's equal to three. And so when you take the total sum of P evaluated at each of those possibly complex numbers, we get three minus two plus four is equal to six. And we're done.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_aime
" -  Let's now explain to ourselves, I guess you could say, a more formal communication of the Integral Test. Integral Test. So it tells us that if we assume that we have sum f of x, if we have sum f of x that is positive... positive, continuous... continuous... continuous, and decreasing... and decreasing... and decreasing on some interval, on... So starting at k, and including k, all the way to infinity. Then we can make one of two statements. We could say either that if the improper integral from k to infinity of f of x dx is convergent, is convergent, then... then the sum, the infinite series from n is equal to k to infinity of f of n, is also convergent. Is also convergent... Convergent. And this is actually the case that we saw when we looked at one over n squared, but I'll look at that in a second. But the second claim that we could make, or the second deduction that we might be able to make using the Integral Test, is if that's the other way around. That if the integral from k to infinity, the improper integral of f of x dx, is divergent, divergent, then the same thing is true for the corresponding infinite series. Then this infinite series right over here is also going to be... is also divergent. And as I already mentioned, in the last video we already saw this in the case of f of x is equal to one over x squared. We saw that since the integral from one to infinity of one over x squared, over one over x squared dx, is convergent, in fact, it equals one. It equals one. Because of that, we were able to say that the sum from n equals the sum from n is equal to one to infinity of one over n squared, is also convergent. Also convergent. And now we can see an example where we go the other way. For example, we know that this integral... Let me write the integral down. Let's start with this integral. From one to infinity, not of f of x is equal to one over x squared, but let's say that f of x is equal to one over x. Actually let me just write that down. Let's just start with f of x is equal to one over x. It definitely meets our conditions that it is positive, and let's say we were going to consider it over the interval... over the interval from one to infinity. So it meets this first constraint. Over this interval, one over x is positive, it is continuous, and it is decreasing. As x increases, f of x decreases. So the Integral Test should apply. So let's see what the improper integral from one to infinity of this would be. So if we take... If we go from one to infinity of one over x, of one over x dx, this is equal to... We could write this as the limit as t approaches infinity of the definite integral from one to t, of one over x dx, which is equal to the limit, as t approaches infinity, of, take the antiderivative, is going to be of the natural log of x, the natural log of x going from one to t. One to t, we could do the... Well, it's really the absolute value of x, but we're dealing with positive x's here so it's just going to be the natural log of x, which is going to be the limit as t approaches infinity of the natural log of t, or I could even say the natural log of the absolute value of t, which is going to be the natural log of t, because it's positive t's, minus the natural log of one. Minus the natural log of the absolute value of one. The natural log of one is zero, so it's going to be the natural log of t. The limit of that approaches infinity. But the limit as that approaches infinity is just going to be unbounded, this is going to go to infinity. This right over here is divergent. So this right over here is divergent. So this is divergent. And because this is divergent, we can then say, we can then say, by the Integral Test, we can then say the Integral Test... Once again, our function over this interval, positive, continuous, decreasing. We saw that this improper integral right over here is divergent, and then by the second point of the Integral Test we can say therefore, and I haven't rigorously proved it yet, but hopefully I gave you a good intuitive justification in the previous video, that the integral... that the infinite series from n equals one to infinity of one over n, which is the harmonic series, that this is also, this is also... this is also divergent. So we've already shown that the harmonic series is divergent using that very beautiful, elegant proof by Oresme, I think I'm probably mispronouncing his name, though used the comparison test, but just like this we have used the Integral Test to show that it is also divergent. And once again, let's remember what the whole motivation of the Integral Test is. Let me draw f of x is equal to one over x. So f of x is equal to one over x would look like... Do my best attempt here. So let's say that's one, two, three, and that is one, two... And so let's see, when x is one f of x is one, when x is two f of x is 1/2 or 1/3. If it's 1/2 here, it will be two over here. So it looks like this. So this is f of x is equal to one over n, and once again we see that then over the interval we care about, from one to infinity, it's definitely positive, continuous, and decreasing. And if we look at this sum right over here, we could view this sum as... Let's do that, let me write it down. So the sum... The sum from n equals one to infinity of one over n, is equal to one plus 1/2 plus 1/3, and of course we keep going on and on and on and on. In this case, since we want to show it's divergent, we could say, ""Hey, look, this is an overestimate of, ""of this area here."" Let me be clear. So we have this area. We have this area in green, which is what the improper integral is denoting. So that right over there is the improper integral from one to infinity of one over x dx. Now you could view this as an overestimate of that area. So this first... This one right over here, you could say that this is this one height times one width, so that's that block right over there, that's the area of that... is going to be equal to one. Then this over here, 1/2, you could view that as the area of the next block, of the next block. So you could kind of view this as a left-sided Riemann sum, I guess is one way to think about it. And so this is going to be 1/2... Yeah, left-sided Riemann sum. So this is going to be 1/2, and then the 1/3 is going to be this one, it's going to be this one. I noticed they're all... The actual area we care about, the improper integral, it's all contained in these blocks. So this is going to be an over... is going to be larger than this, but we've already seen that this is unbounded towards infinity. This is divergent. So if this is larger than this, and this is divergent, this goes to infinity, then this must also go to infinity. So that's exactly where the Integral Test is coming from.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-series-new
" - We're asked, ""Which of the following vectors have ""the same x component as vector a?"" And they tell us to ""Select all that apply"" This is vector a right over here and we only have to concern ourselves with the x component. That's what they're asking us about. Let's think about what it's x component is. We're starting at this point right over here, which has an x value of negative two and we're going from x equals negative two to x is equal to negative five. Our change in x, another way to think about it, our x component. We're going from negative two to negative five. Our x value goes down by three. Our change in x is equal to negative three. That would also be the x component of vector a. We could say that vector a is equal to, it's x component is negative three. We're not concerning ourselves with our y component but we see that our y goes up by one. So it's negative three comma one but we just care about our x component. Let's think about what other vectors here have an x component of negative three. That, if we start at our initial point and go to the terminal point, our x value has gone down by three. We're gonna start with vector b here. And let's see, if we start there our x value is three at our initial point, our starting point for that vector. Then, to go to the x value of the terminal point we once again went down by three. This has the same x component. Vector b is going to be negative three comma something. I will select that one. Let's think about vector c. Vector c starts here at x equals negative 4 and then it ends at x equals negative one. It's x component is going to look, one way to think about it, our change in x is going to look like this. You might be tempted to say this is the same thing. It has a length of three but notice, we're not going three to the left, the way that we did in vector a or in vector b. We're going three to the right. Here our change in x is positive three and so vector c is going to be positive three comma something. It's not gonna be vector c. Now let's look at vector d. Vector d starts over here, it's x value is negative six and we're going from x equals negative six to x equals negative nine. Once again we have gone down. Our change in x is negative three. That has the same x component. If I were to say vector d I would say it's negative three comma something. I haven't figured out what these are but I don't need to for this problem. So vector d also has the same x component, an x component of negative three and we're done.",math_precalculus_vectors
" Now let's do a really interesting problem. So I have y equals x, and y is equal to x squared minus 2x right over here. And we're going to rotate the region in between these two functions. So that's this region right over here. And we're not going to rotate it just around the x-axis, we're going to rotate it around the horizontal line y equals 4. So we're going to rotate it around this. And if we do that, we'll get a shape that looks like this. I drew it ahead of time, just so I could draw it nicely. And as you can see, it looks like some type of a vase with a hole at the bottom. And so what we're going to do is attempt to do this using, I guess you'd call it the washer method which is a variant of the disk method. So let's construct a washer. So let's look at a given x. So let's say an x right over here. So let's say that we're at an x right over there. And what we're going to do is we're going to rotate this region. We're going to give it some depth, dx. So that is dx. We're going to rotate this around the line y is equal to 4. So if you were to visualize it over here, you have some depth. And when you rotate it around, the inner radius is going to look like the inner radius of our washer. It's going to look something like that. And then the outer radius of our washer is going to contour around x squared minus 2x. So it's going to look something-- my best attempt to draw it-- it's going to look something like that. And of course, our washer is going to have some depth. So let me draw the depth. So it's going to have some depth, dx. So this is my best attempt at drawing some of that the depth. So this is the depth of our washer. And then just to make the face of the washer a little bit clearer, let me do it in this green color. So the face of the washer is going to be all of this business. All of this business is going to be the face of our washer. So if we can figure out the volume of one of these washers for a given x, then we just have to sum up all of the washers for all of the x's in our interval. So let's see if we can set up the integral, and maybe in the next video we'll just forge ahead and actually evaluate the integral. So let's think about the volume of the washer. To think about the volume of the washer, we really just have to think about the area of the face of the washer. So area of ""face""-- put face in quotes-- is going to be equal to what? Well, it would be the area of the washer-- if it wasn't a washer, if it was just a coin-- and then subtract out the area of the part that you're cutting out. So the area of the washer if it didn't have a hole in the middle would just be pi times the outer radius squared. It would be pi times this radius squared, that we could call the outer radius. And since it's a washer, we need to subtract out the area of this inner circle. So minus pi times inner radius squared. So we really just have to figure out what the outer and inner radius, or radii I should say, are. So let's think about it. So our outer radius is going to be equal to what? Well, we can visualize it over here. This is our outer radius, which is also going to be equal to that right over there. So that's the distance between y equals 4 and the function that's defining our outside. So this is essentially, this height right over here, is going to be equal to 4 minus x squared minus 2x. I'm just finding the distance or the height between these two functions. So the outer radius is going to be 4 minus this, minus x squared minus 2x, which is just 4 minus x squared plus 2x. Now, what is the inner radius? What is that going to be? Well, that's just going to be this distance between y equals 4 and y equals x. So it's just going to be 4 minus x. So if we wanted to find the area of the face of one of these washers for a given x, it's going to be-- and we can factor out this pi-- it's going to be pi times the outer radius squared, which is all of this business squared. So it's going to be 4 minus x squared plus 2x squared minus pi times the inner radius-- although we factored out the pi-- so minus the inner radius squared. So minus 4 minus x squared. So this will give us the area of the surface or the face of one of these washers. If we want the volume of one of those watchers, we then just have to multiply times the depth, dx. And then if we want to actually find the volume of this entire figure, then we just have to sum up all of these washers for each of our x's. So let's do that. So we're going to sum up the washers for each of our x's and take the limit as they approach zero, but we have to make sure we got our interval right. So what are these-- we care about the entire region between the points where they intersect. So let's make sure we get our interval. So to figure out our interval, we just say when does y equal x intersect y equal x squared minus 2x? Let me do this in a different color. We just have to think about when does x equal x squared minus 2x. When are our two functions equal to each other? Which is equivalent to-- if we just subtract x from both sides, we get when does x squared minus 3x equal 0. We can factor out an x on the right hand side. So this is going to be when does x times x minus 3 equal zero. Well, if the product is equal to 0, at least one of these need to be equal to 0. So x could be equal to 0, or x minus 3 is equal to 0. So x is equal to 0 or x is equal to 3. So this is x is 0, and this right over here is x is equal to 3. So that gives us our interval. We're going to go from x equals 0 to x equals 3 to get our volume. In the next video, we'll actually evaluate this integral.",math_ap-calculus-ab_ab-applications-of-integration-new
" A line passes through the points negative 3, 6 and 6, 0. Find the equation of this line in point slope form, slope intercept form, standard form. And the way to think about these, these are just three different ways of writing the same equation. So if you give me one of them, we can manipulate it to get any of the other ones. But just so you know what these are, point slope form, let's say the point x1, y1 are, let's say that that is a point on the line. And when someone puts this little subscript here, so if they just write an x, that means we're talking about a variable that can take on any value. If someone writes x with a subscript 1 and a y with a subscript 1, that's like saying a particular value x and a particular value of y, or a particular coordinate. And you'll see that when we do the example. But point slope form says that, look, if I know a particular point, and if I know the slope of the line, then putting that line in point slope form would be y minus y1 is equal to m times x minus x1. So, for example, and we'll do that in this video, if the point negative 3 comma 6 is on the line, then we'd say y minus 6 is equal to m times x minus negative 3, so it'll end up becoming x plus 3. So this is a particular x, and a particular y. It could be a negative 3 and 6. So that's point slope form. Slope intercept form is y is equal to mx plus b, where once again m is the slope, b is the y-intercept-- where does the line intersect the y-axis-- what value does y take on when x is 0? And then standard form is the form ax plus by is equal to c, where these are just two numbers, essentially. They really don't have any interpretation directly on the graph. So let's do this, let's figure out all of these forms. So the first thing we want to do is figure out the slope. Once we figure out the slope, then point slope form is actually very, very, very straightforward to calculate. So, just to remind ourselves, slope, which is equal to m, which is going to be equal to the change in y over the change in x. Now what is the change in y? If we view this as our end point, if we imagine that we are going from here to that point, what is the change in y? Well, we have our end point, which is 0, y ends up at the 0, and y was at 6. So, our finishing y point is 0, our starting y point is 6. What was our finishing x point, or x-coordinate? Our finishing x-coordinate was 6. Let me make this very clear, I don't want to confuse you. So this 0, we have that 0, that is that 0 right there. And then we have this 6, which was our starting y point, that is that 6 right there. And then we want our finishing x value-- that is that 6 right there, or that 6 right there-- and we want to subtract from that our starting x value. Well, our starting x value is that right over there, that's that negative 3. And just to make sure we know what we're doing, this negative 3 is that negative 3, right there. I'm just saying, if we go from that point to that point, our y went down by 6, right? We went from 6 to 0. Our y went down by 6. So we get 0 minus 6 is negative 6. That makes sense. Y went down by 6. And, if we went from that point to that point, what happened to x? We went from negative 3 to 6, it should go up by 9. And if you calculate this, take your 6 minus negative 3, that's the same thing as 6 plus 3, that is 9. And what is negative 6/9? Well, if you simplify it, it is negative 2/3. You divide the numerator and the denominator by 3. So that is our slope, negative 2/3. So we're pretty much ready to use point slope form. We have a point, we could pick one of these points, I'll just go with the negative 3, 6. And we have our slope. So let's put it in point slope form. All we have to do is we say y minus-- now we could have taken either of these points, I'll take this one-- so y minus the y value over here, so y minus 6 is equal to our slope, which is negative 2/3 times x minus our x-coordinate. Well, our x-coordinate, so x minus our x-coordinate is negative 3, x minus negative 3, and we're done. We can simplify it a little bit. This becomes y minus 6 is equal to negative 2/3 times x. x minus negative 3 is the same thing as x plus 3. This is our point slope form. Now, we can literally just algebraically manipulate this guy right here to put it into our slope intercept form. Let's do that. So let's do slope intercept in orange. So we have slope intercept. So what can we do here to simplify this? Well, we can multiply out the negative 2/3, so you get y minus 6 is equal to-- I'm just distributing the negative 2/3-- so negative 2/3 times x is negative 2/3 x. And then negative 2/3 times 3 is negative 2. And now to get it in slope intercept form, we just have to add the 6 to both sides so we get rid of it on the left-hand side, so let's add 6 to both sides of this equation. Left-hand side of the equation, we're just left with a y, these guys cancel out. You get a y is equal to negative 2/3 x. Negative 2 plus 6 is plus 4. So there you have it, that is our slope intercept form, mx plus b, that's our y-intercept. Now the last thing we need to do is get it into the standard form. So once again, we just have to algebraically manipulate it so that the x's and the y's are both on this side of the equation. So let's just add 2/3 x to both sides of this equation. So I'll start it here. So we have y is equal to negative 2/3 x plus 4, that's slope intercept form. Let's added 2/3 x, so plus 2/3 x to both sides of this equation. I'm doing that so it I don't have this 2/3 x on the right-hand side, this negative 2/3 x. So the left-hand side of the equation-- I scrunched it up a little bit, maybe more than I should have-- the left-hand side of this equation is what? It is 2/3 x, because 2 over 3x, plus this y, that's my left-hand side, is equal to-- these guys cancel out-- is equal to 4. So this, by itself, we are in standard form, this is the standard form of the equation. If we want it to look, make it look extra clean and have no fractions here, we could multiply both sides of this equation by 3. If we do that, what do we get? 2/3 x times 3 is just 2x. y times 3 is 3y. And then 4 times 3 is 12. These are the same equations, I just multiplied every term by 3. If you do it to the left-hand side, you can do to the right-hand side-- or you have to do to the right-hand side-- and we are in standard form.",math_algebra-home_alg-linear-eq-func
" -  Let's now expose ourselves to another test of convergence, and that's the Alternating Series Test. I'll explain the Alternating Series Test and I'll apply it to an actual series while I do it to make the... Explanation of the Alternating Series Test a little bit more concrete. Let's say that I have some series, some infinite series. Let's say it goes from N equals K to infinity of A sub N. Let's say I can write it as or I can rewrite A sub N. So let's say A sub N, I can write. So A sub N is equal to negative one to the N, times B sub N or A sub N is equal to negative one to the N plus one times B sub N where B sub N is greater than or equal to zero for all the Ns we care about. So for all of these integer Ns greater than or equal to K. If all of these things, if all of these things are true and we know two more things, and we know number one, the limit as N approaches infinity of B sub N is equal to zero. Number two, B sub N is a decreasing sequence. Decreasing... Decreasing sequence. Then that lets us know that the original infinite series, the original infinite series, is going to converge. So this might seem a little bit abstract right now. Let's actually show, let's use this with an actual series to make it a little bit more, a little bit more concrete. Let's say that I had the series, let's say I had the series from N equals one to infinity of negative one to the N over N. We could write it out just to make this series a little bit more concrete. When N is equal to one, this is gonna be negative one to the one power. Actually, let's just make this a little bit, let's make this a little bit more interesting. Let's make this negative one to the N plus one. When N is equal to one, this is gonna be negative one squared over one which is gonna be one. Then when N is two, it's gonna be negative one to the third power which is gonna be negative one half. So it's minus one half plus one third minus one fourth plus minus and it keeps going on and on and on forever. Now, can we rewrite this A sub N like this. Well sure. The negative one to the N plus one is actually explicitly called out. We can rewrite our A sub N, so let me do that. So negative, so A sub N which is equal to negative one to the N plus one over N. This is clearly the same thing as negative one to the N plus one times one over N which is, which we can then say this thing right over here could be our B sub N. This right over here is our B sub N. We can verify that our B sub N is going to be greater than or equal to zero for all the Ns we care about. So our B sub N is equal to one over N. Clearly this is gonna be greater than or equal to zero for any, for any positive N. Now what's the limit? As B sub N, What's the limit of B sub N as N approaches infinity? The limit of, let me just write one over N, one over N, as N approaches infinity is going to be equal to zero. So we satisfied the first constraint. Then this is clearly a decreasing sequence as N increases the denominators are going to increase. With a larger denominator, you're going to have a lower value. We can also say one over N is a decreasing, decreasing sequence for the Ns that we care about. So this satifies, this is satisfied as well. Based on that, this thing is always, this thing right over here is always greater than or equal to zero. The limit, as one over N or as our B sub N, as N approaches infinity, is going to be zero. It's a decreasing sequence. Therefore we can say that our originial series actually converges. So N equals 1 to infinity of negative one to the N plus over N. And that's kind of interesting. Because we've already seen that if all of these were positive, if all of these terms were positive, we just have the Harmonic Series, and that one didn't converge. But this one did, putting these negatives here do the trick. Actually we can prove this one over here converges using other techniques. Maybe if we have time, actually in particular the limit comparison test. I'll just throw that out there in case you are curious. So this is a pretty powerful tool. It looks a little bit about like that Divergence Test, but remember the Divergence Test is really, is only useful if you want to show something diverges. If the limit of, if the limit of your terms do not approach zero, then you say okay, that thing is going to diverge. This thing is useful because you can actually prove convergence. Once again, if something does not pass the alternating series test, that does not necessarily mean that it diverges. It just means that you couldn't use the Alternating Series Test to prove that it converges.",math_old-integral-calculus_convergence-tests-integral-calc
" I want to build on what we did in the last video a little bit. Let's say we have two random variables. So I have random variable x. And let me draw its probability distribution. And actually, it doesn't have to be normal. But I'll just draw it as a normal distribution. So this is the distribution of random variable x. This is the mean. The population mean of random variable x. And then it has some type of standard deviation. Actually, let me just focus on the variance. So it has some variance right here for random variable x. This is x, the distribution for x. Let's say we have another random variable. Random variable y. Let's do the same thing for it. Let's draw its distribution. And let me draw the parameters for that distribution. So it has some true mean, some population mean for the random variable y. And it has some variance right over here. And I've drawn it roughly normal. Once again, we don't have to assume that it's normal. Because we're going to assume, when we go to the next level, that when we take the samples, we're taking enough samples that the central limit theorem will actually apply. But with that said, let's think about the sampling distributions of each of these random variables. So let's think about the sampling distribution of the sample mean of x. Let's say the sample size over here is going to be equal to n. So what is that going to look like? Well it's going to be some distribution. And we're assuming that n is a fairly large number. So this is going to be a normal distribution. Or it can be approximated with a normal distribution. Let me shift it over a little bit. I'm going to draw it a little bit narrow. Let me draw the mean. So the population mean of the sampling distribution is going to be denoted with this x bar, that tells us the distribution of the means when the sample size is n. And we know that this is going to be the same thing as the population mean for that random variable. And we know from the central limit theorem that the variance of the sampling distribution or, often called the standard error of the mean, is going to be equal to the population variance divided by this n right over here. And if you wanted the standard deviation of this, you just take the square root of both sides. Let's do the same thing for random variable y. Let's take the sampling distribution of the sample mean. But here, we're talking about y, random variable y. And let's just say it has a different sample size. It doesn't have to be a different one. But it just shows you that it doesn't have to be the same. So it has a sample size of m. Let me draw its distribution right over here. Once again, it'll be a narrower distribution than the population distribution. And it will be approximately normal, assuming that we have a large enough sample size. And the mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is going to be the same thing as the population mean. We've seen that multiple times. And its variance for the sample means, or the standard error of the mean. Actually, this isn't the standard error. Standard error would be the square root of this. So if I called this standard error of the mean, that's wrong. The standard error of the mean is the square root of this. It's the standard deviation. This is the variance of the mean. Don't want to confuse you. So the variance of the mean here is going to be the exact same thing. It's going to be the variance of the population divided by our sample size. And everything we've done so far is complete review. It's a little different, because I'm actually doing it with two different random variables. And I'm doing it with two different random variables for a reason. Because now I'm going to define a new random variable. We could just call it z. But z is equal to the difference of our sample means. It's equal to the x sample mean minus the y sample mean. So what does that really mean? Well, to get a sample mean, or at least for this distribution, you're taking n samples from this population over here. Maybe n is 10. You're taking 10 samples and finding its mean. That sample mean is a random variable. Let's say you take 10 samples from here and you get 9.2 when you find their mean. That 9.2 can be viewed as a sample from this distribution right over here. Same thing if this right here is m. Or if m right here is 12. You're taking 12 samples, taking its mean. And that sample mean, maybe it's 15.2, could be viewed as a sample from this distribution. As a sample from the sampling distribution. So what z is, z is a random variable where you're taking n samples from this distribution up here, this population distribution, taking its mean. Then you're taking m samples from this population distribution up here, taking its mean. And then finding the difference between that mean and that mean. So it's another random veritable. But what is the distribution of the z? So let's draw it. Well there's a couple of things we immediately know about z. And we kind of came up with this in the last video. Instead of writing z, I'm just going to write the mean of x bar, which is a sample from the sampling distribution of x, or the sample mean of x, minus the sample mean of y. We saw this in the last video. In fact, I think I still have the work up here. Yeah, I still have the work right up here. The mean of the difference is going to be the difference of the means. The mean of the difference is the same thing is the difference of the means. So the mean of this new distribution right over here is going to be the same thing as the mean of our sample mean minus the mean of our sample mean of y. And this might seem a little abstract in this video. In the next video, we're actually going to do this with concrete numbers. And hopefully it'll make a little bit more sense. And just so you know where we're going with this, the whole point of this is so that we can eventually do some inferential statistics about differences of means. How likely is a difference of means of two samples, random chance or not random chance? Or what is a confidence interval of the difference of means? That's what this is all building up to. So anyway, we know the mean of this distribution right over here. And what's the variance of this distribution? We came up with that result in the last video. If we're taking essentially the difference of two random variables, the variance is going to be the sum of those two random variables. And the whole point of that video is to show that it's not the difference of the variances, it's the sum of the variances. The variance of this new distribution-- and I haven't drawn the distribution yet-- The variance of this new distribution, I'll just write x bar minus y bar, is going to be equal to the sum of the variances of each of these distributions. The variance of x bar plus the variance of y bar. Actually, let me just draw this here. Just so we can visualize another distribution. Although, all I'm going to draw is another normal distribution. Let me scroll down a little bit. So the mean over here, the mean of x bar minus y bar, is going to be equal to the difference of these means over here. I don't have to rewrite it. Let me draw the curve. And notice, I'm drawing a fatter curve than either one. And why am I doing that? Because the variance here is the sum of the variances here. So we're going to have a fatter curve. It's going to have a bigger variance, or a bigger standard deviation than either of these. So then we have some variance here, variance of x bar minus y bar. Now what are these, in terms of the original population distribution? We came up with those results right over here. We know what the standard deviation is. We know that this thing is the same thing as the variance of 1the population distribution divided by n. 1We've done this multiple, multiple times. 1What's this going to be equal to? 1This is right here is the same thing as the variance of our 1population distribution. 1And the x just means this is for random variable x. 1But there's no bar on top. 1This is the actual population distribution, not the sampling 1distribution of the sample mean. 1So that divided by n. 1And then if we want the variance of the sampling 1distribution for y, let me do that in a different color. 1I'll use blue, because that was what we were using for the 1y random variable. 1That's going to be equal to this thing over here. 1And we've done this multiple times. 1Same exact logic as this. 1The population distribution for y divided by m. 1And so once again, I'll just write this out front. 1This is the variance of the differences 1of the sample means. 1And now if you wanted the standard deviation of the 1differences of the sample means, you just have to take 1the square root of both sides of this. 1You take the square root of this, you get the standard 1deviation of the difference of the sample means is equal to 1the square root of the population distribution of x. 1Or the variance of the population distribution of x 1divided by n plus the variance of the population distribution 1of y divided by m. 1And this is just neat. 1Because it kind of looks a little bit 1like a distance formula. 1I'll throw that out there as we get more sophisticated with 1our statistics and try to visualize what all of this 1kind of stuff means in more advanced topics. 1But the whole point of this is, now we can make inferences 1about a difference of means. 1If we have two samples, and we take the means of both of 1those samples and we find some difference, we can make some 1conclusions about how likely that 1difference was just by chance. 1And we're going to do that in the next video.",math_statistics-probability_significance-tests-confidence-intervals-two-samples
" -  One of the most commonly used tools in all of statistics is the notion of a Z-score. And one way to think about a Z-score is it's just the number of standard deviations away from the mean that a certain data point is. So let me write that down. Number of standard deviations. I'll write it like this. Number of standard deviations from our population mean for a particular, particular data point. Now let's make that a little bit concrete. Let's say that you're some type of marine biologist and you've discovered a new species of winged turtles and there's a total of seven winged turtles, the entire population of these winged turtles is seven. And so you go and you're actually able to measure all the winged turtles and you care about their length and you also wanna care about, how are those lengths distributed? Lengths of winged turtles. All right, and let's say, and this is all in centimeters. These are very small turtles. So you discover, and these are all adults. So there's a two centimeter one, there's another two centimeter one. There's a three centimeter one. There's another two centimeter one. There's a five centimeter one, a one centimeter one, and a six centimeter one. So we have seven data points and from this, and I encourage you at any point if you want. Pause this video and see if you wanna calculate, what is the population mean here? We're assuming that this is the population of all the winged turtles. Well, the mean in this situation is going to be equal to, you could add up all these numbers and divide by seven and you would then get three. And then using these data points and the mean you can calculate the population standard deviation. And once again, as review I always encourage you to pause this video and see if you can do it on your own. But I've calculated that ahead of time. The population standard deviation in this situation is approximately, I'll round to the hundredth place, 1.69. So with this information you should be able to calculate the Z-score for each of these data points. Pause this video and see if you can do that. So let me make a new column here. So here I'm gonna put our Z-score. And if you just look at the definition what you're going to do for each of these data points, let's say each data point is x, you're going to subtract from that the mean and then you're going to divide that by the standard deviation. The numerator right over here's gonna tell you how far you are above or below the mean, but you wanna know how many standard deviations you are from the mean, so then you'll divide by the population standard deviation. So for example, this first data point right over here if I wanna calculate the Z-score I will take two. From that I will subtract three and then I will divide by 1.69. I will divide by 1.69. And if you've got a calculator out this is going to be -1 divided by 1.69 and if you use a calculator you would get, this is going to be approximately -0.59. And the Z-score for this data point is going to be the same. That is also going to be -0.59. One way to interpret this is, this is a little bit more than half a standard deviation below the mean, and we could do a similar calculation for data points that are above the mean. Let's say this data point right over here. What is its Z-score? Pause this video and see if you can figure that out. Well, it's going to be six minus our mean, so minus three. All of that over the standard deviation. All of that over 1.69 and this, if you have a calculator, and I calculated it ahead of time, this is going to be approximately 1.77. So more than one, but less than two standard deviations above the mean. I encourage you to pause this video and now try to figure out the Z-scores for these other data points. Now, an obvious question that some of you might be asking is why, why do we care how many standard deviations above or below the mean a data point is? In your future statistical life, Z-scores are gonna be a really useful way to think about how usual or how unusual a certain data point is. And that's going to be really valuable once we start making inferences based on our data. So I will leave you there. Just keep in mind it's a very useful idea, but at the heart of it a fairly simple one. If you know the mean you know the standard deviation. Take your data point, subtract the mean from the data point and then divide by your standard deviation. That gives you your Z-score.",math_ap-statistics_density-curves-normal-distribution-ap
" Let's imagine that I'm here. And this is me at the age-- actually, I'll do this right now-- so let's say at the age of 31. And then I go into the future. So this is a line for the present. And then I go into the future. And this is me again. And this is now at the age of 71. So I've got 40 extra years. I've even picked up a cane to help me walk around. And finally, I go even further in the future, and I'm being very optimistic. And I'm going to go ahead and say this is at the age of 101. I live to be a centennial. And I'm sitting in a wheelchair, and I'm going to wave out at you. So that's me in a wheelchair at the age of 101. And we're going to apply that formula we've been talking about so much, delta P equals Q times R. So I said Q is cardiac output. And we've got R is resistance. So we've got this formula. And let's say I go to the doctor's office. And I go today, and I go in 40 years, and I go again when I'm 101. And today, they tell me my blood pressure is 120 over 80. And actually, I went not too long ago, and that's pretty much what they told me it was. And I go in the future, and in 40 years, they tell me it's actually gone up. My blood pressure is now 150 over 90. And in fact, I go again, when I'm 101, and they say it's 180 over, let's say, 105. So the blood pressure is rising, and that's basically what I'm told. And they say, well, you've got to make sure you eat well and exercise, and that should help your blood pressure. And I'm left wondering what the connection is between the two. So let's figure out what that connection is exactly. So my blood pressure, I just said, is 120 over 80. And if I want to figure out my mean arterial pressure, meaning the average pressure in my arteries, I can actually use my blood pressure to give me a good guess as to what it's going to be. So I know that I spend about 1/3-- my mean arterial pressure is going to equal 1/3 times my systolic, because I know I spend about 1/3 of the time-- my heart does anyway-- spends 1/3 of its time beating. And it spends 2/3 of its time relaxing. And the relaxing pressure is the diastolic pressure, that's 80. And so that works out to about 95. And so that's how I came up with that 95 number. And that's also why it's not exactly 100, which is what you'd think an average would be between two numbers. But it's because we don't spend the exact same amount of time in systole as diastole. So then if I wanted to figure out here, it would be 1/3 times 150 plus 2/3 times 90. And that works out to 110. And if I wanted to do it at the age of 101, my mean arterial pressure would be 1/3 times 180 plus 2/3 times 105. And that works out to 130. So I figured out my mean arterial pressure. Let me write that with a line. I also need my mean venous pressure, because we know we're going to have to subtract the two from one another to get the delta P, delta meaning the difference. So mean venous pressure right now is about 5. And let's assume-- this is one of a few assumptions we're going to make-- let's assume that it doesn't change, that over a few years, it really stays around the same. It's about 5. Well, then if I know that, my delta P is easy to figure out, right. I can just take 95 minus 5, and that'll get me 90. And I can take 110 minus 5, and that's 105. And I can take 130 minus 5, and that's 125. So I figured out my delta P, which is basically my mean arterial pressure minus my mean venous pressure, and that equals my delta P. OK, so far so good. Now let me change colors to figure out my Q, my flow. And right now, I have, let's say, a stroke volume-- I'll write it up here-- stroke volume, meaning each time my heart beats, about 70 milliliters of blood go out. So each time my heart beats, it sends out to the rest of the body 70 ml of blood. And that's based on the fact that I'm about 70 kilos. And my heart rate is about 70, very relaxed heart rate. And let's assume, just as we did with the mean venous pressure, that that doesn't change. So this is not going to change over time. So this works out to about 5 liters a minute because Q is simply-- let me write that here-- Q is simply SV times HR. And so I'm just multiplying those two numbers together, and you get about 5 liters a minute, and it doesn't change over time. So 5 liters a minute here, 5 liters a minute here. And I should probably mention all of my pressure units should be millimeters of mercury. I didn't write that, just to not clutter up the board. But let's just assume that-- well, it's not assuming. It is millimeters of mercury. So now using my equation, I can now say, well, delta P-- and actually maybe up here I should even change this. It should be blue so that I'm consistent. So delta P equals Q times R. So if delta P is 90 and Q is 5, my resistance equals 18. Right? It's just a bit of math that I did very quickly. But 18 times 5 is 90. And here I could figure it out. 105 divided by 5 would give me a resistance of 21. And here, I would figure out that it's going to be 25. So one thing that I've been told by my doctor is my blood pressure is rising. And two things that I've assumed are that my mean venous pressure is the same, and that my cardiac output is the same. And if I assume that, and that's definitely not true for everybody, but if I assume that for me, then that means that my resistance has gone up. Over time, my resistance has gone up. And let's now change screens and figure out how that could possibly happen. So let me draw myself out again. So I've got three versions of me. I've got the present me at the age of 31. I've got the future me with a cane at the age of 71. And I've got the really old version of myself living at a ripe, old age of 101, waving, in fact. So three versions of myself. And if I was to draw my arterial tree, let's say, a simplified version of my arterial tree. Let's say here's a vessel coming through, and I've got, let's say, another vessel, and this branches here. And I've got a third vessel, and this branches here. Right now my arterial tree looks pretty good, pretty clean. And that's why my resistance was 18. Blood is flowing through very smoothly. It's going out this way to feed the kidney and maybe to my ears and my eyes and my foot. And it's basically making its way through, no trouble. Now at the age of 71, something happens. Actually, let me just draw a little divider line. At the age of 71, something happens. I have, let's say, the same arterial tree. I'll try to draw it the same way. Except now, I've been eating, for 40 years, foods that are not the best. And I certainly haven't exercised a whole heck of a lot. I haven't gone to the gym very often. And now I've got buildup of plaque. So let's say I've got a plaque right there. And I've got a plaque, let's say, another one right there. And let's say I have a plaque right there. So I've got three little plaques. And we'll get into plaque and what it's made of exactly in a future video. But for the moment, just think of it as something that's blocking up that vessel. And it's usually made of fatty substances and macrophages and cells that have died and all sorts of basically crud that fills up the vessels. And so, because it's filled up the vessels, now here, my radius got smaller. My vessel radius in here got smaller. And over here, it got smaller. So blood, as it's flowing through, is having a tougher time getting through because the radius is smaller in these spots. And, as you know, if you calculate total resistance-- and that's what, actually, this is, total resistance-- the total resistance will start to slowly climb up. And in this case, maybe it climbs up to 21. And now years go by, let's say 30 more years go by. I'm now in a wheelchair. And I continue to not eat so well. I eat the same sort of fast food that isn't healthy for me, but I can't possibly stop because I find it tasty. And at the end of the day, my vessels look like this. I have that same one as before, let's say. And let's say this one actually grew longer. So instead of just being part of the vessel, let's say it's huge now. This one got very big. And let's say this one up here actually continued and grew a little bit as well. But I also picked up another one right here, let's say. And I also got one right here. So I have a few more blocks in the road. And so now my blood is having a real hard time 1getting through because it's got more obstruction to flow. 1All my paths have a smaller radius. 1And we know, and I've mentioned a number of times 1now, about the relationship between a radius 1and resistance. 1And that as the radius everywhere gets smaller, 1the resistance is going to get bigger. 1And so my total resistance here, let's say, is about 25. 1So now you can see how eating a certain way and not exercising 1is going to lead to potentially developing these plaques that 1act as roadblocks and get in the way of blood flow. 1And the reason that that's a problem is that, as we see now, 1the radius gets smaller, the resistance goes up. 1And in the previous slide here, we actually 1can see now that as the resistance goes up, 1assuming that the other things kind of stay the same, 1your blood pressure can go up. 1And so when you hear, in the doctor's office, 1that you have a blood pressure of a certain number 1over a certain number, that's one thing that we can measure. 1And what it tells you is a little bit 1of information about some of the things that we can't easily 1measure, such as resistance. 1So let's stop there, and we'll pick up.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system
" -  Let's see if we can find the limit as x approaches negative 1 of x plus 1 over the square root of x plus 5 minus 2. So, our first reaction might just be, okay, well let's just use our limit properties a little bit, this is going to be the same thing as the limit as x approaches negative 1 of x plus 1 over, over the limit, the limit as x approaches negative 1 of square root of x plus 5 minus 2. And then we could say, all right, this thing up here, x plus 1, if this is, if we think about the graph y equals x plus 1, it's continuous everywhere, especially at x equals negative 1, and so to evaluate this limit, we just have to evaluate this expression at x equals negative 1, so this numerator's just going to evaluate to negative 1 plus 1. And then our denominator, square root of x plus 5 minus 2 isn't continuous everywhere but it is continuous at x equals negative 1 and so we can do the same thing. We can just substitute negative 1 for x, so this is going to be the square root of negative 1 plus 5 minus 2. Now, what does this evaluate to? Well, in the numerator we get a zero, and in the denominator, negative 1 plus 5 is 4, take the principle root is 2, minus 2, we get zero again, so we get, we got zero over zero. Now, when you see that, you might be tempted to give up. You say, oh, look, there's a zero in the denominator, maybe this limit doesn't exist, maybe I'm done here, what do I do? And if this was non-zero up here in the numerator, if you're taking a non-zero value and dividing it by zero, that is undefined and your limit would not exist. But when you have zero over zero, this is indeterminate form, it doesn't mean necessarily that your limit does not exist, and as we'll see in this video and many future ones, there are tools at our disposal to address this, and we will look at one of them. Now, the tool that we're going to look at is is there another way of rewriting this expression so we can evaluate its limit without getting the zero over zero? Well, let's just rewrite, let's just take this and give it, so let's take this thing right over here, and let's say this is g of x, so essentially what we're trying to do is find the limit of g of x as x approaches negative 1, so we can write g of x is equal to x plus 1 and the only reason I'm defining it as g of x is just to be able to think of it more clearly as a function and manipulate the function and then think about similar functions, over x plus 5 minus 2, or x plus 1 over the square root of x plus 5 minus 2. Now, the technique we're going to use is when you get this indeterminate form and if you have a square root in either the numerator or the denominator, it might help to get rid of that square root and this is often called rationalizing the expression. In this case, you have a square root in the denominator, so it would be rationalizing the denominator, and so, this would be, the way we would do it is we would be leveraging our knowledge of difference of squares. We know, we know that a plus b times a minus b is equal to a squared minus b squared, you learned that in algebra a little while ago, or if we had the square root of a plus b and we were to multiply that times the square root of a minus b, well that would be the square root of a squared which is just going to be a, minus b squared, so we can just leverage these ideas to get rid of this radical down here. The way we're going to do it is we're going to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the square root of x plus 5 plus 2, right? We have the minus 2 so we multiply it times the plus 2, so let's do that. So we have square root of x plus 5 plus 2 and we're going to multiply the numerator times the same thing, 'cause we don't want to change the value of the expression. This is 1. So, if we take the expression divided by the same expression it's going to be 1, so this is, so square root of x plus 5 plus 2 and so this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to x plus 1 times the square root, times the square root of x plus 5 plus 2 and then the denominator is going to be, well, it's going to be x, the square root of x plus 5 squared which would be just x plus 5 and then minus 2 squared, minus 4, and so this down here simplifies to x plus 5 minus 4 is just x plus 1 so this is just, this is just x plus 1 and it probably jumps out at you that both the numerator and the denominator have an x plus 1 in it, so maybe we can simplify, so we can simplify by just say, well, g of x is equal to the square root of x plus 5 plus 2. Now, some of you might be feeling a little off here, and you would be correct. Your spider senses would be, is this, is this definitely the same thing as what we originally had before we cancelled out the x plus 1s? And the answer is the way I just wrote it is not the exact same thing. It is the exact same thing everywhere except at x equals negative 1. This thing right over here is defined at x equals negative 1. This thing right over here is not defined at x equals negative 1, and g of x was not, was not, so g of x right over here, you don't get a good result when you try x equals negative 1 and so in order for this to truly be the same thing as g of x, the same function, we have to say for x not equal to negative 1. Now, this is a simplified version of g of x. It is the same thing. For any input x, that g of x is defined, this is going to give you the same output, and this is the exact same domain now, now that we've put this constraint in, as g of x. Now you might say, okay, well how does this help us? Because we want to find the limit as x approaches negative 1 and even here, I had to put this little constraint here that x cannot be equal to negative 1. How do we think about this limit? Well, lucky for us, we know, lucky for us we know that if we just take another function, f of x, if we say f of x is equal to the square root of x plus 5 plus 2, well then we know that f of x is equal to g of x for all x not equal to negative 1 because f of x does not have that constraint. And we know if this is true of two, if this is true of two functions, then the limit as x approaches, the limit, let me write this down, since we know this, because of this, we know that the limit of f of x as x approaches negative 1 is going to be equal to the limit of g of x as x approaches negative 1, and this of course is what we want to figure out, what was the beginning of the problem, but we can now use f of x here, because only at x equals negative 1 that they are not the same, and if you were to graph g of x it just has a, it has a point discontinuity, or removable discont-- or, I should say, yeah, a point discontinuity right over here at x equals negative 1, and so what is the limit? And we are in the home stretch now. What is the limit of f of x? Well, we could say the limit of the square root of x plus 5 plus 2 as x approaches negative 1, well, this expression is continuous. Or, this function is continuous at x equals negative 1 so we can just evaluate it at x equals negative 1, so this is going to be the square root of negative 1 plus 5 plus 2, so this is 4 square root, principle root of 4 is 2, 2 plus 2 is equal to 4. So since the limit of f of x as x approaches negative 1 is 4, the limit of g of x as x approaches negative 1 is also 4, and if this little, this little, I guess you could say leap that I just made over here doesn't make sense to you, think about it, think about it visually. Think about it visually. So if this is my y-axis and this is my x-axis, g of x looked something like this. G of x, g of x, let me draw it, g of x looked something, something like this, and it had a gap at negative 1, so it had a gap right over there, while f of x, f of x would have the same graph except it wouldn't have, it wouldn't have the gap, and so if you're trying to find the limit, it seems completely reasonable, well let's just use f of x and evaluate what f of x would be to kind of fill that gap at x equals negative 1, so hopefully this graphical version helps a little bit or if it confuses you, ignore it.",math_old-differential-calculus_limits-from-equations-dc
" -  So, I have three different functions here. I know they're all called f, but we're gonna just assume they are different functions. And, for each of these, I want to do three things. I want to find the zeros. And so, the zeros are the input values that make the value of the function equal to zero. So, here it'd be the t values that make f of t equal zero. Here, it'd be the x values that make the function equal zero. So, I want to find the zeros. I also want to find the coordinates of the vertex. And finally, I want to find the equation of the line of symmetry. Line of symmetry. And in particular, to make it a little bit more specific, the vertical line of symmetry, which will actually be the only line of symmetry for these three. So, pause the video and see if you can figure out the zeros, the vertex, and the line of symmetry. And I'm assuming you just did that and now I am going to attempt to do it. And if, at any point, you get inspired pause the video again and keep on working on it. The best way to learn this stuff is to do it yourself. So, let's see, so let's first find the zeros. So, to find the zeros, we can set t minus five squared, minus nine, equal to zero. So, we could say t ... for what t's does t minus five squared, minus nine, equal zero? Let's see, to solve this, we could add nine to both sides. And so we could say, if we add nine to both sides the lefthand side's just t minus five squared. The righthand side is going to be nine. And so, if t minus five squared is nine, that means that t minus five could be equal to the positive square root of nine or t minus five could equal the negative square root of nine. And to solve for t, we could add five to both sides, so we get t is equal to eight or t is equal to, if we add five to both sides here, t is equal to two. And just like that, we have found the zeros for this function because if t is equal to eight or two, the function is going to be zero. F of eight is zero and f of two is going to be zero. Now, let's find the vertex, the coordinates of the vertex. The coordinates of the vertex. So, the x coordinate of the vertex, or sorry, I should say the t coordinate of the vertex since the input variable here is t, the t coordinate of the vertex is going to be halfway in between the zeros. It's going to be halfway in between where the parabola, in this case, is going to intersect the x axis, or the t axis, I keep saying x axis, the t axis for this case. So, halfway between eight and two. Well, it's gonna be the average of them. Eight plus two, over two. That's ten over two, that's five. The t coordinate is five and five is three away from eight and three away from two. And, when t is equal to five, what is f of t? What is f of five? Well, when t is equal to five, five minus five squared is just zero. And then, f of five is just going to be negative nine. And this form of a function, this is actually called vertex form because it's very easy to pick out the vertex. It's very easy to realize, like, okay look, for this particular one, we're going to hit a minimum point when this part of the expression is equal to zero because this thing, the lowest value it can take on is zero cause you're squaring it, it can never take on a negative value. And it takes on zero when t is equal to five. And when that's, if this part is zero, then the f of five is going to be negative nine. So, just like that, we have established the vertex. Now, we actually have a lot of information if we wanted to draw it. So, if we want to draw this function. I'll just do a very quick sketch of it. Whoops. So, a very quick sketch of it. So, that is our t axis, not our x axis, I have to keep reminding myself. And that is my, let's call that my y axis. And we're going to graph y is equal to f of t. Well, we know the vertex is at the point five comma negative nine. So, this is, t is equal to five and y is equal to negative nine, so that's the vertex right over there. And then, we know we have zeros at t equals eight and t equals two. So, t equals eight and t equals two. Let me make that a little bit in, t equals two. Those are the two zeros. So, eight and two. And so, just like that, we can graph f of t, or we can graph y is equal to f of t. So, y is equal to f of t is going to look something like let me draw it a little ... something like that That's the graph of y is equal to f of t. Now, the last thing that I said is the line of symmetry. Well, the line of symmetry is going to be the vertical line that goes through the vertex. So, the equation of that line of symmetry is going to be t is equal to five. That's really just the t coordinate of the vertex. That defines the line of symmetry. Let's do the other two right over here. So, what are the zeros? Well, if you set this equal to zero, if we say x plus two times x plus four is equal to zero, well that's going to happen if x plus two is equal to zero or x plus four is equal to zero. This is going to happen if we subtract two from both sides, when x is negative two, and if we subtract four from both sides, or when x is equal to negative four. As we said, the vertex, the x coordinate of the vertex, is going to be halfway in between these. So, it's going to be negative two plus negative four, over two, so that would be negative six, over two, which is just negative three. Negative three. And when x is negative three, f of x is going to be, let's see, it's going to be negative one times one, right? Negative three plus two is negative one, and so times one. So, it's just going to be negative one. There you have it. And the line of symmetry is going to be the vertical line x is equal to negative three. And once again, we can graph that really fast. So, let me, this is my y axis. See everything is happening for negative x's, so I'll draw it a little bit more skewed this way. This is my x axis. And we see that we have zeros at x equals negative two and x is equal to negative four. So, negative one, two, three, four. So, we have zeros there, negative two, be careful. Negative two and negative four. And the vertex is at negative three comma negaitve one. So, negative three comma negative one. Make sure we see that, so this is negative one right over here, negative one. This is negative two, this is negative four. And so we can sketch out what the graph of y is equal to f of x is going to look like. It's gonna look something like that. That is y is equal to f of x. Let's do one more. Hopefully, we're getting the hang of this. So, here, to solve x squared, plus six x, plus eight is equal to zero, it will be useful to factor this. And so, this can be written as, and if you have trouble doing this, I encourage you to watch videos on factoring polynomials, What adds up to six and when you take their product is eight? Well, four and two. Four plus two is six and four times two is eight. So, is equal to zero. And then, this is actually the exact same thing as what we have in blue right over here. These are actually the exact same function. They're just written in different forms. And so, the solutions are gonna be the exact solutions that we just saw right over here and the graph is going to be the same thing that we have right over there. So, same vertex, same line of symmetry, same zeros. These functions were just written in different ways.",math_math2_quad-2
" The following table describes the relationship between the number of servings of spaghetti bolognese-- I don't know if I'm pronouncing that-- or bolognese, and the number of tomatoes needed to prepare them. Test the ratios for equivalents, and determine whether the relationship is proportional. Well, you have a proportional relationship between the number of servings and the number of tomatoes is if the ratio of the number of servings to the number of tomatoes is always the same. Or if the ratio of the number of tomatoes to the number of servings is always the same. So let's just think about the ratio of the number of tomatoes to the number of servings. So it's 10 to 6, which is the same thing as 5 to 3. So here the ratio is 5 to 3. 15 to 9, if you divide both of these by 3, you get 5 to 3. So it's the same ratio. 15 to 25, if you divide both of these by 5, you get 5 to 3. So based on this data, it looks like the ratio between the number of tomatoes and the number of servings is always constant. So yes, this relationship is proportional.",math_cc-seventh-grade-math_cc-7th-ratio-proportion
" -  What I wanna do in this video is figure out multiple ways to express the area of the entire large rectangle, which we see is made up of these six smaller rectangles. So there's a couple of ways that we can do it. One way is, we can just multiply the height of this big rectangle times the width of this big rectangle. So what's its height? Well, from here to here, that distance is going to be y squared, and then from there to there, that distance is going to be negative 6y. And I know what you're thinking. How can my distance be negative 6y? Isn't a distance always positive? Well, even negative 6y can be positive if y is negative, so it's completely reasonable to say, well, this distance could be negative 6y. So the entire height right over here is going to be, it's going to be y squared minus 6y. Or you could do it as y squared plus this distance, which is negative 6y, y squared plus negative 6y, which is the same thing as y squared minus 6y. So that's the height of this big rectangle. What's its width? Well, the width is going to be the width of this purple rectangle, it's going to be 3y squared, plus the width of this yellow rectangle, which is negative 2y, and that can have a negative out here, the same logic why this could have a negative, why the negative 6y could have a negative, and then plus the width of the blue rectangle. And so if you add them all together, the width of the entire rectangle is going to be 3y squared minus 2y, minus 2y plus one. And just like that, this expression that I just wrote down will give us the area for the entire, the area for the entire big rectangle. Now, there's another way to do it, and a big clue was that we subdivided the big rectangle into these six smaller rectangles, and we have the dimensions for the six smaller rectangles. And so we could find the area for each of these, and then we could add them all together. So let's look at this first one. Height times width. The area of this purple rectangle is gonna be the height, y squared, times the width, which is 3y squared, which is going to be equal to, it's gonna be three, and then y squared times y squared is y to the fourth power. What's the area of this yellow rectangle? Height is y squared. It's going to be y squared times the width, times negative 2y, which is going to give us negative 2y to the third power. What about the blue one? Well, height times width, it's gonna be y squared times one, which, of course, is just going to be equal to y squared. Now, this green one, it's gonna be the height, which is now negative 6y, times the width, which is 3y squared, which is going to be equal to, let's see, negative six times three is negative 18, and then y times y squared is y to the third power. Now, the area of this gray rectangle is gonna be the height, which is negative 6y, times the width, which is negative 2y, which gets us negative six times negative two is positive 12, y times y is y squared. And then finally the area of this rectangle right over here, it's gonna be the height, which is negative 6y, times the width, which is just one, which is equal to negative 6y. And so if we want the area of this entire rectangle, we can just add up the areas of the smaller ones, so it's going to be equal to the three, it's going to be equal to the 3y to the fourth, 3y to the fourth, plus negative 2y to the third power. Let me write this in a color that corresponds to that. Negative 2y to the third power, plus y squared, plus y squared, minus 18y to the third power, so minus 18y to the third power, plus 12y squared. Let's write that in black. So plus 12y squared, and then last but not least, we have the minus 6y, minus 6y. So this is an expression for the area of the entire thing, but we can simplify it more. So let's see, we only have one fourth degree term, so I'll just rewrite that. So we have one fourth degree term, so I'll just rewrite that. 3y to the fourth power. Now, how many third degree terms do we have? We have negative 2y to the third power. We have negative 18y to the third power. So if we add these two together, how many y to the third powers do we have? Well, negative two plus negative 18 is negative 20, negative 20y to the third power. And then how many second degree terms do we have? Well, we have one y squared right over here, and then we have another, 12y squareds. You add those together, you're gonna have 13y squareds. And then finally we still need to subtract the 6y. And there you have it, another expression for the area of the entire rectangle. And the whole point of doing this is to realize that this up here and this down here are equivalent, and that the way that we multiply this actually corresponds to exactly how we found the areas of the smaller rectangles right over here. You would say y squared times 3y squared is 3y fourth. Y squared times negative 2y is negative 2y to the third power. Y squared times one is y squared, which is exactly what we did when we found the area of these rectangles in this, I guess you could say, in this top row. And then you would take the negative six, and you would say negative six times 3y squared is negative 18y to the third. Negative six times negative 2y is positive 12y squared. Negative 6y times one is negative 6y. And just to realize that this isn't just some type of voodoo that we're doing. It completely makes sense when you think about in terms of an area model like this.",math_math3_poly-arithmetic
" - Vinayak drives in a uniform circular motion of radius seven kilometers. If it takes two hours to complete one round, find his speed. It's given to take pi as 22 over seven. So let's think about what's given to us. We're given that Vinayak is driving in, I don't know which way, but he's driving in a uniform circular motion of radius seven kilometers. So let's say he's driving a car on his circular track. Then the radius of this track, the radius of this circular track, is given to be seven kilometers. Seven kilometers. And it takes him two hours to complete one round. So, for him to complete one entire round, it takes him two hours. So the time for that, so let me just write that as two hours, it takes him two hours for one round. What we need to calculate is the speed. Now the important thing to notice over here is given that Vinayak is driving in a uniform circular motion. What does that mean? What is the meaning of uniform circular motion? It just means that the speed of this car is a constant. As it goes over the entire circular part, its speed does not change, its speed is a constant. And because the speed is a constant, we can just go ahead and use speed equals distance over time. That's how we always calculate speed, right? Provided speed is a constant. If speed is changing, then we can't do this, because then this number keeps changing, isn't it. So, let's see what the distance is, and let's see what the time is. We have to calculate what the speed is, right? So what is the distance traveled? In one round, in one complete round, what is the distance traveled. Well, the distance is this path, this path length, and that is the circumference of the circle, right? So the distance traveled is this circumference. And how do we calculate the circumference of any circle? We calculate it as two pi r. That's where the pi comes. And for that one entire round, we know the time. The time taken is two hours. So let's just write that down. Time is two hours. And of course since the units are not in standard, we have hours and we have kilometers, we need to be careful, we'll just put the numbers with the units. And so if we substitute, let's write that down over here, speed equals two pi. They ask us to take pi 22 over seven. It's not exactly 22 over seven, but they've asked us to do that so the calculations become simpler. Times the radius. The radius is seven kilometers, right, with the units. Divide by two hours. And let's see how much we get. We get, this cancels, and this cancels. So we end up with 22, right, that's all. Twenty-two, that's it. So that's the speed. The speed of our vehicle is going to be 22 kilometers per hour. All right, let's do one more. An ant is traveling in a uniform circular motion with a speed of 11 meters per second. If the radius of that circle is 21 meters, find the time taken to cover half a round. So a very similar problem, but a slight difference, right? The difference over here is we're asked to calculate the time taken. We're given the speed and time taken to cover half a round. So, can you try this? Go ahead, give it a shot. Okay, again, let's make a drawing. I'm going to do the same drawing as before. So let's imagine now this is our ant. It's given that the radius of the circle is 21 meters. So this time this radius becomes 21 meters. And we are given the speed, we know the speed of this ant. So the speed of that ant is 11 meters per second. And we are asked to calculate the time taken. How much time it takes to cover half a round. That means we should only think about half a round, so that's from here all the way to here, that's it. Only from here to here. Okay, so again, because it's a uniform circular motion, the speed is a constant. So we can just go ahead and use speed equals distance over time. Distance over time. And since time is asked, well let's rearrange the equation. If we rearrange we get time equals distance over speed. Distance over speed. And speed is given to us. We can figure out what the distance is. We should only think about the distance for half a round, because only for half a round I need to calculate the time. So again, if you couldn't do this earlier, no problem. Now again, can you see if you can give it a shot. Good, give it a shot. All right, so if we substitute, what is the distance? Since we are only now concerned for half a round, the distance will be half the circumference. A full circumference is two pi r, so half the circumference will be just pi r. Right, divide by 2, isn't it? Two pi r is full circumference, so half of that is just pi r. Makes sense, right? Divide by speed, is given as 11 meters per second. Now everything is in SI, we don't have to use the units, but it's okay, let's put in the units no problem. So time will be pi, what shall we do for pi? Now I should have mentioned in the problem, pi is 22 by seven. So here also, let's take it to be 22 by seven. Assume that it's given in the problem itself, even though I have not written that. So, pi is 22 by seven. Times r, r is 21 meters. Divided by 11 meters per second. Okay, we have some fractions in the numerator, so let's be very careful over here. Ah, let's see if something cancels out. Yes, seven goes one time, seven goes three times. So, this will be, we get 22 times three, I will not multiply, because I have to do another division. Divide by 11 meters per second. Eleven goes two times, and I end up with six. Six. And the meter cancels, and the one over second becomes second. So I end up with six seconds. And so, the ant takes six seconds to complete half a round. So what we see is whenever we are dealing with uniform circular motion, we can always use speed is distance by time, going back to the old formula. And, the only thing is, when it comes to the distance, we just have to use the circumference formula. If it's a full round it will be two pi r, if it's a half a round, it will just be pi r.",science_in-in-class9th-physics-india_in-in-motion
" - [Teacher] A candy machine creates small chocolate wafers in the shape of circular discs. The diameter, the diameter of each wafer is 16 millimeters. What is the area of each candy? So, the candy, they say it's the shape of circular discs. And they tell us that the diameter of each wafer is 16 millimeters. So if I draw a line across the circle that goes through the center, the length of that line all the way across the circle through the center is 16 millimeters. So let me write that, so diameter, the diameter here is 16 millimeters and they want us to figure out the area, the area of the surface of this candy. Or essentially the area of this circle. And so when we think about area, we know that the area of a circle, the area of a circle is equal to pi times the radius of the circle squared. Times the radius of the circle squared, and you say, well they gave us the diameter, what is the radius? Well, you might remember the radius is half of diameter, so distance from the center of the circle to the outside, to the boundary of the circle. So it would be this distance right over here, which is exactly half of the diameter. So, it would be eight millimeters. So, where we see the radius, we could put eight millimeters. So the area is going to be equal to pi times eight millimeters squared, which would be 64, 64 square, 64 square millimeters. And typically, this is written with pi after the 64, so you might often see it as this is equal to 64 pi, 64 pi millimeters squared, millimeters squared, millimeters squared. Now, this is the answer, 64 pi millimeters squared, but sometimes it's not so satisfying to just leave this pi, you might say, ""Well, I wanna get a estimate of what number ""this is close to, I wanna decimal representation of this."" And so we can start to use approximate values of pi. So, the most rough approximate value that tends to be used is saying that pi, a very rough approximation is equal to 3.14. So in that case, we could say that this is going to be equal to 64, 64 times 3.14 millimeters, millimeters squared and we can get our calculator to figure out what this will be in decimal form. So we have 64 times 3.14 gives us 200.96. So we could say that the area is approximately equal to, approximately equal to 200.96 square millimeters. Now, if we wanna get a more accurate representation of this, pi actually just keeps going on and on and on forever, we could use the calculator's internal representation of pi. In which case we'll say 64 times and then we have to look for the pi in the calculator, it's up here in this yellow so I'll do this little second function, get the pi there, every calculator will be a little different. But 64 times pi, now we're going to use the calculator's internal approximation of pi, which is going to be more precise than what I had in the last one and you get 201, so let me put it over here so I can write it down, so a more precise is 201, and I'll round, I'll round to the nearest, I'll round to the nearest hundredth so you get 201.06, so 201, so more precise is 201.06 square millimeters. So this is closer to the actual answer 'cause a calculator's representation is more precise than this very rough approximation of what pi is.",math_8th-grade-foundations-engageny_8th-m5-engage-ny-foundations
" What I want to explore in this video is, given some length of string or a line or some line segment right here, b, can I set up an a, so that the ratio of a to b is equal to the ratio of the sum of these two to the longer side? So it's equal to the ratio of a plus b to a. So I want to sit and think about this a little bit. I want to see is can I construct some a that's on this ratio, this perfect ratio that I'm somehow referring to right here, so that the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side is equal to the ratio of the whole thing to the longer side. And let's just assume that we can find a ratio like that. And we'll call it phi. We'll use the Greek letter phi for that ratio over there. So let's see what we can learn about this special ratio phi. Well if phi is equal to a over b, which is equal to a plus b over a, we know that a plus b over a is the same thing as a over a plus b over a. a over a is just 1. And b over a is just the inverse of this statement right over here. So b over a-- this thing right here over here is phi-- so b over a is going to be 1 over phi. This is going to be 1 over phi. So this is interesting. We've now set up a number, which we're going to call this special ratio, phi is equal to 1 plus 1 over phi. Well just that is kind of a neat statement right over there. First of all, you could, if you subtract 1 from both sides of this, you get phi minus 1 is equal to its inverse. That seems to be a pretty neat property of any number that if I just subtract 1 from it, I get its multiplicative inverse. And so that, already that seems kind of intriguing. But then even this statement over here is kind of interesting because we've defined phi in terms of 1 plus 1 over phi. So we can actually think of it this way. We could say that phi is equal to 1 plus 1 over phi. But instead of writing phi, we're saying, wait, phi is just 1 plus 1 over-- instead of saying phi-- I could say, well, that's just 1 plus 1 over and I could just write phi again or I could just keep on going. I could just keep on going like this forever. I could say that's 1 over 1 plus 1 over and just keep on going on and on and on, forever. And this is a recursive definition of a function, or a recursive definition of a variable, where it's defined in terms of itself. But even this seems like a pretty neat property. But we want to get a little bit further into it. We actually eventually want to figure out what phi is. What is the value of phi, this weird number, this weird ratio that we're beginning to explore? So let's see if we can turn it into a quadratic equation that we can solve using fairly traditional methods. And the easiest way to do that is to multiply both sides of this equation by phi. And then you get phi squared-- let me write a little bit different-- phi squared is equal to phi plus 1. phi squared is equal to phi plus 1. And then, actually, I'm going to take a little bit of a side here. But even this is interesting, because then if we take the square root of both sides of this, you get-- let me scroll down a little bit-- you get phi is equal to the square root of-- and I'll just switch the order here-- the square root of 1 plus phi. So once again, we can set up another recursive definition. phi is equal to the square root of 1 plus phi. And I could write phi there, but hey, phi is equal to the square root of 1 plus and I could write phi there, but hey, phi is just equal to the square root of 1 plus, the square root of 1 plus. And we could just keep going on and on like this forever. So even this is neat. The same number that can be expressed this way, the same number where if I just subtract 1 from it, you get its inverse. It can also be expressed in these kind of recursive square roots underneath each other. So this is already starting to get very, very, very intriguing, but let's get back to business. Let's actually solve for this magic number, this magic ratio that we started thinking about. And really from a very simple idea, that the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side is equal to the ratio of the sum of the two to the longer side. So let's just solve this as a traditional quadratic. Let's get everything on the left-hand side. So we're going to subtract phi plus 1 from both sides. And we get phi squared minus phi minus 1 is equal to 0. And we can solve for phi now using the quadratic formula, which we've proven in other videos. You can prove using completing the square. But the quadratic formula you say, negative b. Negative b is the coefficient on this term right here. So let me just write it down, a is equal to 1, that's the coefficient on this term. b is equal to negative 1, that's the coefficient on this term. c is equal to negative 1, that's the coefficient, or it's really the constant term right over there. So the solutions to this, phi-- and we're actually only going to care about the positive solution because we're thinking about a positive-- when we go to our original problem here, we're assuming that these are both positive distances, so we care about a positive value right over here. We get phi is equal to-- do it in orange-- negative b. Well negative negative 1 is 1 plus or minus the square root of b squared. b squared is going to be 1 minus 4ac. a is 1, c is negative 1. So negative 4 times negative 1 is positive 4. So 1 plus 4, all of that over 2a. So a is 1, so all of that over 2. So phi is equal to 1. And once again, we only care about the positive solution here. This is going to be the square root of 5. If you have 1 minus the square root of 5, you're going to get a negative in the numerator. So we only care about the positive solution. 1 plus the square root of 5 over 2. So this seems like a pretty interesting number. Let's actually take a calculator out and see if we can get the first few places of this magic number phi. So let me get my calculator out. Let's just actually evaluate it. And you might recognize that square root of 5 is an irrational number. And so this whole thing is going to be an irrational number, but I'll prove that in another video, which means it never repeats. It goes on and on and on forever. But let's actually evaluate it. So it's 1 plus the square root of 5 divided by 2. So it says 1.6180339. So let me put that aside. Let me write it down. And this is where it starts to get really interesting and mysterious. So this number right over here is 1.618033988 and it just keeps on going on and on and on, keeps on never terminating, never repeating. So that by itself, it's this cool number. It's this ratio that has all of these neat properties, which are pretty crazy anyway that you express it. But what's really neat is if we revisit this thing right over here. Because what is 1 over phi going to be? So 1 over phi, which we sometimes denote with a capital phi. We already know 1 over phi is just phi minus 1. So we actually can do this in our heads. 1 over this is just going to be 0.618033988. I don't know. There's just something wacky about that, that the inverse of the number is really just the decimals left over after you get rid of the 1. That, by itself, is kind of a crazy idea. But it gets even crazier because this number is showing up everywhere. And as you might imagine from the title of this video, this phi right over here, this is called the golden ratio. This is the golden ratio and it shows up everywhere. It shows up in art. It shows up in music. It shows up in nature. And just to get an idea of where it shows up in nature, it shows up in very pure ideas. So if I were to just draw a perfect star, if I were to just draw a regular star like this. Let me just draw it like this. I'll draw it right over here. So this is just a regular star. All the lengths are equal. So I want to draw it a little bit better than that. So if I just draw a star like this right over here or sometimes this would be called a pentagram, some amazing things start to happen here. The ratio of this pink side to this blue length right over here, that's the golden ratio. The ratio of this magenta to this pink is the golden ratio, as it should, by definition. Now the ratio of the magenta to this orange is also the golden ratio. It just keeps on showing up in a ton of different ways when you look at a pentagram like this. If you look at something like a pentagon, a regular pentagon where all the angles are the same and all the sides are the same, a regular pentagon. If you take any of the diagonals of a regular pentagon, so right over here, if you take this diagonal right over here, the ratio of this green side to--and when I'm talking about the diagonals, ones that actually aren't one of the edges-- the ratio of any of the diagonals to any of the sides is once again, this golden ratio. So it keeps showing up on and on and on. And we can do interesting things with the golden ratio. Let's say that we had a rectangle, where the ratio of the width to the height is the golden ratio. So let's try that out. So let's say that this is its height. This is its width. And that the ratio-- So let's call this a. 1Let's call this b. 1And the ratio of a to b is equal to phi. 1That 1.61 so on and so forth. 1Let me scroll down a little bit. 1So that is going to be equal to phi. 1So that's something interesting to do. 1Maybe that's a nice looking rectangle of some sort. 1But let me put out a square here. 1So let me separate this into a b by b square. 1So this is a b by b square right over here. 1And then-- actually let me do it a little bit, let me draw it 1a little bit differently, this rectangle actually 1isn't exactly the way I would want to draw it-- 1so the ratio might look a little bit like this. 1So the ratio of the width to the length, 1or the width to the height, is going to be the golden ratio. 1So a over b is going to be that golden ratio. 1And let me separate out a little b by b square over here. 1So this has width b as well. 1And so this distance right over here is going to be a minus b. 1So now it is a b by a minus b square. 1Actually, I should say, we have a b by b square, 1right over here. 1This is b by b. 1And then we're left with a b by a minus b rectangle. 1Now wouldn't it be cool if this was also the golden ratio? 1And so let's try it out. 1Let's find the ratio of b to a minus b. 1So the ratio of b to a minus b. 1Well, that's going to be equal to 1 over the ratio of a minus 1b to b. 1I just took the reciprocal of this right over here. 1And this is just going to be equal to 1 over a over b. 1Let me write this, a over b minus 1. 1I just rewrote this right there. 1And that's just going to be equal to 1 over phi. 1The ratio of a to b, we said, by definition was phi minus 1. 1But what is phi minus 1? 1Well phi minus 1 is 1 over phi. 1It's this cool number. 1So it's equal to 1 over 1 over 1 over phi, which is once again, 1just equal to phi. 1So once again, the ratio of this smaller rectangle, 1of its height to its width, is once again 1this golden ratio, this number that keeps showing up. 1And then we could do the same thing again. 1We could separate this into an a minus b by a minus b square. 1Just like that. 1And then we'll have another golden rectangle, 1sometimes it's called, right over there. 1And then we could separate that into a square 1and another golden rectangle. 1Then we could separate that into a square and then 1another golden rectangle. 1Then another golden rectangle. 1Actually let me do it like this. 1This would be better. 1So let me separate. 1Let me do the square up here. 1So this is an a minus b by a minus b square 1and then we have another golden rectangle right over here. 1I could put a square right in there. 1Then we'll have another golden rectangle. 1Then we could put another square right over there, 1you have another golden rectangle. 1I think you see where this is going. 1Another square, another golden rectangle, 1which by itself starts to create a cool design that we can keep 1kind of circling in and in and in. 1And then, if we actually draw an arc here, 1something kind of cool happens. 1If we have an arc that traces these things out, 1we have something, a pattern that you 1might have seen many times before. 1And that pattern does not look too different than what 1you might see in something like a nautilus shell. 1And it shows up all over the place in nature. 1And that makes sense because just the way 1cells construct themselves. 1It kind of makes sense to be the same at different scales 1and the ratio from one scale to the next 1is maybe the same as the constituent ratios. 1This right here, and it shows up all 1over a lot of Leonardo DaVinci's paintings. 1He never explicitly stated it, but there's 1a lot of interesting ratios in them. 1But Salvador Dali, this painting right here, The Sacrament 1of the Last Supper, he explicitly 1used the golden ratio. 1So the actual ratio of the width to the height 1is the golden ratio, so this is a golden rectangle. 1And also there's all sorts of ratios 1and I'll invite you to explore it. 1The ratio of the different parts of the tables 1to where it sits in the painting. 1The golden ratio shows up a ton in this painting. 1And then he does have the pentagons over here. 1And we know that the ratio of the diagonal of the pentagon 1to the sides of the pentagon are also the golden ratio. 1And so he just thought it was a really cool thing. 1There's all sorts of neat things. 1That if you find where these two guys are bowing down are, 1if you draw that line right over here, this is the golden ratio. 1The ratio of this length right over here 1to that length over there. 1Once again, the golden ratio. 1It just keeps showing up in this painting. 1So it's a really, really, really cool thing 1and I really encourage you to explore this 1further because it's kind of exciting.",math_geometry-home_geometry-lines
" Your car gets 25 miles per gallon, and you want to go on a 400-mile road trip. Right now, gas costs $3 per gallon. How much will the gas for your road trip cost? So let's see. They tell us they're going on a 400-mile road trip. 400 miles. So the first thing that I'd want to think about is, well, how many gallons am I using? And then once I know how many gallons I'm using, I know it's $3 per gallon, so I can multiply the number of gallons by $3. So to figure out the number of gallons, would I want to multiply 400 miles-- would I want to multiply that times the miles per gallon, which is 25, or would I want to multiply by the gallons per mile? Well, if I multiply by the gallons per mile, and I multiply that times 400, then I would get the number of gallons. So let's just think about that. I want to multiply that times-- and I'll write the units first-- the gallons per mile. And what are the gallons per mile? Well, we have 25 miles per gallon. We have 25 miles for every 1 gallon. Or you could say we have 1 gallon for every 25 miles. So I really just took the reciprocal of 25 miles per gallon and made it 1/25 gallons per mile. Now what do we get when we multiply these two things? The whole purpose was to figure out how many gallons we're going to use. Well, we see that our miles cancel out. Miles cancel out with miles. And then I have 400 times 1/25 gallons, which is the same thing as 400 divided by 25 gallons. So this is equal to 400/25 gallons, which is the same thing as 400 divided by 25 is equal to 16 gallons. Now it's always important to do a reality check here, not just to try to blindly cancel out units. Does this actually makes sense that 16 is a much lower number than 400? Well, sure it does. And actually, if you have any experience filling up a car, you would sense that, OK, well, that's about the size. On around 16 gallons, a car tends to go 300 or 400 miles if it gets pretty good fuel mileage. So that just makes sense from experience. And it also make sense based on how it's stated. You get 25 miles per gallon. So you're going to need fewer gallons than you're going to need miles. So this all seems to make sense so far. But we haven't answered their question. They want to know, how much will my trip cost? Right now, we've just figured out how much fuel we're going to use. So then we could take our 16 gallons. And to figure out the dollar cost, are we going to multiply it by dollars per gallon or gallons per dollar? Well, if we're thinking just about unit conversion, we want to multiply times the dollars per gallon. So I could write it like this. I could write it like dollars per gallon. Actually, let me just write out the word ""dollar."" Dollars per gallon. The units will cancel out. And it also makes sense. Whatever number of dollars per gallon, I multiply it times the number of gallons, and that's going to tell me how much it's going to cost. This happens at the fuel pump every day. Hey, it's $3 per gallon. I'm going to fill up 16 gallons. Hey, 3 times 16. So let's do that. So it's $3 per gallon. We see the gallons cancel out. And we are left with 16 times $3, which is the same thing as $48. And we are done.",math_algebra_working-units
" The relative frequency table below shows statistics from a study about the relationship between the amount of time a person spends using a computer before bed and the amount that a person sleeps each night. For computer use, each participant was classified as minimal, moderate, or extreme. Let's look at the frequency table below. Let's see. That's the frequency table, and let's see, there's 3 categories of computer time, just like they told us, minimal, moderate, and extreme. This is before they go to bed or at night. Then they have the 3 categories of how much they're sleeping, 5 or a few hours per night, 5 to 7 hours per night, or 7 or more hours. OK, so that's fair enough. Let's see what they want us to do. They tell us, ""Suppose there were 17 people in the study ""who are both in moderate computer users ""and got 5 to 7 hours of sleep."" Moderate, 5 to 7. This category right over here, there are 17 people in this category over here. Just to mark that, let me ... I copy and pasted this chart onto my scratch pad so I can write on it. This group, they're telling us this group, and my pen is really acting up. I don't understand what's going on. This group right over here, there are 17 people. That group right over there is 17 people. Now what are they asking us? They're saying, ""How many people in the study ""were both extreme computer users ""and got 5 to 7 hours of sleep? ""Round to the nearest whole number."" So extreme and got 5 to 7. I'll get my scratch pad out. They are saying how many people are in this bucket, in this bucket right over here? I think I have to replace my pen tablet or something. I don't know why it's getting all splotchy like this. How would we think about this? There are 17 people in this group. How many people are in this group? They tell us that 17 is 34% of the row, of the row total, so I guess you could say 17 is 34.3% of the moderate computer users, or you could say that 17 is 30% of the people who slept 5 to 7 hours each night, or you could say 17 is 10%, is 10% of the total number of people. Let's just go with that. We could figure out the total number of people. So 10%, actually, let me write it this way. So 10% of the total, 10% of total is going to be equal to 17, or that the total, just divide both sides by 10% is equal to 17 divided by 10%, which is the same thing as 17 over 0.1, which, of course, is equal to 170. The total is 170, and they tell us that extreme, extreme computer users represent ... extreme computer users who sleep 5 to 7 hours per night represent 11.7%, 11.7% of the total. So the answer to their question of how many people were extreme computer users who sleep 5 to 7 hours per night, it's 11.7% of 170. Let's go back over here. We actually have a little calculator tool here. It's 11.7%, which is 0.117, times 170, times 170 is, and let me make sure that you can see what I'm doing by scrolling over a little bit, times 170 is equal to 19.89. If we're rounding to the nearest whole, that's going to be 20 people, 20 people. And then they are going to ask us some questions. They say, ""Does the table show evidence ""of an association between being a minimal computer user ""and getting 7 hours of sleep or more?"" Let's just look at the chart. An association between being a minimal computer user and getting 7 hours of sleep or more. It looks like minimal computer users, these are the minimal computer users who get 7 or more hours of sleep. There's a couple of ways to read this. You could say that 51% of minimal computer users get 7 or more hours of sleep. You could say that of the people who get 7 or more hours of sleep, 55% are minimal computer users. And of course, this one just says that minimal computer users who get 7 or more hours of sleep represent 18.3% of all of the people who were surveyed. Let's look at the choices. Actually, before I even look at the choices, let's see if there is an association. It does look like if you look at, if you look at minimal computer users, it looks like a small percentage, only 16% get 5 or few hours. A higher percentage gets 5 to 7 hours, and 51%, the highest percentage, gets 7 or more. So it looks like for minimal computer users, it looks like the distribution is definitely weighted towards getting more sleep. For example, if we look at the extreme computer users, it's the opposite trend. It's 47% have 5 or few hours per night, 33% 5 to 7 hours, and then only 19% get 7 or more. It looks like the moderate is someplace in between. Just looking at this, just looking at each of these rows, it looks like there is a trend where if you use a computer for less time, you are more likely to have more sleep, and likewise, if you use a computer more, you're more likely to have less sleep. Another way to think about it, when you look at the people who are getting 7 or more hours of sleep, a majority of them, a majority of them are minimal computer users, and there's 3 categories. So for 55% to be minimal computer users really does feel like the minimal computer users are more ... they're definitely more disproportionately representing the people who are getting 7 ... or disproportionally represented in this category of 7 or more hours of sleep. You see that the extreme computer users in this category, they represent only 20% of this category. So it does look like there is an association between minimal computer use and getting 7 or more hours of sleep. But let's look at the actual choices they give us. Does the table show evidence of association between a minimal computer user and getting 7 hours of sleep or more? Yes, because 35.1% are extreme computer users, and 29.1% of people are moderate. I go with the yes, but this doesn't seem to really back up the claim. This is just giving us some random data about the percentage that are extreme computer users or moderate computer users. No ... well ... I explained why I go with yes, that there does seem to be a trend, and I don't even believe what this statement is because the total column percentages are essentially equal. We see that the total column ... that the column percentages, the column percentages are not equal for the various, for people who are getting 7 hours or more of sleep. We see that right over here, 55, 25, 20, so I won't go with that one either. Yes, because 51% of minimal computer users get 7 or more hours of sleep, and only 33% of all computer users get 7 or more hours. Yeah. I mean that seems pretty good. 51% of minimal computer users get 7 or more hours of sleep, and only 33% of all computer users get 7 or more hours of sleep. That looks like a pretty good explanation, so I'll check that, but let's just review all of them. No. Well, I already said I think it's yes, but because the total percentage of extreme users who get 5 to 7 hours of sleep is the same as the total percentage of moderate computer users who get 5 to 7 hours of sleep. So that doesn't really meet, it's not touching on the point that we're looking for. Yes, because 55% of people who get 75 ... who get 7 or more hours are minimal computer users, and only 35% of all people are minimal computer users. Actually, I'll go with this as well. Oh yeah, this is a multi-select here, so I could select that one as well. This one, we're looking at of the ... so here, we looked at the percentage of minimal computer users who get 7 hours of sleep, and we saw that percentage is higher than for the whole population. Here, we're looking at the people who get 7 or more hours of sleep, and we're saying 55% of them, 55% of them are minimal computer users even though only 35% of all the people are minimal computer users. So I would go with both of these. And so let us check our answer, and we got it right.",math_engageny-alg-1_alg1-2
" A local hospital recently conducted a blood drive where they collected a total of 80 pints of blood from donors. The hospital was hoping to collect a total of 8 gallons of blood from the drive. Did they meet their goal? How much more or less than their goal did the hospital collect? So really, they collected 80 pints. We just need to figure out how many gallons that is, and then say, well, is that going to be more or less than 8 gallons? So we start with 80 pints. And we can take it step by step. You may or may not know how many pints there are per gallon, so let's just go straight to quarts first, and then from quarts we can go to gallons. But if you know right from the get go how many pints there are per gallon, you could go there. So let's convert this to quarts. So we have 80 pints, so what are we going to multiply or divide by to get quarts? Well, one way to think about it, you're going from a smaller unit, pints, to a larger unit, so you're going to have less of that larger unit. So you're going to divide. This number's going to be smaller when it goes into quarts. And it's going to be smaller by a factor of 2 because you have 2 pints per quart. You're not going to multiply by 2. You're not going to have more quarts. You're going to divide by 2. So you could say, times 1/2. This is the same thing as dividing by 2, and we'll make sure that the units work out. We have one quart for every 2 pints, or you can view this as 2 pints per quart or 1/2 of a quart per pint. Either way, the units work out, and you're essentially taking 80 and dividing by 2, or multiplying by 1/2, and you get 40 quarts. And I want to make sure that your brain does it both ways. Because when you're just doing it, you don't have paper, you don't have the units around, you should just think, hey, 80 pints, there's 2 pints per quart. I'm going to have half as many quarts. I'm going to have 40 quarts. But when problems get a little bit more complicated, it is nice to make sure that the units cancel out in this way, so that you know, OK, 1 quart is 2 pints. Pints in the denominator, pints in the numerator, cancel them out, and I'm just left with quarts, and 80 times 1/2, which is 40. So we have 40 quarts now, and now we can convert this to gallons. We know that there are 4 quarts per gallon or that 1 gallon has 4 quarts. And once again, we're going to go from a smaller unit to a larger unit, to gallons. So we know there's a factor of 4 difference. Since you're going to a larger unit, your brain should say, hey, I'm going to divide by 4. I'm going to have a factor 4 fewer gallons because it's a larger unit. And to make sure that units work out, you just remember, well, we have quarts up here in the numerator, you're going to want quarts down here in the denominator. And we care about converting into gallons, and 1 gallon is 4 quarts. And this will work out. The quarts will cancel out. And notice, you're also dividing by 4. 40 times 1/4 is the exact same thing as 40 divided by 4, which makes sense. We're going to a larger unit. So 40 times 1/4 is 10, and the units left are gallons. So the 80 pints of blood that the hospital collected is 10 gallons. Their goal was only 8 gallons. So did they meet their goal? Yes, they met their goal! How much more or less than their goal did the hospital collect? Well, their goal was 8, they collected 10. They collected 2 extra gallons than their goal.",math_5th-engage-ny_engage-5th-module-2
" One of you all sent a fairly interesting problem, so I thought I would work it out. The problem is I have a group of 30 people, so 30 people in a room. They're randomly selected 30 people. And the question is what is the probability that at least 2 people have the same birthday? This is kind of a fun question because that's the size of a lot of classrooms. What's the probability that at least someone in the classroom shares a birthday with someone else in the classroom? That's a good way to phrase as well. This is the same thing as saying, what is the probability that someone shares with at least someone else. They could share it with 2 other people or 4 other people in the birthday. And at first this problem seems really hard because there's a lot of circumstances that makes this true. I could have exactly 2 people have the same birthday. I could have exactly 3 people have the same birthday. I could have exactly 29 people have the same birthday and all of these make this true, so do I add the probability of each of those circumstances? And then add them up and then that becomes really hard. And then I would have to say, OK, whose birthdays and I comparing? And I would have to do combinations. It becomes a really difficult problem unless you make kind of one very simplifying take on the problem. This is the opposite of-- well let me draw the probability space. Let's say that this is all of the outcomes. Let me draw it with a thicker line. So let's say that's all of the outcomes of my probability space. So that's 100% of the outcomes. We want to know-- let me draw it in a color that won't be offensive to you. That doesn't look that great, but anyway. Let's say that this is the probability, this area right here-- and I don't know how big it really is, we'll figure it out. Let's say that this is the probability that someone shares a birthday with at least someone else. What's this area over here? What's this green area? Well, that means if these are all the cases where someone shares a birthday with someone else, these are all the area where no one shares a birthday with anyone. Or you could say, all 30 people have different birthdays. This is what we're trying to figure out. I'll just call it the probability that someone shares. I'll call it the probability of sharing, probability of s. If this whole area is area 1 or area 100%, this green area right here, this is going to be 1 minus p of s. This is going to be 1 minus p of s. Or if we said that this is the probability-- or another way we could say it, actually this is the best way to think about it. If this is different, so this is the probability of different birthdays. This is the probability that all 30 people have 30 different birthdays. No one shares with anyone. The probability that someone shares with someone else plus the probability that no one shares with anyone-- they all have distinct birthdays-- that's got to be equal to 1. Because we're either going to be in this situation or we're going to be in that situation. Or you can say they're equal to 100%. Either way, 100% and 1 are the same number. It's equal to 100%. So if we figure out the probability that everyone has the same birthday we could subtract it from 100. So let's see. We could we just rewrite this. The probability that someone shares a birthday with someone else, that's equal to 100% minus the probability that everyone has distinct, separate birthdays. And the reason why I'm doing that is because as I started off in the video, this is kind of hard to figure out. You know, I can figure out the probability that 2 people have the same birthday, 5 people, and it becomes very confusing. But here, if I wanted to just figure out the probability that everyone has a distinct birthday, it's actually a much easier probability to solve for. So what's the probability that everyone has a distinct birthday? So let's think about it. Person one. Just for simplicity, let's imagine the case that we only have 2 people in the room. What's the probably that they have different birthdays? Let's see, person one, their birthday could be 365 days out of 365 days of the year. You know, whenever their birthday is. And then person two, if we wanted to ensure that they don't have the same birthday, how many days could person two be born on? Well, it could be born on any day that person one was not born on. So there are 364 possibilities out 365. So if you had 2 people, the probability that no one is born on the same birthday-- this is just 1. It's just going to be equal to 364/365. Now what happens if we had 3 people? So first of all the first person could be born on any day. Then the second person could be born on 364 possible days out of 365. And then the third person, what's the probability that the third person isn't born on either of these people birthdays? So 2 days are taken up, so the probability is 363/365. You multiply them out. You get 365 times 36-- actually I should rewrite this one. Instead of saying this is 1, let me write this as-- the numerator is 365 times 364 over 365 squared. Because I want you to see the pattern. Here the probability is 365 times 364 times 363 over 365 to the third power. And so, in general, if you just kept doing this to 30, if I just kept this process for 30 people-- the probability that no one shares the same birthday would be equal to 365 times 364 times 363-- I'll have 30 terms up here. All the way down to what? All the way down to 336. That'll actually be 30 terms divided by 365 to the 30th power. And you can just type this into your calculator right now. It'll take you a little time to type in 30 numbers, and you'll get the probability that no one shares the same birthday with anyone else. But before we do that let me just show you something that might make it a little bit easier. Is there any way that I can mathematically express this with factorials? Or that I could mathematically express this with factorials? Let's think about it. 365 factorial is what? 365 factorial is equal to 365 times 364 times 363 times-- all the way down to 1. You just keep multiplying. It's a huge number. Now, if I just want the 365 times the 364 in this case, I have to get rid of all of these numbers back here. One thing I could do is I could divide this thing by all of these numbers. So 363 times 362-- all the way down to 1. So that's the same thing as dividing by 363 factorial. 365 factorial divided by 363 factorial is essentially this because all of these terms cancel out. So this is equal to 365 factorial over 363 factorial over 365 squared. And of course, for this case, it's almost silly to worry about the factorials, but it becomes useful once we have something larger than two terms up here. So by the same logic, this right here is going to be equal to 365 factorial over 362 factorial over 365 squared. And actually, just another interesting point. How did we get this 365? Sorry, how did we get this 363 factorial? Well, 365 minus 2 is 363, right? And that makes sense because we only wanted two terms up here. We only wanted two terms right here. So we wanted to divide by a factorial that's two less. And so we'd only get the highest two terms left. This is also equal to-- you could write this as 365 factorial divided by 365 minus 2 factorial 365 minus 2 is 363 factorial and then you just end up with those two terms and that's that there. And then likewise, this right here, this numerator you could rewrite as 365 factorial divided by 365 minus 3-- and we had 3 people-- factorial. And that should hopefully make sense, right? This is the same thing as 365 factorial-- well 365 divided 1by 3 is 362 factorial. 1And so that's equal to 365 times 364 times 1363 all the way down. 1Divided by 362 times all the way down. 1And that'll cancel out with everything else and you'd 1be just left with that. 1And that's that right there. 1So by that same logic, this top part here can be written as 1365 factorial over what? 1365 minus 30 factorial. 1And I did all of that just so I could show you kind of the 1pattern and because this is frankly easier to type into a 1calculator if you know where the factorial button is. 1So let's figure out what this entire probability is. 1So turning on the calculator, we want-- so let's 1do the numerator. 1365 factorial divided by-- well, what's 365 minus 30? 1That's 335. 1Divided by 335 factorial and that's the whole numerator. 1And now we want to divide the numerator by 365 1to the 30th power. 1Let the calculator think and we get 0.2936. 1Equals 0.2936. 1Actually 37 if you rounded, which is equal to 29.37%. 1Now, just so you remember what we were doing all along, this 1was the probability that no one shares a birthday with anyone. 1This was the probability of everyone having distinct, 1different birthdays from everyone else. 1And we said, well, the probability that someone shares 1a birthday with someone else, or maybe more than one person, 1is equal to all of the possibilities-- kind of the 1100%, the probability space, minus the probability that no 1one shares a birthday with anybody. 1So that's equal to 100% minus 29.37%. 1Or another way you could write it as that's 1 minus 0.2937, 1which is equal to-- so if I want to subtract that from 1. 11 minus-- that just means the answer. 1That means 1 minus 0.29. 1You get 0.7063. 1So the probability that someone shares a birthday with someone 1else is 0.7063-- it keeps going. 1Which is approximately equal to 70.6%. 1Which is kind of a neat result because if you have 30 people 1in a room you might say, oh wow, what are the odds 1that someone has the same birthday as someone else? 1It's actually pretty high. 170% of the time, if you have a group of 30 people, at least 1 1person shares a birthday with at least one other 1person in the room. 1So that's kind of a neat problem. 1And kind of a neat result at the same time. 1Anyway, see you in the next video.",math_precalculus_prob-comb
" We have a graph right over here, and we have 4 potential function definitions for that graph. What you might want to do is pause the video right now and think about which of these function definitions are actually being depicted in this graph right over here? I'm assuming you've given a go at it. Now let's work through it together. Before we even address these, we all see that they all have a log base 2 in the function definition. Let's just remind ourselves what y equals log base 2 of x even looks like, and then we could think about what happens if we were to add 1 or subtract 1 from it, or if we were to shift it a little bit. Let's just think about some interesting values here. Let's think about some interesting values. Let's think about what happens. We'll have x and y. Let's think about when x is equal to 2. I picked 2 because if x is equal to 2, you're saying log base 2 of 2, what power do I have to raise 2 to to get to 2? We'll have to raise it to the 1st power. What about when x is equal to ... Actually, let me do several of them. Let's do an x is equal to 8. Log base 2 of 8 is 3. I raise 2 to the 3rd power. I get 8. Let's do 4. Log base 2 of 4 is 2. 2 to the 2nd power is equal to 4. Let's do 2, where we started off with. That log base 2 of 2 is going to be 1. 2 to the 1st power is equal to 2. Now let's think about when x is equal to 1. We'd have to raise 2 too to get to 1. Well, I raise it to the 0th power. 2 to the 0th power is equal to 1. Now let's think about how we would get to 1/2. What do I have to raise 2 to to get to 1/2? 2 to the negative 1 power is going to be equal to 1/2, and I can keep going. What about 1/4? That's 2 to the negative 2 power is 1/4. I could go to 1/8. 2 to the negative 3 power is equal to 1/8. Now let's just graph some of these points. When x is equal to 8, y is equal to 3. When x is equal to 4, y is equal to 2. When x is equal to 2, y is equal to 1. When x is equal to 1, y is equal to 0. I think you see the general shape already forming. When x is 1/2, y is negative 1. When x is 1/4, y is negative 2. I think you see where this is going. When x is 1/8, y is negative 3. See, you have a graph that looks something like this. It looks something like this. I'm just connecting the dots. This is the behavior that we would expect. As x becomes really, really, really large, you think about what power do I have to raise 2 to, 2 to to get that x? Well, it's going to increase, but it's going to increase at an ever-decreasing rate. Then we see that as x approaches 0 from the right, to get closer and closer to 0, you have to raise 2 to more and more and more negative values, so the log, as we approach 0, it becomes very, very, very, very, very negative. We could never quite get to x equals 0. If you put an actual 0 right over here, what power would you have to raise 2 to to get to 0? Well, you can't. You could get close to 0 by raising 2 to a very, a very, very, very negative a very, very, very negative value, and this thing right over here is not going to be even defined for negative, for any, for non-positive x's. That's why we have it not defined for anything less than or equal to 0. This domain right over here is only for positive x's. That's log base 2 of x. How is this thing right over here, how does this thing right over here look different? Well, the obvious thing that jumps out at me is that it's flipped over the x-axis, so that's a pretty good sign that this is going ... we're going to have a negative log base 2 of x. Let's actually now graph. Let's graph that. What's y is equal to negative log base 2 of x going to look like? Each of these points, we're just going to flip it over, we're just going to flip it over the x-axis, so we're going to go there. We're going to go there. We're going to go there, and then this, this is going to go through that point right over here, and then let's see, instead of it 1/2, it's going to be like this. y equals negative log base 2 of x is going to look something like this. Let me see if I can draw it neatly. It's going to look something like this, something like this. We're getting close to the blue graph. That's y equals negative log base 2 of x. What's the difference between the green graph and the blue graph? If you look carefully, you see, you see that the blue graph is essentially the green graph shifted to the left by 2, shifted to the left. We've shifted it to the left by 2. At every one of these points, we have shifted to the left by 2. How do you shift to the left by 2? You would replace the x with an x plus 2. You would replace the x with an x plus 2. One way to think about it is in the original negative log base 2 of x, we see this asymptote at x equals 0. Now we're going to see the asymptote when this whole expression, x plus 2 is equal to 0, x plus 2 is equal to 0 when x is equal to negative 2. When x is equal to negative 2, you see the asymptote right over there. I encourage you, you could try values out if you like. You could essentially take all of these values. You could take all of these values and subtract 2 from them, and then when you add 2, you're going to get back to these values. If you shift to the left by 2, that's like replacing the x with an x plus 2. This is what is being graphed. Once again, try out the values if you don't believe me.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-3
" -  So let's say that I am a drug company and I have come up with a medicine that I think will help folks with diabetes, and in particular, I think it will help reduce their hemoglobin A1c levels, and for those of you who aren't familiar with what hemoglobin A1c is, I encourage you, we have a video on that on Khan Academy, but the general idea is if you have high blood sugar over roughly a three-month period of time, high blood sugar, and I can say high average blood sugar, you're going to have a high A1c, a high hemoglobin A1c level and if you have a low average blood sugar over roughly a three-month time, you're going to have a lower hemoglobin A1c. So if taking the pill seems to lower folks' A1c levels more than is likely to happen due to randomly or due to other variables, well then that means that your new pill might be effective at controlling folks' diabetes. So in this situation, when we're constructing an experiment to test this, we would say that whether or not you are taking the pill, this is the explanatory variable. Explanatory variable, and the thing that it is affecting, the thing that you're hoping has some response, in this case the A1c levels are your indicator of whether it is help controlling the blood sugar, we call that the response variable. That right over there is the response variable. So how are we actually going to conduct this experiment? Well let's say that we have a group of folks, let's say that we have been given a group of 100 folks who need to control their diabetes. So 100 people here who need to control their diabetes, and we say, ""Alright, well let's take half of this group ""and put them into, I guess you could say a treatment group ""and another half and put them into a control group ""and see if the treatment group, the one that actually ""gets my pill is going to improve their A1c levels in a way ""that seems like it would not be just random chance."" So let's do that, so we're going to have a control group, so this is my control group, control, and this is the treatment group, this is the treatment group. And you might say, ""Okay, we'll just give these folks, ""the treatment group the pill and then we won't give ""the pill that I created to the control group."" But that might introduce a psychological aspect that maybe the benefit of the pill is just people feeling, ""Hey I'm taking something that'll control my diabetes,"" maybe that psychologically affects their blood sugar in some way and this is actually possible, maybe it makes them act healthier in certain ways, maybe that makes them act unhealthier in certain ways 'cause they're like, ""Oh I have a pill to control ""my diabetes, my blood sugar, I can go eat ""more sweets now and it'll control it."" And so to avoid that, in order for just the very fact that someone says, ""Hey I think I'm taking a medicine, ""I might behave in a different way or it might even ""psychologically affect my body in a certain way,"" what we wanna do is give both groups a pill, and we wanna do it in a way that neither group knows which pill they're getting. So what we would do here is we would give this group a placebo, a placebo, and this group would actually get the medicine, the medicine, but those pills should look the same, and people should not know which group they are in and that is a, when we do that, that is a blind experiment, experiment. Now you might have heard about double-blind experiments. Well that would be the case where not only do people not know which group they're in, but even their physician or the person who's administering the experiment, they don't know which one they're giving, they don't know if they're giving the placebo or the actual medicine to the group. So let's say we wanna do that. So we could do double, double-blind experiment, so even the person giving the pill doesn't know which pill they're giving. And you might say, ""Well why is that important?"" Well if the physician knows, or the person administering or interfacing with the patient, they might give a tell somehow, they might not put as much emphasis on the importance of taking the pill if it's a placebo, they might by accident give away some type of information. So to avoid that type of thing happening, you could do a double-blind, and there's even, some people talk about a triple-blind experiment where even the people analyzing the data don't know which group was the control group and which group was the treatment group, and once again, that's another way to avoid bias. So now that we've kinda figured out, we have a control group, we have a treatment group, we're using A1c as our response variable, so we would wanna measure folks' A1c levels, their hemoglobin A1c levels before they get either the placebo or the medicine and then maybe after three months, we would measure their A1c after, but the next question is, how do you divvy these 100 people up into these two groups, and you might say, ""Well I would wanna do it randomly,"" and you would be right 'cause if you didn't do it randomly, if you put all the men here and all the women here, well that might, first of all, sex might explain it or behavior of men versus women might explain the differences or the non-differences you see in A1c level, if you get a lot of people of one age or one part of the country or one type of dietary habit, you don't want that, so in order to avoid having an imbalance of some of those lurking variables, you would want to randomly sample and we've done multiple videos already on ways to randomly sample, so you're going to randomly sample and put people into either groups. And a very simple way of doing that, you could give everyone here a number from one to 100, use a random number generator to do that and then, or you could use a random number generator, pick 50 names to put in the control group or 50 names to put in the treatment group and then everyone else gets put in the other group. Now, to avoid a situation, just randomly by doing a random sample, you might have a situation where there's some probability that you disproportionately have more men in one group or more women in another group and to avoid that, you could do really a version of stratified sampling that we've talked about in other videos, which is you could do what's called a block design for your random assignment where you actually split everyone into men and women and it might be 50-50 or it might even be just randomly here you got 60 women, 60 women and 40 men and what you do here is you say, ""Okay let's randomly ""take 30 of these women and put 'em in the control group ""and 30 of the women and put 'em in the treatment group ""and let's put randomly 20 of the men in the control group ""and 20 of the men in the treatment group"" and that way someone's sex is less likely to introduce bias into what actually happens here, so once again, doing this is called a block design, really a version of stratified sampling. Block design, and there might be other lurking variables that you wanna make sure doesn't just show up here randomly and so you might want, there's other ways of randomly assigning. Now once you do this, you see what was a change in A1c. If you see that, hey, the change in A1c, one if you see there's no difference in A1c levels between these two groups, and you're like, ""Hey, there's a good probability that my pill does nothing"" and once again it's all about probabilities, there's some chance that you're just unlucky and it might be a very small chance and that's why you wanna do this with a good number of people and as we forward our statistics understandings, we will better understand at what threshold levels do we think the probability is high or low enough for us to really feel good about our findings. But let's say that you do see an improvement, you need to think about, is that improvement, could that have happened due to random chance or is it very unlikely that that happened due purely to random chance, and if it was very unlikely that it happened due purely to random chance, then you would feel pretty good, and other people when you publish the results, would feel pretty good about your medicine. Now, even then, science is not done. No one will say that they are 100% sure that your medicine is good, there still might have been some lurking variables that we did not, that our experiment did not properly adjust for, that just when we even did this block design, we might have disproportionately gotten randomly older people in one of the groups or the other or people from one part of the country in one group or another so there's always things to think about and the most important thing to think about, even if you did this as good as you could, you still, some random chance might have given you a false positive, you got good results even though it was random, or a false negative, you got bad results even though it was actually random. And so a very important idea in experiments and this is in science in general is that this experiment, you should document it well and it should be, the process of replication, other people should 1be able to replicate this experiment 1and hopefully get consistent results 1so it's not just about the results, 1it's your experiment design, other people should, 1it should be an experiment that other people could 1and should replicate to reinforce the idea 1that your results are actually true 1and not just random or just due to some 1bad administration of the actual experiment.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-4
" We are asked to approximate the principal root, or the positive square root of 45, to the hundredths place. And I'm assuming they don't want us to use a calculator. Because that would be too easy. So, let's see if we can approximate this just with our pen and paper right over here. So the square root of 45, or the principal root of 45. 45 is not a perfect square. It's definitely not a perfect square. Let's see, what are the perfect squares around it? We know that it is going to be less than-- the next perfect square above 45 is going to be 49 because that is 7 times 7-- so it's less than the square root of 49 and it's greater than the square root of 36. And so, the square root of 36, the principal root of 36 I should say, is 6. And the principal root of 49 is 7. So, this value right over here is going to be between 6 and 7. And if we look at it, it's only four away from 49. And it's nine away from 36. So, the different between 36 and 49 is 13. So, it's a total 13 gap between the 6 squared and 7 squared. And this is nine of the way through it. So, just as a kind of approximation maybe-- and it's not going to work out perfectly because we're squaring it, this isn't a linear relationship-- but it's going to be closer to 7 than it's going to be to 6. At least the 45 is 9/13 of the way. Let's see. It looks like that's about 2/3 of the way. So, let's try 6.7 as a guess just based on 0.7 is about 2/3. It looks like about the same. Actually, we could calculate this right here if we want. Actually, let's do that just for fun. So 9/13 as a decimal is going to be what? It's going to be 13 into 9. We're going to put some decimal places right over here. 13 doesn't go into 9 but 13 does go into 90. And it goes into 90-- let's see, does it go into it seven times-- it goes into it six times. So, 6 times 3 is 18. 6 times 1 is 6, plus 1 is 7. And then you subtract, you get 12. So, went into it almost exactly seven times. So, this value right here is almost a 0.7. And so if you say, how many times does 13 go into 120? It looks like it's like nine times? Yeah, it would go into it nine times. 9 times 3. Get rid of this. 9 times 3 is 27. 9 times 1 is 9, plus 2 is 11. You have a remainder of 3. It's about 0.69. So 6.7 would be a pretty good guess. This is 0.69 of the way between 36 and 49. So, let's go roughly 0.69 of the way between 6 and 7. So this is once again just to approximate. It's not necessarily going to give us the exact answer. We have to use that to make a good initial guess. And then see how it works. Let's try 6.7. And the really way to try it is to square 6.7. So 6.7 times-- maybe I'll write the multiplication symbol there-- 6.7 times 6.7. So, we have 7 times 7 is 49. 7 times 6 is 42, plus 4 is 46. Put a 0 now because we've moved a space to the left. So, now we have 6 times 7 is 42. Carry the 4. 6 times 6 is 36, plus 4 is 40. And so, 9 plus 0 is 9. 6 plus 2 is 8. 4 plus 0 is 4. And then we have a 4 right over here. And we have two total numbers behind the decimal point. One, two. So this gives us 44.89. So, 6.7 gets us pretty close. But we're still not probably right to the hundredth. Well, we're definitely not to the hundredths place. This since we've only gone to the tenths place right over here. So, if we want to get to 45, 6.7 squared is still less than 45, or 6.7 is still less than the square root of 45. So let's try 6.71. Let me do this in a new color. I'll do 6.71 in pink. So, let's try 6.71. Increase it a little bit. See if we go from 44.89 to 45. Because this is really close already. Let's just try it out. 6.71. So once again, we have to do some arithmetic by hand. We are assuming that they don't want us to use a calculator here. So, we have 1 times 1 is 1. 1 times 7 is 7. 1 times 6 is 6. Put a 0 here. 7 times 1 is 7. 7 times 7 is 49. 7 times 6 is 42, plus 4 is 46. And then we have two 0s here. 6 times 1 is 6. 6 times 7 is 42. Just have this new 4 here. 6 times 6 is 36, plus 4 is 40. Plus 40. It's interesting to think what we got incrementally by adding that one hundredth over there. Well, we'll see actually when we add all of this up. You get a 1. 7 plus 7 is 14. 1 plus 6 plus 9 is 16, plus 6 is 22. 2 plus 6 plus 2 is 10. And then 1 plus 4 is 5. And then we bring down the 4. And we have one, two, three, four numbers behind the decimal point. One, two, three, four. So, when you we squared 6.71. 6.71 squared is equal to 45.0241. So 6.71 is a little bit greater. So, let me make it clear now. We know that 6.7 is less than the square root of 45. And we know that is less than 6.71. Because when we square this, we get something a little bit over the square root of 45. But the key here is when we square this, so 6.7 squared got us 44.89 which is 0.11 away from 45. And then, if we look at 6.71 squared, we're only 2.4 hundredths above 45. So, this right here is closer to the square root of 45. So if we approximate to the hundredths place, definitely want to go with 6.71.",math_8th-grade-illustrative-math_unit-8-pythagorean-theorem-and-irrational-numbers
" Let's solve a few more systems of equations using elimination, but in these it won't be kind of a one-step elimination. We're going to have to massage the equations a little bit in order to prepare them for elimination. So let's say that we have an equation, 5x minus 10y is equal to 15. And we have another equation, 3x minus 2y is equal to 3. And I said we want to do this using elimination. Once again, we could use substitution, we could graph both of these lines and figure out where they intersect. But we're going to use elimination. But the first thing you might say, hey, Sal, you know, with elimination, you were subtracting the left-hand side of one equation from another, or adding the two, and then adding the two right-hand sides. And I could do that, because it was essentially adding the same thing to both sides of the equation. But here, it's not obvious that that would be of any help. If we added these two left-hand sides, you would get 8x minus 12y. That wouldn't eliminate any variables. And on the right-hand side, you would just be left with a number. And if you subtracted, that wouldn't eliminate any variables. So how is elimination going to help here? And the answer is, we can multiply both of these equations in such a way that maybe we can get one of these terms to cancel out with one of the others. And you could really pick which term you want to cancel out. Let's say we want to cancel out the y terms. So I'll just rewrite this 5x minus 10y here. 5x minus 10y is equal to 15. Now, is there anything that I can multiply this green equation by so that this negative 2y term becomes a term that will cancel out with the negative 10y? So I essentially want to make this negative 2y into a positive 10y. Right? Because if this is a positive 10y, it'll cancel out when I add the left-hand sides of this equation. So what can I multiply this equation by? Well, if I multiply it by negative 5, negative 5 times negative 2 right here would be positive 10. So let's do that. Let's multiply this equation times negative 5. So you multiply the left-hand side by negative 5, and multiply the right-hand side by negative 5. And what do you get? Remember, we're not fundamentally changing the equation. We're not changing the information in the equation. We're doing the same thing to both sides of it. So the left-hand side of the equation becomes negative 5 times 3x is negative 15x. And then negative 5 times negative 2y is plus 10y, is equal to 3 times negative 5 is negative 15. And now, we're ready to do our elimination. If we add this to the left-hand side of the yellow equation, and we add the negative 15 to the right-hand side of the yellow equation, we are adding the same thing to both sides of the equation. Because this is equal to that. So let's do that. So 5x minus 15y-- we have this little negative sign there, we don't want to lose that-- that's negative 10x. The y's cancel out. Negative 10y plus 10y, that's 0y. That was the whole point behind multiplying this by negative 5. Is going to be equal to-- 15 minus 15 is 0. So negative 10x is equal to 0. Divide both sides by negative 10, and you get x is equal to 0. And now we can substitute back into either of these equations to figure out what y must be equal to. Let's substitute into the top equation. So we get 5 times 0, minus 10y, is equal to 15. Or negative 10y is equal to 15. Let me write that. Negative 10y is equal to 15. Divide both sides by negative 10. And we are left with y is equal to 15/10, is negative 3/2. So if you were to graph it, the point of intersection would be the point 0, negative 3/2. And you can verify that it also satisfies this equation. The original equation over here was 3x minus 2y is equal to 3. 3 times 0, which is 0, minus 2 times negative 3/2 is, this is 0, this is positive 3. Right? These cancel out, these become positive. Plus positive 3 is equal to 3. So this does indeed satisfy both equations. Let's do another one of these where we have to multiply, and to massage the equations, and then we can eliminate one of the variables. Let's do another one. Let's say we have 5x plus 7y is equal to 15. And we have 7-- let me do another color-- 7x minus 3y is equal to 5. Now once again, if you just added or subtracted both the left-hand sides, you're not going to eliminate any variables. These aren't in any way kind of have the same coefficient or the negative of their coefficient. So let's pick a variable to eliminate. Let's say we want to eliminate the x's this time. And you could literally pick on one of the variables or another. It doesn't matter. You can say let's eliminate the y's first. But I'm going to choose to eliminate the x's first. And so what I need to do is massage one or both of these equations in a way that these guys have the same coefficients, or their coefficients are the negatives of each other, so that when I add the left-hand sides, they're going to eliminate each other. Now, there's nothing obvious-- I can multiply this by a fraction to make it equal to negative 5. Or I can multiply this by a fraction to make it equal to negative 7. But even a more fun thing to do is I can try to get both of them to be their least common multiple. I could get both of these to 35. And the way I can do it is by multiplying by each other. So I can multiply this top equation by 7. And I'm picking 7 so that this becomes a 35. And I can multiply this bottom equation by negative 5. And the reason why I'm doing that is so this becomes a negative 35. Remember, my point is I want to eliminate the x's. So if I make this a 35, and if I make this a negative 35, then I'm going to be all set. I can add the left-hand and the right-hand sides of the equations. So this top equation, when you multiply it by 7, it becomes-- let me scroll up a little bit-- we multiply it by 7, it becomes 35x plus 49y is equal to-- let's see, this is 70 plus 35 is equal to 105. Right? 15 and 70, plus 35, is equal to 105. That's what the top equation becomes. This bottom equation becomes negative 5 times 7x, is negative 35x, negative 5 times negative 3y is plus 15y. The negatives cancel out. And then 5-- this isn't a minus 5-- this is times negative 5. 5 times negative 5 is equal to negative 25. Now, we can start with this top equation and add the same thing to both sides, where that same thing is negative 25, which is also equal to this expression. So let's add the left-hand sides and the right-hand sides. Because we're really adding the same thing to both sides of the equation. So the left-hand side, the x's cancel out. 35x minus 35x. That was the whole point. They cancel out, and on the y's, you get 49y plus 15y, that is 64y. 64y is equal to 105 minus 25 is equal to 80. Divide both sides by 64, and you get y is equal to 80/64. And let's see, if you divide the numerator and the denominator by 8-- actually you could probably do 16. 16 would be better. But let's do 8 first, just because we know our 8 times tables. So that becomes 10/8, and then you can divide this by 2, and you get 5/4. If you divided just straight up by 16, you would've gone straight to 5/4. So y is equal to 5/4. Let's figure out what x is. So we can substitute either into one of these equations, or into one of the original equations. Let's substitute into the second of the original equations, where we had 7x minus 3y is equal to 5. That was the original version of the second equation that we later transformed into this. So we get 7x minus 3 times y, times 5/4, is equal to 5. Or 7x minus 15/4 is equal to 5. Let's add 15/4-- Oh, sorry, I didn't do that right. This would be 7x minus 3 times 4-- Oh, sorry, that was right. 1What am I doing? 13 times is 15/4. 1Is equal to 5. 1Let's add 15/4 to both sides. 1And what do we get? 1The left-hand side just becomes a 7x. 1These guys cancel out. 1And that's going to be equal to 5, is the 1same thing as 20/4. 120/4 plus 15/4. 1Or we get that-- let me scroll down a little bit-- 7x is 1equal to 35/4. 1We can multiply both sides by 1/7, or we could divide both 1sides by 7, same thing. 1Let's multiply both sides by 1/7. 1The same thing as dividing by 7. 1So these cancel out and you're left with x is equal to-- 1Here, if you divide 35 by 7, you get 5. 1You divide 7 by 7, you get 1. 1So x is equal to 5/4 as well. 1So the point of intersection of this right here is both x 1and y are going to be equal to 5/4. 1So if you looked at it as a graph, it'd be 5/4 comma 5/4. 1And let's verify that this satisfies the top equation. 1And if you take 5 times 5/4, plus 7 times 15/4, what do you get? 1It should be equal to 15. 1So this is equal to 25/4, plus-- what is this? 1This is plus 35/4. 1Which is equal to 60/4, which is indeed equal to 15. 1So it does definitely satisfy that top equation. 1And you could check out this bottom equation for yourself, 1but it should, because we actually used this bottom 1equation to figure out that x is equal to 5/4.",math_math1_systems
" -  Consider the table with function values for f of x is equal to x squared over one minus cosine x at positive x-values near zero. Notice that there is one missing value in the table. This is the missing one right here. Use a calculator to evaluate f of x at x equals 0.1 and enter this number in the table rounded to the nearest thousandth. From the table, what does the one-sided limit, the limit as x approaches zero from the positive direction of x squared over one minus cosine of x appear to be? So let's see what they did. They evaluated when x equals one, f of x equals 2.175. When x gets even a little bit closer to zero, and once again, we're approaching zero from values larger than zero. That's what this little superscript positive tell us. We're at 0.5, and we're at 2.042. Then when we get even closer to zero, 0.2, f of x is 2.007. And so I'm guessing when I'm getting even closer, it's gonna be even closer to two right over here. But let's verify that. Get my calculator out. So I wanna evaluate x squared over one minus cosine of x when x is equal to 0.1. So the first thing I wanna actually, let me verify that I'm in radian mode 'cause otherwise I might get a strange answer. So I am in radian mode. And so let me evaluate it. So I'm going to have 0.1 squared over, let me do divide it by one minus cosine of 0.1. And this gets me 2.0016. And let's see, they want us to round to the nearest thousandth. So that'll be 2.002. Type that in. 2.002. And so it looks like the limit is approaching two. It's not approaching 2.005. We just crossed 2.005 from 2.007 to 2.002. So let's check our answer. And we got it right. And I always find it fun to visualize these things, and that's what a graphing calculator is good for. It can actually graph things. So let's graph this right over here. So go into graph mode. Let me redefine my function here. So let's see. It's going to be x squared divided by one minus cosine of x. And then let me make sure that the range of my graph is right, so I'm zoomed in at the right part that I care about. So let me go to the range. And let's see. I care about approaching zero from the positive direction, but as long as I see values around zero, I should be fine. But I could actually zoom in a little bit more, so I can make them my minimum x-value. I don't know, let me make it negative one. Let me make my maximum x-value. The maximum x-value here is one, but just to get some space here I'll make this 1.5. So the x-scale is one. Y-minimum, it seems like we're approaching two. So the y-max can be much smaller, let's see. We'll make y-max three. And now let's graph this thing. So let's see what it's doing. It looks like... And you see here whether, and actually it looks like whether you're approaching from the positive direction or from the negative direction, it looks like you're approaching, the value of the function approaches two. But this problem, we're only caring about as we have x-values that approaching zero from values larger than zero. So this is the limit. This is the one-sided limit that we care about with the two shows up right over here as well.",math_in-in-grade-11-ncert_in-in-class11-limits
" -  Betty's Bakery calculates the total price D in dollars for C cupcakes using the equation D is equal to two times C. What does two mean in this situation? So pause this video and see if you can answer that. Alright, before I even look at the choices, let me just interpret this. This says D equals 2C tells us that however many cupcakes someone buys, we multiply that times two to get the amount of dollars, the price that they need to pay. So this must mean that each cupcake is two dollars. Or that it's two dollars per cupcake. Because however many cupcakes we get, we multiply that by two dollars per cupcake to get the actual price. So let's see, choice A says the bakery charges two dollars for each cupcake. Yeah, that's pretty close to what I just said. So I'll go with that one. The bakery sells two cupcakes for a dollar. No, that would not be the case. And you could even try it out. If we had one cupcake. So if C is one, what is D going to be? And actually, let me just do that for you 'cause it's interesting. C and D. So if you get one cupcake, you're gonna multiply it by two. It's going to be two dollars. Two cupcakes, we're gonna multiply it by two and be four dollars. It's consistent with this first choice, but to sell two cupcakes, it's not gonna be four dollars, it's gonna be for four dollars. The bakery sells two types of cupcakes. Well, they don't say anything about that, so I'll rule that out, as well. Let's do another one. Here, we are told, select the store with the least expensive ice cream per scoop. There's definitely a dessert theme going on over here. Alright, so pause this video and see if you can work it out. Is it choice A, choice B or choice C. Alright, now let's go through these together. Choice A calculates the total price D in dollars of ice cream with S scoops using the equation D is equal to 0.75S. So whatever the number of scoops are, we're gonna multiply that times 75 cents or 75 hundredth of a dollar to get the price. And so based on the logic we just used in that last example, in store A, it is 75 cents, 75 cents per, per scoop. So we know the price there. And anything like this, when you're comparing, you wanna put it all in the same terms. Okay, here it's 75 cents per scoop. Let's think about how many, how much per scoop it is at B. And how many, how much per scoop it is for C. Alright, now store B. So, when I get three scoops, I multiply that times one to get three dollars. When I get eight scoops, I multiply it times one to get eight dollars. When I have 12 scoops, I multiply it by one to get 12 dollars. So the equation that store B must use is that the dollar is D. That's going to be equal to one times the number of scoops. Or you could view this as, hey, it's a dollar per scoop at store B. So one dollar, one dollar per scoop. So we already know that store A is cheaper than store B. 'Cause 75 cents per scoop is cheaper than one dollar per scoop. Store C, alright, so here this, this relationship is described with a graph but we can put it in the same forms that we saw before. So for store C. Make a little table here. And so if I have the scoops and I have the dollars. So let's see. When I get two scoops, it looks like, and I'm just picking values where it looks like I can read the graph easily. Two scoops looks like three dollars. Two scoops, three dollars. Four scoops, it is six dollars. Four scoops, it's six dollars. So it looks like I'm multiplying times one point half, one and a half, I was gonna say one point half. 1.5 or one and a half to go from scoops to dollars. Or another way you can think about it is the dollars is equal to 1.5 times the scoops. Or another way to think about it, at store C, they're charging a 1.50, 1.50 per, per scoop. So store C is the most expensive followed by B and then store A is the cheapest and that's what they're asking us. The least expensive ice cream per scoop is store A.",math_7th-grade-illustrative-math_unit-2-introducing-proportional-relationships
" As someone who's married to a doctor, in the medical field, I think it's pretty important to have a precise understanding of what the words mean, just so that you can understand what people are talking about if either you are a health care professional or if some health care professional is talking to you, as my wife does when, well, sometimes does, when she comes home from work. So let's get a little bit more precise with some of the words we've been talking about, especially relative to heart disease and heart failure and all of the rest. So let's say this is an artery. The blood is flowing in that direction. I'll show the artery branching off. It thins as it goes farther and farther along. So this right here is an artery. And let me draw a plaque in that artery. And we've been studying these plaques in arteries since the video on heart attacks. So let's say that this is a bunch of white blood cells and lipid material. So it's cholesterol and fats and all the rest. Now a word that you might hear in kind of a medical context is stenosis. And the word ""stenosis"" just refers to the narrowing, usually of a blood vessel. So this right here, this blood vessel has been narrowed. So this right over here is stenosis. It's been narrowed by this plaque. It can also refer to the narrowing of kind of any type of tubular structure. So if you have any type of kind of pipe in a biological system and it gets narrow, they might refer to stenosis there. But usually they're talking about a blood vessel. In this example that I've drawn here it's an artery. So the stenosis is just the narrowing. Now once the blood vessel is narrowed, that restricts the blood supply. So you aren't able to get as much blood through it. So the blood supply is restricted. So restricted blood supply. Put the I there. Restricted blood supply. This restriction of a blood supply that usually leads to some type of loss of function, that's called-- so this restricted blood supply-- this is called ischemia. Another fancy word, but it literally just means restricted blood supply. Ischemia. Now if you have stenosis in one of your blood vessels, in one of your arteries, and it restricts your blood supply. So it leads to ischemia. Let's say let me draw a muscle cell farther over here. Let's say this is a coronary artery that we're dealing with. The muscle cells over here are going to get less oxygen. So this guy-- let me draw this cell right over here. And I'm just drawing an oversimplified diagram. I'm not going to imply that muscle cells really look like that. And actually, they won't be-- well, I won't go into the details here. But this guy's not going to get not enough oxygen. So you can imagine that if we're really zoomed in on the surface of the heart, we're looking at the heart muscle tissue right here. If whoever's heart this was, if they started to go jogging or whatever, and this cell needed more oxygen, probably wouldn't be able to get that oxygen because of the stenosis which caused ischemia. And because of that, it doesn't have enough oxygen so it won't be able to help the heart pump. Remember, this is just one of the muscles in the heart that's going to help it pump the blood properly. So it's going to lead to heart failure. And once again, the word heart failure sounds more dramatic than maybe it really is. It sounds like cardiac arrest, where the heart stops. But heart failure is not saying that the heart is completely failed. It's just saying that the heart is failing its ability to kind of properly do its function. So when this guy goes jogging, because he has a restricted blood supply, because the heart is experiencing ischemia downstream from this stenosis, that's why there's heart failure. So not able to deliver. Now this heart failure, which is due to the ischemia which is due to the stenosis, you would call this heart failure due to coronary artery disease. Let me write it. We talked about that two videos ago. Coronary artery disease. Which is really just kind of an impairing of the heart's function because of reduced blood supply, because of a narrowing in a blood vessel restricts the blood supply ischemia, that is coronary artery disease. And because of coronary artery disease, when this muscle cell in the heart really needs to pump hard-- maybe because someone's going up a hill or climbing stairs-- it's not able to do it because it's not getting enough oxygen. And that inability to properly, for the heart, not just the cell, but for the whole heart, this is just one of many cells that maybe won't be able to pump properly, for the entire heart to not do its job, that is heart failure. Now you've also probably heard the term coronary heart disease. Or maybe just heart disease. These three things are all the same thing. These are all the same. They all imply some type of narrowing or stenosis of arteries that leads to ischemia, reduced blood flow, so that the heart can't function as well as it otherwise could. Now the last thing I want to focus on, and I talked a little bit about it in the last video, is the idea of an infarct or an infarction. These are kind of funny words to say. I'll write it over here. So infarct or infarction. So in the example I've drawn so far, this cell, for example, maybe does not get enough oxygen, especially once the person is going upstairs and all of that, to properly contract and help the heart actually pump. But it's not dead. It's still getting some base level oxygen. Less because of the stenosis and the ischemia, but it still gets some oxygen. And we saw in the video on myocardial infarction or the video on heart attacks that sometimes one of these plaques might become unstable and they break off and then you have a complete blocking of a vessel, a complete blocking of an artery right here. And we saw in the last video, we call this blocking what's called an embolism. And an embolism is the general term for something that floated around and then eventually blocks a vessel. And if it was due to kind of a released plaque that also had clotting factors around it after it got released, then we would call this a thromboembolism. This would reduce the blood flow so much, maybe a little bit might be able to leak around, but it reduces it so much that the cells downstream from this actually die. So you actually have the cell right over here and this cell will die. It might get very little blood or no blood at all, so it's not getting enough oxygen to actually survive. And when you have dead tissue that's due to a loss of oxygen, this is an infarct, dead tissue due to a loss of oxygen. The process of it becoming dead tissue due a loss of oxygen is an infarction. And this infarction, this dead tissue due to loss of oxygen, in the myocardium, in the muscle tissue of the heart. So now all of a sudden you have muscle tissue in the heart that's beginning to die. This is a heart attack. This is a myocardial infarction. So hopefully that clarifies things a little bit.",science_health-and-medicine_healthcare-misc
" We're first exposed to the idea of a slope of a line early on in our algebra careers, but I figure it never hurts to review it a bit. So let me draw some axes. That is my y-axis. Maybe I should call it my f of x-axis. y is equal to f of x. Let me draw my x-axis, just like that, that is my x-axis. And let me draw a line, let me draw a line like this. And what we want to do is remind ourselves, how do we find the slope of that line? And what we do is, we take two points on the line, so let's say we take this point, right here. Let's say that that is the point x is equal to a. And then what would this be? This would be the point f of a, where the function is going to be some line. We could write f of x is going to be equal to mx plus b. We don't know what m and b are, but this is all a little bit of review. So this is a. And then the y-value is what happens to the function when you evaluated it at a, so that's that point right there. And then we could take another point on this line. Let's say we take point b, right there. And then this coordinate up here is going to be the point b, f of b. Right? Because this is just the point when you evaluate the function at b. You put b in here, you're going to get that point right there. So let me just draw a little line right there. So that is f of b, right there. Actually, let me make it clear that this coordinate right is the point a, f of a. So how do we find the slope between these 2 points, or more generally, of this entire line? Because whole the slope is consistent the whole way through it. And we know that once we find the slope, that's actually going to be the value of this m. That's all a review of your algebra, but how do we do it? Well, a couple of ways to think about it. Slope is equal to rise over run. You might have seen that when you first learned algebra. Or another way of writing it, it's change in y over change in x. So let's figure out what the change in why over the change in x is for this particular case. So the change in y is equal to what? Well, let's just take, you can take this guy as being the first point, or that guy as being the first point. But since this guy has a larger x and a larger y, let's start with him. The change in y between that guy and that guy is this distance, right here. So let me draw a little triangle. That distance right there is a change in y. Or I could just transfer it to the y-axis. This is the change in y. That is your change in y, that distance. So what is that distance? It's f of b minus f of a. So it equals f of b minus f of a. That is your change in y. Now what is your change in x The slope is change in y over change in x. So what our change in x? What's this distance? Remember, we're taking this to be the first point, so we took its y minus the other point's y. So to be consistent, we're going to have to take this point x minus this point x. So this point's x-coordinate is b. So it's going to be b minus a. And just like that, if you knew the equation of this line, or if you had the coordinates of these 2 points, you would just plug them in right here and you would get your slope. That straightforward. And that comes straight out of your Algebra 1 class. And let me just, just to make sure it's concrete for you, if this was the point 2, 3, and let's say that this, up here, was the point 5, 7, then if we wanted to find the slope of this line, we would do 7 minus 3, that would be our change in y, this would be 7 and this would be 3, and then we do that over 5 minus 2. Because this would be a 5, and this would be a 2, and so this would be your change in x. 5 minus 2. So 7 minus 3 is 4, and 5 minus 2 is 3. so your slope would be 4/3. Now let's see if we can generalize this. And this is what the new concept that we're going to be learning as we delve into calculus. Let's see if we can generalize this somehow to a curve. So let's say I have a curve. We have to have a curve before we can generalize it to a curve. Let me scroll down a little. Well, actually, I want to leave this up here, show you the similarity. Let's say I have, I'll keep it pretty general right now. Let's say I have a curve. I'll make it a familiar-looking curve. Let's say it's the curve y is equal to x squared, which looks something like that. And I want to find the slope. Let's say I want to find the slope at some point. And actually, before even talking about it, let's even think about what it means to find the slope of a curve. Here, the slope was the same the whole time, right? But on a curve your slope is changing. And just to get an intuition for that means, is, what's the slope over here? Your slope over here is the slope of the tangent line. The line just barely touches it. That's the slope over there. It's a negative slope. Then over here, your slope is still negative, but it's a little bit less negative. It goes like that. I don't know if I did that, drew that. Let me do it in a different color. Let me do it in purple. So over here, your slope is slightly less negative. It's a slightly less downward-sloping line. And then when you go over here, at the 0 point, right here, your slope is pretty much flat, because the horizontal line, y equals 0, is tangent to this curve. And then as you go to more positive x's, then your slope starts increasing. I'm trying to draw a tangent line. And here it's increasing even more, it's increased even more. So your slope is changing the entire time, and this is kind of the big change that happens when you go from a line to a curve. A line, your slope is the same the entire time. You could take any two points of a line, take the change in y over the change in x, and you get the slope for the entire line. But as you can see already, it's going to be a little bit more nuanced when we do it for a curve. Because it depends what point we're talking about. We can't just say, what is the slope for this curve? The slope is different at every point along the curve. It changes. If we go up here, it's going to be even steeper. It's going to look something like that. So let's try a bit of an experiment. And I know how this experiment turns out, so it won't be too much of a risk. Let me draw better than that. So that is my y-axis, and that's my x-axis. Let's call this, we can call this y, or we can call this the f of x axis. Either way. And let me draw my curve again. And I'll just draw it in the positive coordinate, like that. That's my curve. And what if I want to find the slope right there? What can I do? Well, based on our definition of a slope, we need 2 points to find a slope, right? Here, I don't know how to find the slope with 1 point. So let's just call this point right here, that's going to be x. We're going to be general. This is going to be our point x. But to find our slope, according to our traditional algebra 1 definition of a slope, we need 2 points. So let's get another point in here. Let's just take a slightly larger version of this x. So let's say, we want to take, actually, let's do it even further out, just because it's going to get messy otherwise. So let's say we have this point right here. And the difference, it's just h bigger than x. Or actually, instead of saying h bigger, let's just, well let me just say h bigger. So this is x plus h. That's what that point is right there. So what going to be their corresponding y-coordinates on the curve? Well, this is the curve of y is equal to f of x. So this point right here is going to be f of our particular x right here. And maybe to show you that I'm taking a particular x, maybe I'll do a little 0 here. This is x naught, this is x naught plus h. This is f of x naught. And then what is this going to be up here, this point up here, that point up here? Its y-coordinate is going to be f of f of this x-coordinate, which I shifted over a little bit. It's right there. f of this x-coordinate, which is f of x naught plus h. That's its y-coordinate. So what is a slope going to be between these two points that are relatively close to each other? Remember, this isn't going to be the slope just at this point. This is the slope of the line between these two points. And if I were to actually draw it out, it would actually be a secant line between, to the curve. So it would intersect the curve twice, once at this point, once at this point. You can't see it. If I blew it up a little bit, it would look something like this. This is our coordinate x naught f of x naught, and up here is our coordinate for this point, which would be, the x-coordinate would be x naught plus h, and the y-coordinate would be f of x naught plus h. Just whatever this function is, we're evaluating it at this 1x-coordinate That's all it is. 1So these are the 2 points. 1So maybe a good start is to just say, hey, what is the 1slope of this secant line? 1And just like we did in the previous example, you find the 1change in y, and you divide that by your change in x. 1Let me draw it here. 1Your change in y would be that right here, change in y, and 1then your change in x would be that right there. 1So what is the slope going to be of the secant line? 1The slope is going to be equal to, let's start with this 1point up here, just because it seems to be larger. 1So we want a change in y. so this value right here, this 1y-value, is f of x naught plus h. 1I just evaluated this guy up here. 1Looks like a fancy term, but all it means is, look. 1The slightly larger x evaluate its y-coordinate. 1Where the curve is at that value of x. 1So that is going to be, so the change in y is going to be 1a f of x naught plus h. 1That's just the y-coordinate up here. 1Minus this y-coordinate over here. 1So minus f of x naught. 1So that equals our change in y. 1And you want to divide that by your change in x. 1So what is this? 1This is the larger x-value. 1We started with this coordinate, so we start 1with its x-coordinate. 1So it's x naught plus h, x naught plus h. 1Minus this x-coordinate. 1Well, we just picked a general number. 1It's x naught. 1So that is over your change in x. 1Just like that. 1So this is the slope of the secant line. 1We still haven't answered what the slope is right at that 1point, but maybe this will help us get there. 1If we simplify this, so let me write it down like this. 1The slope of the secant, let me write that properly. 1The slope of the secant line is equal to the value of the 1function at this point, f of x naught plus h, minus the value 1of the function here, mine f of x naught. 1So that just tells us the change in y. 1It's the exact same definition of slope we've always used. 1Over the change in x. 1And we can simplify this. 1We have x naught plus h minus x naught. 1So x naught minus x naught cancel out, so you 1have that over h. 1So this is equal to our change in y over change in x. 1Fair enough. 1But I started off saying, I want to find the slope of 1the line at that point, at this point, right here. 1This is the zoomed-out version of it. 1So what can I do? 1Well, I defined second point here as just the first 1point plus some h. 1And we have something in our toolkit called a limit. 1This h is just a general number. 1It could be 10, it could be 2, it could be 0.02, it could be 1 1times 10 to the negative 100. 1It could be an arbitrarily small number. 1So what happens, what would happen, at least theoretically, 1if I were take the limit as h approaches 0? 1So, you know, first, maybe h is this fairly large number over 1here, and then if I take h a little bit smaller, then I'd be 1finding the slope of this secant line. 1If I took h to be even a little bit smaller, I'd be finding the 1slope of that secant line. 1If h is a little bit smaller, I'd be finding 1the slope of that line. 1So as h approaches 0, I'll be getting closer and closer to 1finding the slope of the line right at my point in question. 1Obviously, if h is a large number, my secant line is going 1to be way off from the slope at exactly that point right there. 1But if h is 0.0000001, if it's an infinitesimally small 1number, then I'm going to get pretty close. 1So what happens if I take the limit as h 1approaches zero of this? 1So the limit as h approaches 0 of my secant slope. 1Of, let me switch to green. 1f of x naught plus h minus f of x naught, that was my change in 1y, over h, which is my change in x. 1And now just to clarify something, and sometimes you'll 1see it in different calculus books, sometimes instead of an 1h, they'll write a delta x here. 1Where this second point would have been defined as x naught 1plus delta x, and then, this would have simplified to just 1delta x over there, and we'd be taking the limit as 1delta x approaches 0. 1The exact same thing. 1h, delta x, doesn't matter. 1We're taking h as the difference between one x point 1and then the higher x point, and then we're just going to 1take the limit as that approaches zero. 1We could have called that delta x just as easily. 1But I'm going to call this thing, which equals the slope 1of the tangent line, and it does equal the slope of the 1tangent line, I'm going to call this the derivative of f. 1Let me write that down. 1And I'm going to say that this is equal to f prime of x. 1And this is going to be another function. 1Because remember, the slope changes at every x-value. 1No matter what x-value you pick, the slope is 1going to be different. 1Doesn't have to be, but the way I drew this curve, 1it is different. 1It can be different. 1So now, you give me an x-value in here, I'll apply this 1formula over here, and then I can tell you the 1slope at that point. 1And it all seems very confusing and maybe 1abstract at this point. 1In the next video, I'll actually do an example of 1calculating a slope, and it'll make it everything a 1little bit more concrete.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-differentiation-1-new
" -  We have three times X to the power of A times BX to the fourth power, and we have that equalling negative 24 X to the sixth. And so what I'd like you to do is pause this video and see if you can figure out what A and B need to be. Well to figure this out we can just multiply out this left-hand side, so let's do that. So what we have right over here, we can just rewrite that as three times X to the power of A times B times X to the fourth. And we can rewrite this as, we can just change the order, we're just multiplying four different things. This is the same thing as three times B times X to the A, times X to the fourth. And if you were doing this on your own, you wouldn't have to do all of these steps, but hopefully this makes it clear what's actually going on. And what's this going to be? Well, we have our, let me do this in a new color, we have our three B here. So that is three B, and what's X to the A times X to the fourth? X to the A times X to the fourth. Have the same base raised to different exponents and I'm multiplying the two. Well we know from our exponent properties, this is going to be the same thing as X to the A plus four. X to the A times X to the fourth is X to the A plus four, we're just adding the exponents because we have the same base and we're multiplying these two. So we now have that three B is equal to X to the A plus fourth power. And this is going to be equal to what we have on the right-hand side. So this is going to be equal to, put in that same color, negative 24 X to the sixth. So what could we do now? Well we can recognize that three B is going to have to be equal to negative 24 and the A plus four right over here is going to need to be equal to the six. So let's write that down. Three B is equal to negative 24. Three B is equal to negative 24, you might be able to do that in your head, or if you want to do it a little bit more systematically you could divide both sides by three to solve for your B. And you get B is equal to negative eight. And we can also say that A plus four is equal to six. Subtract four from both sides, you get A is equal to two. And we are done. And you can check it if you want. We can rewrite it as, if we say A is equal to two, we can say three X squared times, instead of B we know that's negative eight, negative eight X to the fourth. What is that going to be equal to? Three times negative eight is negative 24, X squared times X to the fourth is X to the sixth. And once again as I said, you wouldn't necessarily have to do all of these steps if you're doing it on paper, but this is what you're doing even if you look at this, if you looked at the original problem you'd say okay, the coefficients I can multiply those, three times B to get this coefficient over here. So three times B is negative 24, B would have to be negative eight. So B would have to be negative eight here. And you can say X to the A times X to the fourth is X to the sixth. So, well let's see, we're gonna exponents, A plus four is gonna B equal to six, A must be equal to two. So you might be able to do it that simply, but this is what you're doing, even if you're doing it in your head like that.",math_in-in-class-8-math-india-hindi_in-in-8-algebraic-expressions-and-identities-hindi
" Let's say there are a couple of herbs that people believe help prevent the flu. So, to test this, what we do is we wait for flu season and we randomly assign people to three different groups. And over the course of flu season, we have them either in one group taking herb one, in the second group taking herb two, and in the third group they take a placebo. And if you don't know what a placebo is it's something that, to the patient or to the person participating, it feels like they're taking something that you've told them might help them, but it does nothing. It could be just a sugar pill, just so it feels like medicine. The reason why you would even go through the effort of giving them something is because oftentimes there's something called a placebo effect, where people get better just because they're being told that they're being given something that will make them better. So this could, right here, just be a sugar pill, and a very small amount of sugar so it really can't affect the actual likelihood of getting the flu. So over here we have a table, and this is actually called a contingency table. And it has on it in each group the number that got sick, the number that didn't get sick. And so we also can from this calculate the total number. So in group one, we had a total of 120 people. In group two, we had a total of 30 plus 110 is 140 people. And in the placebo group, the group that just got the sugar pill, we had a total of 120 people. And then we could also tabulate the number of people, the total number of people, that got sick. So that's 20 plus 30 is 50 plus 30 is 80. This is the total column right over here. And then the total people that didn't get sick over here is 100 plus 110 is 210 plus 90 is 300, and then the total people here are 380. Both this column and this row should add up to 380. So with that out of the way, let's think about how we can use this information in the contingency table and our knowledge of the chi-square distribution to come up with some conclusion. So let's just make a null hypothesis. Our null hypothesis is that the herbs do nothing. Let's just assume-- let me get some space here-- so let's assume the null hypothesis that the herbs do nothing. And then we have our alternative hypothesis, or alternate hypothesis, that the herbs do something. Notice I don't even care whether they actually improve. I'm just saying they do something. They might even increase your likelihood of getting the flu. We're not testing whether they're actually good. We're just saying, are they different than just doing nothing. So like we do with all of our hypothesis tests, let's just assume the null. We're going to assume the null and, given that assumption, figure out if the likelihood of getting data like this or more extreme is really low. And if it is really low, then we will reject the null hypothesis. And in this test, like every hypothesis test, we need a significance level. And let's say our significance level we care about for whatever reason is 10% or 0.10. That's the significance level that we care about. Now to do this, we have to calculate a chi-square statistic for this contingency table. And to do that, we do it very similar to what we did with the restaurant situation. We figure out, assuming the null hypothesis, the expected results you would've gotten in each of these cells. You could view each of these entries as a cell. You know that's what we do with it. You call each of those entries in Excel also a cell, each of the entries in a table. What we do is we figure out what the expected value would have been if you do assume the null hypothesis. Then we find the squared distance from that expected value, and we, I guess you could call it, normalize it by the expected value. Take the sum of all of those differences, and if those squares differences are really big, the probability of getting it would be really small, and maybe we'll reject the null hypothesis. So let's just figure out how we can get the expected number. So we're assuming the herbs do nothing. So if the herbs do nothing, then we can just figure out that this whole population just had nothing happen to them. These herbs were useless. And so we can use this population sample-- or I shouldn't call it the population-- we should use this sample right here to figure out the expected number of people who would get sick or not sick. And so over here, we have 80 out of 380 did not get sick. And I want to be careful, I just said the word population, but we haven't sampled the whole universe of all people taking this herb. This is a sample. So I don't want to confuse you. I was using population in more of the conversational sense than the statistical sense. But anyway, of our sample-- and we're using all of the data because we're assuming there's no difference. We might as well just use the total data to figure out the expected frequency of getting sick and not getting sick. So 80 divided by 380 did not get sick. And that's 21%. 21% did not get sick. So let me write that over here. So 21, and that's 21% of the total, and then this would be 79% if we just subtract 1 minus 21. We could divide 300 by 380, and we should get 79% as well. So you would expect-- one would expect-- that 21% of your total, based on the total sample right over here, that our best guess is that 21% percent should be getting sick and 79% should not be getting sick. So let's look at it for each of these groups. If we assume that 21% of these 120 people should have gotten sick, what would have been the expected value right over here? So let's just multiply 21% times 120. So let's just multiply that times 120. That gets us to 25 point-- I'll just round it-- 25.3 people should have gotten sick. So the expected-- so let me write it over here, I'll do expected in yellow-- so the expected right over here. If you assume that 21% of each group should have gotten sick is that you would have expected 25.3 people to get sick in group one, in herb one group. And then the remainder will not get sick. So let's just subtract or I could actually multiply 79% times 120, either one of those would be good. But let me just take 120 minus 25.3, and then I get 94.7. So you would have expected 94.7 to not get sick. So this is expected again. 94.7 to not get sick. And now let's do that for each of these groups. So once again, group two, you would've expected 21% to get sick. 21% of the total people in that group, so that's 140, so that's 29.4. And then the remainder-- let's see, 140 minus 29.4-- should not have gotten sick. So that gets us this right here. We have 29.4 should have gotten sick if the herbs did nothing. And then, over here, we would have 110.6 should not have gotten sick. And these are pretty close. So, just looking at the numbers, it looks this herb doesn't do too much relative to the total, all of the groups combined. And then in the placebo group, let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. We expect 21% to get sick, 21% of our group of 120. So it's 25.2. So this right over here. And actually, this should be 25 point-- since we're rounding, actually, these will be the same number over here-- so I said 21%, but it's 21 point something something something. The group sizes are the same, so we should expect the same proportion to get sick. So I'll say 25.3 just to make it consistent. The reason why I got 25.2 just now is because I lost some of the trailing decimals over here. But since I had them over here, I'm going to use them over here as well. And then over here in this group, you would expect 94.7 to get sick. So if you just actually relied on this data, it looks like herb two is actually, to some degree, even worse than the-- oh. No, no, I take that back. It's not worse because you would have expected a small number, and a lot of people got sick here. So this is the placebo-- Well anyway, we don't want to make judgments just staring at the numbers. Let's figure out our chi-square statistic. And to do that, let's get our statistic, our chi-square statistic. I'll write it like this, maybe, for fun. Or maybe I'll write it as a big X because it's really, this random variables distribution, is approximately a chi-square distribution. So I'll write it like that. And, well, we'll talk about the degrees of freedom in a second. Actually, let me write it with the curly X, just so you see that some people write it with the chi instead of the X. So our chi-square statistic over here. We're literally just going to find the squared distance between the observed and expected. And then divide it by the expected. So it's going to be 20 minus 25.3 squared over 25.3 plus 30 minus 29.4 squared over 29.4-- I'm 1going to run out of space-- plus 30 minus 25.3 squared 1over 25.3. 1And then I'm going to have to do these over here, 1so let me just continue it. 1You could ignore this H1 over here. 1So plus 100 minus 94.7 squared over 194.7 plus-- I think you see where this is going-- 1110 minus 110.6 squared over 110.6. 1And then, finally, plus 90 minus 94.7-- 1let me scroll to the right a little bit-- 1squared, all of that over 94.7. 1So let me just get the calculator out 1to calculate this. 1Take a little bit of time. 1So we have-- I have to type on the calculator 1for these parentheses-- so we have 20 minus 25.3 squared 1divided by 25.3 plus, open parentheses, 30 minus 29.4 1squared divided by 29.4 plus, open parentheses, 30 minus 25.3 1squared divided by 25.3-- halfway 1there-- plus 100, open parentheses, 1this is the tedious part, 100 minus 94.7 squared 1divided by 94.7 plus 110 minus-- I'll let you type 1it out, we can do a lot of these in our head, 1but let me just do it-- 110 minus 110.6 squared 1divided by 110.6-- and then last one, homestretch, 1assuming we haven't made any mistakes-- 1we have 90 minus 94.7 squared divided by 94.7. 1And let's see what we get. 1We get 2.528, so let's just say it's 2.53. 1So our chi-square statistic-- always 1have trouble saying that-- our chi-square statistic, assuming 1the null hypothesis is correct, is equal to 2.53. 1Now, the next thing we have to do 1is figure out the degrees of freedom 1that we had in calculating the chi-square statistic. 1And I'll give you the rule of thumb, 1and I'll give you a little bit of a sense of why 1this is the rule of thumb for a contingency table like this. 1And in the future, we'll talk a little bit more 1deeply about degrees of freedom. 1So the rule of thumb for a contingency table 1is you have the number of rows, so you have rows, 1and then you have your number of columns. 1So here we have two rows, and we have three columns. 1You don't count the totals. 1So you have three columns over here. 1And the degrees of freedom, and this is the rule of thumb, 1the degrees of freedom for your contingency table 1is going to be the number of rows minus 1 times the number 1of columns minus 1. 1In our situation, we have 2 rows and 3 columns. 1So it's going to be 2 minus 1 times 3 minus 1. 1So it's going to be 2 minus 1 times 3 minus 1, 1which is just 1 times 2, which is 2. 1We have 2 degrees of freedom. 1Now, the reason that that should make 1a little bit of intuitive sense, we'll 1talk about this in more depth in the future, 1is that if you assume that you know the totals. 1So let's just assume that you know the totals. 1So if you know all of this information over here, 1if you know the total information-- or actually, 1if you knew the parameters of the population as well-- 1but if you know the total information, 1and if you know this information, 1or if you know r minus 1 of the information in the rows, 1the last one can be figured out just 1by subtracting from the total. 1So for example, in this situation, if you know this, 1you can easily figure out this. 1This is not new information, it's just the total minus 20. 1Same thing, if you know this one right over here, 1this one over here is not new information. 1And similarly, if you know these two, this guy over here 1isn't new information. 1You could always just calculate him 1based on the total and everything else. 1So that's the sense of why our degrees of freedom 1are the columns minus 1 times the rows minus 1. 1But anyway, so our chi-square statistic 1has 2 degrees of freedom. 1So what we have to do is remember our alpha value-- let 1me get it up here, we had it right 1over here-- our significance level that we care about, 1our alpha value is 10%. 1Let me rewrite it over here. 1So our alpha is 10%. 1So what we're going to do is figure out 1what is our critical chi-square statistic that 1gives us an alpha of 10%. 1If this is more extreme than that-- 1if the probability of getting this 1is even less than that critical statistic-- 1it'll be less than 10%, and we'll 1reject the null hypothesis. 1If it's not more extreme, then we 1won't reject the null hypothesis. 1So what we need to do is to figure out 1with the chi-square distribution and 2 degrees of freedom, what 1is our critical chi-square statistic. 1So let's just go back. 1So we have 2 degrees of freedom. 1We care about a significance level of 10%. 1So our critical chi-square value is 4.60. 1So another way to visualize this. 1If we look at the chi-square distribution with 2 degrees 1of freedom, that's this blue one over here, 1at a value of-- I'm trying to pick a nice blue to use-- 1at a critical value of 4.60. 1So 4.60-- this is 5-- so 4.60 will be right around here. 1At a critical value of 4.60, so this is 4.60, 1the probability of getting something at least that 1extreme, so that extreme or more extreme, is 10%. 1This is what we care about. 1Now, if the chi-square statistic that we calculated 1falls into this rejection region, 1then we're going to reject the null hypothesis. 1But our chi-square statistic is only 2.53. 1It is only 2.53. 1So it's sitting someplace right over here is actually ours. 1So it's actually not that crazy to get it 1if you assume the null hypothesis. 1So based on our data that we have right now, 1we cannot reject the null hypothesis. 1So we don't know for a fact that the herbs do nothing, 1but we can't say that they do something based on this. 1So we're not going to reject it. 1We won't say 100% that it's true, 1but we can't say that we're rejecting it. 1So at least from this point of view, 1it doesn't look like the herbs did anything 1that would make us believe that they're 1any different than each other. 1And one of the herbs is obviously a placebo. 1So any different than a placebo or each other.",math_statistics-probability_inference-categorical-data-chi-square-tests
" We've got 24 triangle things right over here. And what I want to do in this video is to divide it into different numbers of groups. So the first thing I want to do is I want to divide this 24 triangle things into 3 groups and think about how many do I end up per group. So let's try that out. So I'm going to divide it into 3 equal groups. So that is one equal group right over there. Then I have another equal group right over here. And then I have a third equal group right over here. So if I divide 24 into 3 equal groups-- 1, 2, 3-- how many are going to be in each group? Well, we can count that. We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in each group. So we could say that 24 divided by 3 is equal to 8. Now, you might say, hey, this is very similar to what we saw in multiplication. In multiplication, we said if we have 3 groups of 8, we could view that as 3 times 8 and get 24. And you are exactly right. Let me do those same colors-- we could also write that 3 times 8-- so if I have 3 groups of 8, that that is going to be equal to 24. So when we started in this video, we had 24 things. We want to divide it into 3 equal groups. We got 8 in each group, or you could say 3 equal groups of 8 is equal to 24. But there's even other ways of thinking about this. So let me clear this up a little bit. So let me clear that. So in the first example, I divided 24 into 3 equal groups. But you could also view 24 divided by 3 as dividing 24 into groups of 3. So let's think about what that looks like. So if we divide it into groups of 3, then, for example, this is a group of 3. That is a group of 3. This is a group of 3. You might see where this is going. That's a group of 3. That is another group of 3. And we're going to think about how many groups of 3 we're actually going to get. So this is another group of 3. And that's another group of 3. So how many groups of 3 did we get? Let's see, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 groups of 3. So another way of viewing 24 divided by 3 is divide 24 into groups of 3. And then you will have 8 groups of 3. And one way of thinking about this-- if you want to express the same thing in terms of multiplication-- is if you have 8 groups of 3, that is also going to be equal to 24. Whether you have 3 groups of 8 or 8 groups of 3, either way, you're going to have 24. Now, let's make things more interesting. What I want you to think about is, based on what we just saw, what is 24 divided by 12? And I encourage you to pause the video, draw out 24 triangles like this, and try to figure out what 24 divided by 12 is. Well, I assume you've paused the video. And there's two ways to think about 24 divided by 12. You could say, well, let's divide 24 into groups of 12 and think about how many groups we have. So we could do that. So let's see. This is one group of 12 right over here. That's one group of 12, and then here is another group of 12. So how many groups of 12 do we have? Well, we have 2 groups of 12. So we could say 24 divided by 12 is 2. But another just as reasonable way of doing this is you could have said, well, let me divide 24 into 12 groups instead of groups of 12. So if I want to divide it into 12 groups, 12 equal groups-- well, let's see. This is 1 equal group, 2 equal groups-- actually let me do it this way. Well, let me do this-- 2 equal groups, 3 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. So once again, if you say, oh, I'm going to divide 24 into 12 equal groups, how many do you have in each group? Well, you have 2. So once again, 24 could be viewed as 24 divided into 12 equal groups. And how many do you have in each group? Or 24 divided into groups of 12, and how many groups would you have? And that's what we saw in the last example. So now, let's make things even more interesting. What I want you to think about-- a couple of things. I want you think about what 24 divided by 6 is. And I also want you to figure out what 24 divided by-- let me use that same color-- 4 is. And once again, I encourage you to pause the video, draw these triangles, and figure it out. What is 24 divided by 6 and 24 divided by 4? So let's tackle 24 divided by 6 first. And let's try to divide 24 into 6 equal groups. So let's see. This could be 1 equal group, 2 equal groups-- in fact, each group here is a group of 4. And we have 6 rows. So 3 equal groups, 4, 5, and 6. And so if you divide 24 into 6 equal groups, how many do you have in each group? Well, it's pretty clear you have 4. You have 4 In each group. Another way we could have thought about that is we could have said, let me divide 24 into groups of 6. So if you divided 24 into groups of 6, you could have viewed it like this. So that's 1 group of 6 right there. That's another group of 6 right over here. That's another group of 6. And I think you see how many groups of 6 we have. How many groups of 6 do we have? We have 4. We have 4 groups of 6. Well, now let's think about what 24 divided by 4 is. Well, if I view 24 divided by 4 as taking 24 and dividing it into 4 equal groups, I've just drawn that. I have 4 equal groups, and in each group I have 6. So notice 24 divided by 6 is 4. 24 divided by 4 is 6. And that's because I could view this as 4 groups of 6 or say that 4 times 6 is equal to 24. Or you could just as equivalently say that 6 times 4 is 24. You could equivalently say that 6 times 4 is equal to 24.",math_5th-grade-foundations-engageny_5th-m4-engage-ny-foundations
" -  Let's get some practice now thinking about how ions typically form, how they might form compounds and how we name those compounds. So let's start with something in group one. In this first column, this first column is often known as alkali metals. So let's start with potassium. K is the symbol for potassium. Now things in group one here, one way to think about is their outermost shell has one electron in it. So they wouldn't mind losing that electron. So when they ionize, they tend to lose an electron and become a cation, a positive ion. And so let's look at a situation where I have some potassium that has been ionized. I could write it just like this, we've seen that in previous videos and we can refer to this just as a potassium ion, we could refer to this as potassium one plus. We could refer to this as a potassium cation. Now let's go on to the other side of the periodic table. Things that would really love to grab an electron. So things in group, in the halides, which is this column right over here. So these are the halides. They have seven electrons in their outermost shell. They would love to have eight, so they tend to be really good at grabbing electrons. And so let's say we're dealing with chlorine, and chlorine is able to ionize. So it's able to grab an electron. When chlorine grabs an electron, it will be a negatively charged ion, so you could write it as Chlorine one minus, but the way that we generally refer to an anion, a negatively charged ion, instead of just calling this the chlorine anion, we would call this chloride. So this we would refer to as Chloride. Now as you can imagine with potassium having a positive one charge or one plus charge and this having a negative charge, they're going to be attracted to each other and they can actually form an ionic compound. The ionic compound they would form, we would write as, you'd write your positive ion first and then you would write your negative ion. And this right over here would be described as potassium chloride. Let me write that down. Potassium, potassium chloride. Now you might be saying, ""Well, I just,"" Let me rewrite the whole thing. So you know the chloride part, you say okay, this is going to be an anion because instead of writing chlorine which is the name of this element, I wrote this IDE at the end to say, ""Hey, this is an anion,"" so I know that this is the chlorine anion, this is chloride, why didn't I do something similar for potassium? Well, the way the convention works is if someone says potassium chloride, you know you're dealing with an ionic compound and if the chlorine has a negative one charge, an ionic compound, the whole thing is gonna be neutral. So if this one over here is one minus, then you know this over here is just one-for-one, this is going to be one plus so you know that you're dealing with a potassium cation and you could say and a chloride ion or a chlorine anion. You could refer to it various ways, but this is potassium chloride. You have a positively charged potassium and you have a negatively charged chlorine, which we would call a chloride. In the next few videos I'll do many, many more examples of this and ones that will be a little bit more complicated.",science_chemistry_atomic-structure-and-properties
" -  Ify is building a tree tower, which is a tower built on top of a tree. The tree is currently five meters tall and Ify has found, I don't know if it's Ify or Ify, and Ify has found that it is growing by zero point one meters a month or a tenth of a meter a month. The tower is currently two meters tall. So this tower that sits on top of the tree, is two meters tall currently and Ify, or Ify, adds to it at about zero point two meters a month. So, I guess, he or she, I don't know, Ify, let's just say, ""he."" Is continuously building this tower on this continuously growing tree, which is fascinating. Alright, the function A of m, returns the tree's height in meters and months from now. Fascinating. The function B of m, returns the tower's height in meters and months from now. So, this is the tree's height, A of m, is the tree's height. B of m is the tower's height. Find the formula of the two functions. So, A of m, so they tell us the tree is currently five meters tall. So, it's going to be five meters tall right at the start. And then every month it is growing by zero point one meters, so it's going to be five plus zero point one times m. And this m here, this is not meters, this is actually the months. Remember, m returns, m is the number of months. So after zero months,which is right now, well this is just going to be five. After one month, it's going to be five point one. After two months it's going to be five point two. Which is exactly what we want. Alright, now let's think about the tower. So, the formula for B of m, so the tower is currently two meters tall. So, it's currently two meters tall and it grows at two tenths of a meter per month. So, two tenths times the number of months. And once again, this m right over here is not meters, I'm not writing the units here, we're just assuming whatever this returns is in meters. This m right over here is the number of months that pass by, the number of months from now. Alright, the function C of m returns the vertical distance between the ground and the top end of the tower. Makes sense, that would be from the bottom of the tree to the top of the tower. Wright the formula, C of m, in terms of A of m and B of m. Well the total height is going to be the height of the tree, which is A of m plus the height of the tower. Plus B of m, plus B of m. That's what C of m is going to be. And then they say, ""Wright the formula of C of m in terms of m."" Well, we just need to add these two functions. So, if we add five plus zero point one m to two plus zero point two m, that's going to be, we could add five plus two, and we'er going to get seven, plus, and if I have point one m and I add another point 2 m, that's going to be point 3 m. Zero point 3 m, and we are done. And we got it right.",math_algebra2_modeling
" I've talked a lot about using polynomials to approximate functions, but what I want to do in this video is actually show you that the approximation is actually happening. So right over here-- and I'm using WolframAlpha for this. It's a very cool website. You can do all sorts of crazy mathematical things on it. So WolframAlpha.com-- I got this copied and pasted from them. I met Steven Wolfram at a conference not too long ago. He said yes, you should definitely use WolframAlpha in your videos. And I said, great. I will. And so that's what I'm doing right here. And it's super useful, because what it does is-- and we could have calculated a lot of this on our own, or even done it on a graphic calculator. But you usually can do it just with one step on WolframAlpha-- is see how well we can approximate sine of x using-- you could call it a Maclaurin series expansion, or you could call it a Taylor series expansion-- at x is equal to 0 using more and more terms. And having a good feel for the fact that the more terms we add, the better it hugs the sine curve. So this over here in orange is sine of x. That should hopefully look fairly familiar to you. And in previous videos, we figured out what that Maclaurin expansion for sine of x is. And WolframAlpha does it for us as well. They actually calculate the factorials. 3 factorial is 6, 5 factorial is 120, so on and so forth. But what's interesting here is you can pick how many of the approximations you want to graph. And so what they did is if you want just one term of the approximation-- so if we didn't have this whole thing. If we just said that our polynomial is equal to x, what does that look like? Well, that's going to be this graph right over here. They tell us which term-- how many terms we used by how many dots there are right over here, which I think is pretty clever. So this right here, that is the function p of x is equal to x. And so it's a very rough approximation, although for sine of x, it doesn't do a bad job. It hugs the sine curve right over there. And then it starts to veer away from the sine curve again. You add another term. So if you have the x minus x to the third over 6. So now you have two terms in the expansion. Or I guess we should say we were up to the third-order term, because that's how their numbering the dots. Because they're not talking about the number of terms. They're talking about the order of the terms. So they have one dot here, because we have only one first-degree term. When we have two terms here, since we-- when you do the expansion for sine of x, it doesn't have a second-degree term. We now have a third-degree polynomial approximation. And so let's look at the third-degree. We should look for three dots. That's this curve right over here. So if you just have that first term, you just get that straight line. You add the negative x to the third over 6 to that x. You now get a curve that looks like this. And notice it starts hugging sine a little bit earlier. And it keeps hugging it a little bit later. So once again, just adding that second term does a pretty good job. It hugs the sine curve pretty well, especially around smaller numbers. You add another term. And now we're at an order five polynomial, right over here. So x minus x to the third over 6 plus x to the fifth over 120. So let's look for the five dots. So that's this one right over here-- one, two, three, four, five. So that's this curve right over here. And notice it begins hugging the line a little bit earlier than the magenta version, and it keeps hugging it a little bit longer. Then it flips back up like this. So it hugged it a little bit longer. And you can see I'll keep going. If you have all these first four terms, it gives us a seventh degree polynomial. So let's look for the seven dots over here. So they come in just like this. And then once again, it hugs the curve sooner than when we just had the first three terms. And it keeps hugging the curve all the way until here. And then the last one. If you have all of these terms up to x to the ninth, it does it even more. You start here. It hugs the curve longer than the others. And goes out. And if you think about it, it makes sense, because what's happening here is each successive term that we're adding to the expansion, they have a higher degree of x over a much, much, much, much larger number. So for small x value-- so when you're close to the origin for small x values, this denominator is going to overpower the numerator, especially when you're below 1. Because when you take something that has absolute value less than 1 to a power, you're actually shrinking it down. So when you're close to the origin, these latter terms don't matter much. So you're kind of not losing some of the precision of some of the earlier terms. When these tweaking terms come in, these come in when the numerator can start to overpower the denominator. So this last term, it starts to become relevant out here, where all of a sudden x to the ninth can overpower 362,880. And the same thing on the negative side. So hopefully this gives you a sense. We only have one, two, three, four, five terms here. Imagine what would happen if we had an infinite number of terms. I think you get a pretty good sense that it would kind of hug the sine curve out to infinity. So hopefully that makes you feel a little bit better about this. And for fun, you might want to go type in-- you can type in Taylor expansion at 0 and sine of x, or Maclaurin expansion or Maclaurin series for sine of x, cosine of x, e to the x, at WolframAlpha.com. And try it out for a bunch of different functions. And you can keep adding or taking away terms to see how well it hugs the curve.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-series
" -  We have the graph of y is equal to h of x right over here. They ask us does the intermediate value theorem apply to h over the closed interval from negative one to four. The closed interval from negative one to four right over here. We can first remind ourselves what is the intermediate value theorem. Although you don't have to even know what the theorem is actually saying, you just have to remember that the intermediate value theorem only applies over closed intervals where the function is continuous. You just have to say, you might be tempted to say wait, wait this function has a point of discontinuity but this is outside of that interval. The interval we care about at negative one, this is the value of h of x and then at four this is the value of h of x and you can see over that entire interval right over here, the function is continuous. First, I would definitely say it meets the continuity requirement, it's continuous over this closed interval. I would say yes, it does, the intermediate value theorem does apply. Since it does apply, I will be able to say that by the intermediate value theorem because we are continuous over this closed interval, the function in this case, h of x will take on every value between h of negative one and h of four, including those values. H of negative one, eyeballing it, looks like it's negative three. H of four looks like it's zero. We know by the intermediate value theorem that we take on every value between negative three and zero. You can even see that right over here. It actually does take on every one of those values in this part of the curve right over there. Let's do another example. Here we're asked does the extreme value theorem apply to g over the closed interval from zero to five. Once again before we even think about what the extreme value theorem says, we have to remember that just like the intermediate value theorem it only applies over closed intervals where the function is continuous over the entire interval. Let's see, is our function continuous on the closed interval from zero to five? From zero to five. No we clearly have a discontinuity right over here at x is equal to three. First of all, we would say no. We can't say that over this closed interval, that we have a well defined maximum or minimum value. This is actually very clear over here that you don't have well defined maximum value, we approach infinity over there and then we approach negative infinity over there. Extreme value theorem does not apply. If instead it had offered us a closed interval where we were continuous, say they said between negative two and zero, let's say it's that interval. It is a different color. Say it's between negative two and zero. Then the extreme value theorem would apply where you would say okay, over this interval, the function has a well defined minimum value and a maximum value. In this case it would actually be, the maximum would happen at the right bound and the minimum value happens at the left bound. But for this case, the closed interval, the one that we started with, definitely is not continuous so we do not, we would not say that the extreme value theorem applies. Let's do one more example. Does the extreme value theorem apply to f over the interval from negative five to negative two? Once again, let's just look at the interval. We're going from negative five to negative two. This is our function over that interval from x equals negative five to x equals negative two. Even though there is a discontinuity in this graph that we see, it's sitting outside of the interval. We only care about what's happening inside of the interval. There we actually are continuous. We're continuous over this closed interval. Because of that we know that the extreme value theorem would apply, that there is a well defined minimum and maximum value over the interval. You can see that the maximum value here happens when at f of negative two, it's looks like it's around negative 3.5 or so, or negative 3.6. Then the minimum value over this interval looks like it happens at f of negative five. It looks like it's pretty close to negative four because it looks like we're just increasing over this entire interval. But the important thing here is to recognize continuity. Continuity does not have to apply to the entire function or over its entire domain, it just has to be true over the closed interval that we are trying to apply these theorems to.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-existence-theorems
" -  We're told that Lauren uses a blend of dark roast beans and light roast beans to make coffee at her cafe. She needs 80 kilograms of beans in total for her next order. Dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram, light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram, and she wants to spend $220 in total. And they tell us here's a graph that shows a system of equations for this scenario where x is the number of kilograms of dark roast beans she buys and y is the number of kilograms of light roast beans she buys. All right, let me scroll down so we can take a look at this. And so sure enough, so this blue line, and I'll write it out in blue, this x is the number of kilograms of dark roast beans, y is the number of kilograms of light roast beans, and she wants to buy a total of 80 kilograms. That's what they told us up here. We can go back to look at that. She needs, I'll underline this in blue. She needs 80 kilograms of beans. So that constraint that the sum of the kilograms of dark and light is equal to 80, that's represented by this equation. And if we were to graph it, that is this blue line right over here. And then this other constraint, three x, well, the dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram, so three x is how much she spends on dark roast. Two y is how much she spends on light roast 'cause it's $2 per kilogram. And 220 is the amount that she spends in total. And they tell us that up here. Dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram, light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram, and she wants to spend $220. So this equation is another way of expressing what I just underlined up here in green. And the green line shows all of the x y combinations that would match these constraints. And so now let's do something interesting. They've labeled some points here, point C, D, F, and E. And we're gonna think about what do each of these points represent? So for example, this point C that is on the green line, but it sits above the blue line, what does this tell us? What does this point C represent? Pause this video and think about it. Well, if we're on the green line, that means that the amount that she spends on dark roast plus the amount that she spends on light roast is adding up to exactly $220. So she's definitely spending $220 at C, but how many total kilograms is she using? Well, the fact that for this given x, we're sitting above the line, that means that she's not using exactly 80 kilograms. And we can see that over here. She's using, looks like 10 kilograms of dark, and it looks like something like 95 kilograms of light. If you were to add those two points together, it looks like she's using something closer to 105 kilograms. So point C is a situation where she is spending exactly $220, but she's using more than 80 kilograms 'cause it's not meeting this second constraint. It's sitting above that line. Now let's think about point D. What does that represent? Pause the video and try to figure that out. Well, because we sit on the blue line, that means that we are meeting this constraint that the kilograms of dark and light combined is equal to 80 kilograms. So she's using exactly 80 kilograms here, but what about her spending? Well, because this point lies below the green line, that tells us that we are spending less than $220. And we could even try it out. Three times 20 plus two times 60 is what? 60 plus 120 is $180. And so this is a point where we're meeting this constraint, but we're not meeting this constraint. We're underspending right over here. Now, what about point F? Well, point F sits below both of these lines. So pause your video and think about what that means. Well, if we're sitting below both of these lines, that means that neither are we spending $220, nor are we using 80 kilograms. And you can see that if you actually look at the numbers. You don't have to do this, but this is just to make you feel good about it. It looks like she is using 30 kilograms of dark and 30 kilograms of light, so in total she is using, so this is a situation where she's using 60 kilograms in total, not 80. And so that's why we're not sitting on this blue line. And if you look at how much she's spending, she has 30 kilograms of each, so three times 30 plus two times 30, that's going to be 90 plus 60. That's also less than 220, and so that's why we see this point is below these lines. And then last but not least, what does point E represent? Well, point E sits on both of these lines, so that means that it meets both of these constraints. This is a situation where she is spending exactly $220, and the total number of kilograms she's using of dark and light is exactly 80. And so if we wanted to say, hey, what combination of dark and light would she need in order to meet both constraints, E represents that, the intersection of these two lines.",math_math1_systems
" So in this problem here, we're told that the triangle ACE is isosceles. So that's this big triangle right here. It's isosceles, which means it has two equal sides, and we also know from isosceles triangles that the base angles must be equal. So these two base angles are going to be equal. And this side right over here is going to be equal in length to this side over here. We could say AC is going to be equal to CE, so we get all of that from this first statement right over there. Then they give us some more clues, or some more information. They say CG is equal to 24. So this is CG right over here. It has length 24. They tell us BH is equal to DF, so those two things are going to be congruent. They're going to be the same length. Then they tell us that GF is equal to 12. So this is GF right over here. So GF is equal to 12. That's that distance right over there. And then finally, they tell us that FE is equal to 6. So this is FE, and then finally, they ask us, what is the area of CBHFD? They're asking us for the area of this part right over here. That part and that part right over there. That is CBHFD. So let's think about how we can do this. So we could figure out the area of the larger triangle, and then from that we could subtract the areas of these little pieces at the end. Then, we'll be able to figure out this middle area, this area that I've shaded. And we don't have all the information yet to solve that. We know what the height, or the altitude, of this triangle is, but we don't know its base. If we knew its base, then we'd say, hey, 1/2 base times height. We'd get the area of this triangle, and then we'd have to subtract out these areas. We don't have full information there, either. We don't know this height. Once we know that height, then we could figure out this height, but we also don't quite yet know what this length right over here is. So let's just take it piece by piece. So the first thing we might want to do, and you might guess, because we've been talking a lot about similarity, is making some type of argument about similarity here, because there's a bunch of similar triangles. For example, triangle CGE shares this angle with triangle DFE. They both share this orange angle right here, and they both have this right angle right over here. So they have two angles in common. They're going to be similar by angle-angle. And you can actually show that there's going to be a third angle in common, because these two are parallel lines. So we can write that triangle CGE is similar to triangle DFE, and we know that by angle-angle. We have one set of corresponding angles congruent, and then this angle is in both triangles, so it is a set of corresponding congruent angles right over there. And so then, once we know that they are similar, we can set up the ratio between sides, because we have some information about some of the sides. So we know that the ratio between DF and this side right over here, which is a corresponding side-- the ratio between DF and CG, which is 24, is going to be the same thing as the ratio between FE, which is 6, and GE, which is not 12. It's 12 plus 6. It is 18. And then, let's see. 6 over 18, this is just 1 over 3. You get 3DF is equal to 24. I just cross-multiplied, or you could multiply both sides by 24, multiply both sides by 3. You would get this. Actually, you could just multiply both sides times 24, and you'll get 24 times 1/3. But we'll just do it this way. Divide both sides by 3. You get DF is equal to 8. So we found out that DF is equal to 8, that length right over there. And that's useful for us because we know that this length right over here is also equal to 8. And now what can we do? Well, it seems like we could make another similarity argument, because we have this angle right over here. It is congruent to that angle right over there, and we also have this angle, which is going to be 90 degrees. We have a 90-degree angle there. And actually, that by itself is actually enough to say that we have two similar triangles. We don't even have to show that they have a congruent side here. And actually, we're going to show that these are actually congruent triangles that we're dealing with right over here. So we have two angles, and actually, we could just go straight to that. Because when we talk about congruency, if you have an angle that's congruent to another angle, another angle that's congruent to another angle, and then a side that's congruent to another side, you are dealing with two congruent triangles. So we can write-- let me write it over here. I'll write it in pink. Triangle AHB is congruent to-- you want to get the corresponding vertices right-- is congruent to triangle EFD. And we know that, because we have angle-angle-side postulate for congruency. And if the two triangles are congruent, that makes things convenient. That means if this side is 8, that side is 8. We already knew that. That's how we established our congruency. But that means if this side has length 6, then the corresponding side of this triangle is also going to have length 6. So we can write this length right over here is also going to be 6. I can imagine you can imagine where all this is going to go, but we want to prove to ourselves. We want to know for sure what the area is. We don't want to say, hey, maybe this is the same thing as that. Let's just actually prove it to ourselves. So how do we figure it out? We've almost figured out the entire base of this triangle, but we still haven't figured out the length of HG. Well, now we can use a similarity argument again, because we can see that triangle ABH is actually similar to triangle ACG. They both have this angle here, and then they both have a right angle. ABH has a right angle there. ACG has a right angle right over there. So you have two angles. Two corresponding angles are equal to each other. You're now dealing with similar triangles. So we know that triangle ABH-- I'll just write it as AHB, since I already wrote it this way. AHB is similar to triangle AGC. You want to make sure you get the vertices in the right order. A is the orange angle. G is the right angle, and then C is the unlabeled angle. This is similar to triangle AGC. And what that does for us is now we can use the ratios to figure out what HG is equal to. So what could we say over here? Well, we could say that 8 over 24-- BH over its corresponding side of the larger triangle-- so we say 8 over 24 is equal to 6 over not HG, but over a AG. 6 over AG, and I think you can see where this is going. You have 1/3. 1/3 is equal to 6 over AG, or we can cross-multiply here, and we can get AG is equal to 18. So this entire length right over here is 18. If AG is 18 and AH is 6, then HG is 12. This is what you might have guessed if you were just trying to guess the answer right over here. But now we have proven to ourselves that this base has length of-- well, we have 18 here, and then we have another 18 here. So it has a length of 36. So the entire base here is 36. So that is 36. And so now we can figure out the area of the entire isosceles triangle. So the area of ACE is going to be equal to 1/2 times the base, which is 36, times 24. And so this is going to be the same thing as 1/2 times 36 is 18. 18 times 24. I'll just do that over here on the top. So 18 times 24. 8 times 4 is 32. 1 times 4 is 4, plus 3 is 7. Then we put as 0 here, because we're now dealing not with 2, but 20. You have 2 times 8 is 16. 2 times 1 is 2, plus 1. So it's 360, and then you have a 2, 7 plus 6 is 13. 1 plus 3 is 4. So the area of ACE is equal to 432. But we're not done yet. This area that we care about is the area of the entire triangle minus this area and minus this area right over here. So what is the area of each of these little wedges right over here? So it's going to be 1/2 times 8 times 6. So 1/2 times 8 is 4 times 6. So this is going to be 24 right over there, and this is going to be another 24 right over there. So this is going to be equal to 432 minus 24 minus 24, or minus 48, which is equal to-- and we could try to do this in our head. If we subtract 32, we're going to get to 400. And then we're going to have to subtract another 16. So if you subtract 10 from 400, you get to 390, so that you get to 384-- whatever the units were. If these were in meters, then this would be meters squared. If this was centimeters, this would be centimeters squared. Did I do that right? Let me go the other way. If I add 40 to this, 24 plus another 8 gets me to 432. 1Yup, we're done.",math_engageny-geo_geo-2
" We're told to factor 4x to the fourth y, minus 8x to the third y, minus 2x squared. So to factor this, we need to figure out what the greatest common factor of each of these terms are. So let me rewrite it. So we have 4x to the fourth y, and we have minus 8x to the third y, and then we have minus 2x squared. So in the other videos, we looked at it in terms of breaking it down to its simplest parts, but I think we have enough practice now to be able to do a little bit more of it in our heads. So what is the largest number that divides into all of these? When I say number I'm talking about the actual, I guess, coefficients. We have a 4, an 8, a 2. We don't have to worry about the negative signs just yet. And we say, well, the largest, of, the largest common factor of 2, 8 and 4 is 2. 2 goes into all of them, and obviously that's the largest number that can go into 2. So that is the largest number that's going to be part of the greatest common factor. So let's write that down. So it's going to be 2. And then what's the greatest, I guess, factor, what's the greatest degree of x that's divisible into all three of these? Well, x squared goes into all three of these, and obviously that's the greatest degree of x that can be divided into this last term. So x squared is going to be the greatest common x degree in all of them. 2x squared. And then what's the largest degree of y that's divisible into all of them? Well, these two guys are divisible by y, but this guy isn't, so there is no degree of y that's divisible into all of them. So the greatest common factor of all three of these guys right here is 2x squared. So what we can do now is we can think about each of these terms as the product of the 2x squared and something else. And to figure that something else we can literally undistribute the 2x squared, say this is the same thing, or even before we undistribute the 2x squared, we could say look, 4x to the fourth y is the same thing as 2x squared, times 4x to the fourth y, over 2x squared. Right? If you just multiply this out, you get 4xy. Similarly, you could say that 8x to the third y-- I'll put the negative out front-- is the same thing as 2x squared, our greatest common factor, times 8x to the third y, over 2x squared. And then finally, 2x squared is the same thing as if we factor out 2x squared-- so we have that negative sign out front-- if we factor out 2x squared, it's the same thing as 2x squared, times 2x squared, over 2x squared. This is almost silly what I'm doing here, but I'm just showing you that I'm just multiplying and dividing both of these terms by 2x squared. Multiplying and dividing. Here it's trivially simple. This just simplifies to 2x squared right there, or this 2x squared times 1. That simplifies to 1, maybe I should write it below. But what do these simplify to? So this first term over here, this simplifies to 2x squared times-- now you get 4 divided by 2 is 2, x to the fourth divided by x squared is x squared. And then y divided by 1 is just going to be a y. So it's 2x squared times 2x squared y, and then you have minus 2x squared times, 8 divided by 2 is 4. x to the third divided by x squared is x. And y divided by 1, you can imagine, is just y. And then finally, of course, you have minus 2x squared time-- this right here simplifies to 1-- times 1. Now, if you were to undistribute 2x squared out of the expression, you'd essentially get 2x squared times this term, minus this term, minus this term. Right, if you distribute this out, if you take that out of each of the terms, you're going to get 2x squared times this 2x squared y, minus 4xy, and then you have minus 1, minus 1, and we're done. We've factored the problem. Now, it looks like we did a lot of steps. And the reason why I kind of of went through great pains to show you exactly what we're doing is so you know exactly what we're doing. In the future, you might be able to do this a little bit quicker. You might be able to do many of the steps in your head. You might say OK, let me look at each of these. Well, the biggest coefficient that divides all of these is a 2, so let me put that 2, let me factor 2 out. Well, all of these are divisible by x squared. That's the largest degree of x. Let me factor an x squared out. And this guy doesn't have a y, so I can't factor a y out. So let's see, it's going to be 2x squared times-- and what's this guy divided by 2x squared? Well 4 divided by 2 is 2. x to the fourth divided by x squared is x squared. y divided by 1, there's no other y degree that we factored out, so it's just going to be a y. And then you have minus 8 divided by 2 is 4. x to the third divided by x squared is x. And then you have y divided by say, 1, is just y. And then you have minus 2 divided by 2 is 1. x squared divided by x squared 1, so 2x squared divided by 2x squared is just 1. So in the future, you'll do it more like this, where you kind of just factor it out in your head, but I really want you to understand what we did here. There is no magic. And to realize that there's no magic, you could just use the distributive property to multiply this out again, to multiply it out again, and you're going to see that you get exactly this.",math_math3_factorization
" - Let's say that you've got a bag, and in that bag you put a bunch of marbles. So, let's say you put 50 of these magenta marbles. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, I'm not gonna draw all of them but you get the general idea. There are going to be 50 magenta marbles, and there's also going to be 50 blue marbles. And what you do is, you have these 100 marbles in there, half of them magenta, half of them blue. And before picking a marble out, and you're gonna be blindfolded when you pick a marble out, you shake the bag really good to, so you think, mix them up a little bit. And so, if you were to say theoretically, what is the probability, if you stuck your hand in and you're not looking, what is the probability of picking a magenta? I feel the need to write magenta in magenta. What is the probability of picking a magenta marble? Well, theoretically there's 100 equally likely possibilities, there's 100 marbles in the bag. And 50 of them involve picking a magenta. So, 50 out of 100, when this is the same thing as a 1/2 probability. So you could say, well, ""Theoretically, ""there is a 1/2 probability, I just did the math."" If you say these are 100 equally likely possibilities, 50 of them are picking magenta. Now let's say you actually start doing the experiment. So you literally take a bag with 50 magenta marbles, 50 blue marbles, and then you start picking the marbles, and then you see what marble color you picked, and you put it back in, and then you do it again. And so, let's say that after every time you put your hand in the bag and you take something out of the bag, and you observe what it is, we're gonna call that an experiment. So, after 10 experiments, let's say that you you have picked out seven magenta and three blue. So, is this strange that out of the first 10 experiments, you haven't picked out exactly half of them being magenta, you've picked out seven magenta, and then the other three were blue. Well no, this is definitely a reasonable thing. If the true probability of picking out a magenta is 1/2, it's definitely possible that you could still pick out seven magenta, that just happened to be what your fingers touched. And this isn't a lot of experiments, it's completely reasonable that out of 10, yeah, you could have, later on in statistics we'll define these things in more detail, but there's enough variation in where you might pick that you're not going to always get, especially with only 10 experiments, you're not definitely going to get exactly 1/2. Instead of having five magenta, it's completely reasonable to have seven magenta. So, this really wouldn't cause me a lot of pause. I still wouldn't question what I did here when I calculated this theoretical probability. But let's say you have a lot of time on your hands. And let's say after 10,000 trials here, after 10,000 experiments, and remember the experiment; you're sticking your hand in the bag without looking, your fingers kind of feeling around, picks out a marble, and you observe the marble and you record what you found. And so, let's say after 10,000 experiments, you get 7,000 magenta. Actually I'm gonna do slightly different numbers, so let me make it even more extreme. Let's say you get 8,000 magenta and you have 2,000 blue. Now this is interesting, because here what you're seeing experimentally seems to be very different. And now you have a large number of trials right over here, not just 10. 10 is completely reasonable that, hey you know, I got seven magenta and three blue instead of five and five, but now you've done 10,000. You would've expected if this was the true probability, you would've expected that half of these would've been magenta, only 5,000 magenta and 5,000 blue, but you got 8,000 magenta. Now, this is within the realm of possibility if the true probability of picking a magenta is 1/2, but it's very unlikely that you would've gotten this result with this many experiments, this many trials if the true probability was 1/2. Here your experimental probability is showing, look, out of 10,000 trials, experimental probability here is you had 10,000 trials, or 10,000 experiments I guess you could say. And and in 8,000 of them, you got a magenta marble. And so, this is going to be 80%, or 8/10. So, there seems to be a difference here. The reason why I would take this more seriously is that you had a lot of trials here, you did this 10,000 times. If the true probability was one half, it's very low likelihood that you would've gotten this many magenta. So, when you think about it you're like, ""What's going on here, what are ""possible explanations for this?"" This, I wouldn't have fretted about, after 10 experiments, not a big deal. But after 10,000, this would have caused me pause. Well, why would this happen, I mixed up the bag every time. And there're some different possibilities; maybe the blue marbles are slightly heavier, and so when you shake the bag up enough, the blue marbles settled to the bottom, and you're more likely to pick a magenta marble. Maybe the blue marbles have a slightly different texture to them, in which case, maybe they slip out of your hands, or they're less likely to be gripped on, and so you're more likely to pick a magenta. So, I don't know the explanation, I don't know what's going on in that bag, but if I thought theoretically that the probability should be 1/2, because half of the marbles are magenta, but I'm seeing through my experiments that 80% of what I'm picking out, especially if I did 10,000 of them, if I did this 10,000 times, well, this is going to cause me some pause. I would really start to think about whether it's truly equally likely for me to pick out a red, a magenta versus a blue. Something else must be going on.",math_7th-grade-illustrative-math_unit-8-probability-and-sampling
"  Welcome to the presentation on torque. So, if you watched the presentation on the center of mass, which you should have, you might have gotten a little bit of a glancing view of what torque is. And now we'll do some more in detail. So in general, from the center of mass video, we learned, if this is a ruler and this is the ruler's center of mass.  And if I were to apply force at the center of mass, I would accelerate the whole ruler in the direction of the force. If I have the force applying at the center of mass there, the whole ruler would accelerate in that direction. And we'd figure it out by taking the force we're applying to it and dividing by the mass of the ruler. And in that center of mass video, I imply-- well, what happens if the force is applied here? Away from the center of mass? Well, in this situation, the object, assuming it's a free floating object on the Space Shuttle or something, it will rotate around the center of mass. And that's also true, if we didn't use the center of mass, but instead we fixed the point. Let's say we had another ruler. Although it has less height than the previous one. Instead of worrying about its center of mass, let's say that it's just fixed at a point here. Let's say it's fixed here. So if this could be the hand of a clock, and it's nailed down to the back of the clock right there. So if we were trying to rotate it, it would always rotate around this point. And the same thing would happen. If I were to apply a force at this point, maybe I could break the nail off the back of the clock, or something, but I won't rotate this needle or this ruler, or whatever you want to call it. But if I would apply a force here, I would rotate the ruler around the pivot point. And this force that's applied a distance away from the pivot point, or we could say from the axis of rotation, or the center of mass. That's called torque. And torque, the letter for torque is this Greek, I think that's tau, it's a curvy T. And torque is defined as force times distance. And what force and what distance is it? It's the force that's perpendicular to the object. I guess you could say to the distance vector. If this is the distance vector-- let me do it in a different color. If this is the distance vector, the component of the force is perpendicular to this distance vector. And this is torque. And so what are its units? Well, force is newtons, and distance is meters, so this is newton meters. And you're saying, hey Sal, newtons times meters, force times distance, that looks an awful lot like work. And it's very important to realize that this isn't work, and that's why we won't call this joules. Because in work, what are we doing? We are translating an object. If this is an object, and I'm applying a force, I'm taking the force over the distance in the same direction as the force. Here the distance and the force are parallel to each other. You could say the distance vector and the force vector are in the same direction. Of course, that's translational. The whole object is just moving. It's not rotating or anything. In the situation of torque, let me switch colors. The distance vector, this is the distance from the fulcrum or the pivot point of the center of mass, to where I'm applying the force. This distance vector is perpendicular to the force that's being applied. So torque and work are fundamentally two different things, even though their units are the same. And this is a little bit of notational. This distance is often called the moment arm distance. And I don't know where that came from. Maybe one of you all can write me a message saying where it did come from. And often in some of your physics classes they'll often call torque as a moment. But we'll deal with the term torque. And that's more fun, because eventually we can understand concepts like torque horsepower in cars. So let's do a little bit of math, hopefully I've given you a little bit of intuition. So let's say I had this ruler. And let's say that this is its pivot point right here. So it would rotate around that point. It's nailed to the wall or something. And let's say that I apply a force-- Let's say the moment arm distance. So let's say this distance, let me do it in different color. Let's say that this distance right here is 10 meters. And I were to apply a force of 5 newtons perpendicular to the distance vector, or to dimension of the moment arm, you could view it either way. So torque is pretty easy in this situation. Torque is going to be equal to the force, 5 newtons, times the distance, 10. So it would be 50 newton meters. And you're probably saying, well, Sal, how do I know if this torque is going to be positive or negative? And this is where there's just a general arbitrary convention in physics. And it's good to know. If you're rotating clockwise torque is negative. Let me go the other way. If you were rotating counterclockwise, like we were in this example, rotating counterclockwise, the opposite direction of which a clock would move in. Torque is positive. And if you rotate clockwise the other way, torque is negative. So clockwise is negative. And I'm not going to go into the whole cross product and the linear algebra of torque right now, because I think that's a little bit beyond the scope. But we'll do that once we do more mathematically intensive physics. But, so, good enough. There's a torque of 50 newton meters. And that's all of the torque that is acting on this object . So it's going to rotate in this direction. And we don't have the tools yet to figure out how quickly it will rotate. But we know it will rotate. And that's vaguely useful. But what if I said that the object is not rotating? And that I have another force acting here? And let's say that that force is-- I don't know, let me make up something, that's 5 meters to the left of the pivot point.  If I were tell you that this object does not rotate. So if I tell you that the object is not rotating, that means the net torque on this ruler must be 0, because it's not-- its rate of change of rotation is not changing. I should be a little exact. If I'm applying some force here, and still not rotating, then we know that the net torque on this object is 0. So what is the force being applied here? Well, what is the net torque? Well, it's this torque, which we already figured out. It's going in the clockwise direction. So it's 5-- Let me do it in a brighter color. 5 times 10. And then the net torque. The sum of all the torques have to be equal to 0. So what's this torque? So let's call this f. This is the force. So, plus-- Well, this force is acting in what direction? Clockwise or counterclockwise? Well, it's acting in the clockwise direction. This force wants to make the ruler rotate this way. So this is actually going to be a negative torque. So let's say, put a negative number here times f, times its moment arm distance, times 5, and all of this has to equal 0. The net torque is 0, because the object's rate of change of rotation isn't changing, or if it started off not rotating, it's still not rotating. So here we get 50 minus 5 f is equal to 0. That's 50 is equal to 5 f. f is equal to 10. If we follow the units all the way through, we would get that f is equal to 10 newtons. So that's interesting. I applied double the force at half the distance. And it offsetted half the force at twice the distance. And that should all connect, or start to connect, with what we talked about with mechanical advantage. You could view it the other way. Let's say these are people applying these forces. Say this guy over here is applying 10 newtons. He's much stronger. He's twice as strong as this guy over here. But because this guy is twice as far away from the pivot point, he balances the other guy. So you can kind of view it as this guy having some mechanical advantage or having a mechanical advantage of 2. And watch the mechanical advantage videos if that confuses you a little bit. But this is where to torque is useful. Because if an object's rate of rotation is not changing, you know that the net torque on that object is 0. And you can solve for the forces or the distances. I'm about to run out of time, so I will see you in the next video. ",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-system-of-particles-and-rotational-motion
" -  When humans communicate with one another, they tend to rely on a few things. So, first of all, we rely on language. We use it to communicate our ideas, thoughts and feelings, and also to respond to the ideas, thoughts and feelings of others. We also use a bunch of nonverbal cues, so we smile when we're happy, we frown when we're sad, we can tell if the people around us are anxious or angry. And we also use visual cues. So if I painted every room in my house black and blasted Metallica all day, I would be sending out different signals, different cues about myself, than if I was to paint every room in my house pink and cover everything in posters of ballerinas and unicorns. And other animals besides humans have ways of communicating as well. Maybe not with language per se, but with lots of different nonverbal cues and visual cues. As well as many other types of communication that aren't used by humans. And while we'll go over all of those different types of communications in a separate video, I wanted to take a little bit of time to talk about why animals communicate and why this is necessary. So one question we might want to ask is, ""Who are animals communicating with?"" So some species of animals might use different types of vocalization to communicate with members of the same species. But animals can also communicate with other animals that are not in their species. So, for example, some types of frogs use really bright colors to signal that they're toxic, which will let other animals know not to eat them. And of course, animals can also communicate with humans. Every morning my cats let me know when it's time for me to wake up and feed them. Or, at least, when they feel that I should wake up and feed them. But there's also autocommunication, so animals can also use communication to give information to themselves, and that's kind of a trickier one, but I think the best example might be bats and echolocation. So bats send out a signal, and then when that signal bounces back, they're able to gain information about the things in their environment. Alright, so animals can use communication to give information to themselves, to members of their same species, and also members of other species. But what type of information are these animals trying to convey? What is the main function of animal communication? Well, the first one would be mating rituals. Animals can produce a multitude of signals as a way to attract the opposite sex. Some are really brightly colors, others do complicated dances, and some do specific verbal calls. Animals also use communication to proclaim ownership or territory or to defend territory. So basically it's a way of telling other animals to back off. And I had birds as pets in my house when I was growing up, and my birds were extremely kind, they would sit on your shoulder, they would try to eat all of your food, and they were just generally really social. When they laid eggs, they got really territorial. They would basically try to take your finger off if you got too close to them. Another function of animal communication is food communication. So, signalling to other animals where they can find food. There's also alarm calls, or cases where animals will try to warn others about the presence of a predator. Animals can also use communication as a way to signal domice and submission. So, for example, after dogs fight, they might adapt different stances to indicate who came out on top. But one thing I want to make sure to say, before we actually go into really talking about all of the different ways that animals can use to communicate, is that I want to say that, while it's clear that animals do communicate, both which each other and with us as humans, we need to be really careful that we don't put too much thought into this. We need to be careful not to anthropomorphize, or attribute too many human characteristics to nonhuman animals. So we can try to interpret and try to ascribe meaning to the actions of animals, but we can never really be certain that we are correct, because we can't really ask the animals what they mean. So my cats sleep with me at night, and they usually sit with me when I'm on the couch, and I would like to assume that it's because they love me and want to be with me, but it's possible that they're also only trying to keep physical contact with me because I produce a lot of body heat. And that it is that motivation rather than love that explains my cats' behaviors.",science_ap-biology_ecology-ap
" In the last video, we saw that the quotient rule, which, once again, I have mixed feelings about because it really comes straight out of the product rule. If we have something in the form f of x over g of x, then the derivative of it could be this business right over here. So I thought I would at least do one example where we can apply that. And can could do it to find the derivative of something useful. So what's the derivative with respect to x-- let me write this a little bit neater-- the derivative with respect to x of tangent of x? And you might say, hey Sal, wait, I thought this was about the quotient rule. But you just have to remember, what is the definition of the tangent of x? Or what is one way to view the tangent of x? The tangent of x is the same thing as sine of x-- let me now color code it-- is the same thing as sine of x over cosine of x. And now it looks clear that our expression is the ratio or it's one function over another function. So now we can just apply the quotient rule. So all of this business is going to be equal to the derivative of sine of x times cosine of x. So what's the derivative of sine of x? Well, that's just cosine of x. So it's cosine of x is derivative of sine of x times whatever function we had in the denominator. So times cosine of x minus whatever function we had in the numerator, sine of x, times the derivative of whatever we have in the denominator. Well what's the derivative of cosine of x? Well the derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x. So we'll put the sine of x here. And it's a negative so I could just make this right over here a positive. And then all of that over, whatever was in the denominator squared, all of that over cosine of x squared. Now what does this simplify to? Well in the numerator right over here, we have cosine of x times cosine of x. So all of this simplifies to cosine squared of x. And sine of x times sine of x, that's just sine squared of x. And what's cosine squared of x plus sine squared of x? This is one of the most basic trigonometric identities. It comes straight out of the unit circle definition of trig functions. Let me write it over here. Cosine squared of x plus sine squared of x is equal to 1, which simplifies things quite nicely. So cosine squared of x plus sine squared of x, all of this entire numerator is equal to 1. So this nicely simplifies to 1 over cosine of x squared, which we could also write like this, cosine squared of x. These are two ways of writing cosine of x squared, which is the same exact thing as 1 over cosine of x squared, which is the same thing as secant. 1 over cosine of x is just secant of x. Secant of x squared, or we could write it like this. Secant squared of x. And so that's where it comes from. If you know that the derivative of sine of x is cosine of x and the derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x, we can use the quotient rule, which, once again, comes straight out of the product rule to find the derivative of tangent x is secant squared of x.",math_calculus-all-old_taking-derivatives-calc
" - Christine works in a movie store in her hometown. Using the store's total selection, she documented the price of each movie title and how many years it has been since it was featured in movie theatres. She plotted the points below. So let's see what's going on below here. Looks like there's two curves that she tries to fit. I'm assuming we're going to read about it in a second. But these blue points are the data points. So, for example, this data point right over here shows a movie that the title costs six dollars, and it has been released for almost two years, a little under two years. This data point right over here, this is a movie that has been released for almost four years, looks like maybe three and three quarters years. And they're selling that, looks like for a dollar or even a little bit less than a dollar. So those are her data points. So once, again, she documented the price of each movie title as a function of how many years it's been since it was featured in movie theatres. She is looking for a function that models her data. Since the trend of the data is decreasing and convex, and you see it here, it's definitely decreasing, and convex, it's opening upwards, if you imagine a curve, it looks like it's opening upwards a little bit like that, so decreasing and convex, she found a decreasing convex exponential model and a decreasing convex quadratic model. Which of the following functions better fits the data? Function A, this is an exponential. This is the one in green right over here. And Function B, this one right over here is a quadratic. And you can see this one in purple. And so, which one of those better fits the data? If we look at what's going on here, the green function, the exponential one, most of the data points for any given duration, for how long the title's been out, it looks like it's consistently underestimating. That it's always, the model's guess, or what the model would say the price is, is always, essentially except for only one data point right over here, for all of these other data points it's underestimating what the price would be. The purple model or the purple function right over here, it has more of a balance between overestimating, right over here, it's overestimating by a little bit, and underestimating. And its underestimates are closer, and its overestimates are closer than this green model. So I would say that Function B is definitely a better model. Use the function of best fit, so we're going to say Function B, to predict the price of a movie that was featured in theatres 5.5 years ago. Round your answer to the nearest cent. So 5.5 years ago, that's going to be right over here. We're going to go to Function B, which is this purple one. So it's going to be under a dollar. But we want to get something to the nearest cent, so let's actually use the actual definition of the function. So this is price as a function of how long the movie has been released. Where x is how long it's been released, and y is its price. If x is 5.5, let's figure out what y is going to be. So y is going to be equal to 0.5 times x squared. So x is 5.5 squared. So then we have minus five times x again. So minus five times 5.5. And then we have plus 13. And what does that get us? That gets us 62 1/2 cents. If we were to round our answer to the nearest cent, that's going to be 63 cents. And we got it right.",math_statistics-probability_advanced-regression-inference-transforming
" -  Naoya read a book cover to cover in a single session, at a rate of 55 pages per hour. 55 pages per hour. After reading for four hours, after reading for four hours, he had 330 pages left to read. How long is the book in pages and how long did it take Naoya to read the entire book? Well there's a bunch of ways that we could approach this. Like always, pause the video and try to figure it out. But I will go with one way first, and then maybe I'll tackle it another way. So one way is, let's just set up a little table here. And on one column, let's think about, let's think about how long Naoya has read in hours, so we'll just call that ""time."" ""T"" for time in hours. This is how long he has read, and in this column, this is how much he has left to read. So let's just write that ""L,"" left to read. And then this is going to be given in pages. This is going to be given in pages. So lets see, we don't know at zero hours, we don't know how many pages he has left to read, at, if we knew that, at zero hours, before he's read, the pages left to read, that's gonna be the entire book. So that would answer this question, ""How long is the book?"" So this is gonna be interesting. We don't know what happens at one hour, after two hours, after three hours. But they do tell us, that after reading for four hours, after reading for four hours, he had 330 pages left to read. So after four hours, he had 330 pages, 330 pages left to read. So, based on this, and the fact that he's reading at 55 pages per hour, can we back up to figure out all of this? Well remember, every hour that goes by, every hour that goes by, he has read 55 pages. So if he's read 55 pages, remember this 330, this isn't how many pages he's read, this is how many he has left to read. So after every hour he has 55 fewer pages to read. So at three hours, he should have 55 more pages to read. So this should be, at three hours, 330 plus 55 would be 385. Now let's see whether this makes sense. So when our change in time, this triangle is just the Greek letter Delta, means ""change in."" When our change in time is plus one, plus one hour, our change in pages left to read is going to be equal to negative 55 pages. And that makes sense, the pages left to read goes down every hour. We're measuring not how much he's read, we're measuring how much he has left to read. So that should go down by 55 pages every hour. Or if we were to go backwards through time, it should go up. So at two hours he should have 55 more pages to read. So what's 385 plus 55? We'll let's see, 385 plus 5 is 390, plus 50 is 440. So he'd have 440 pages, and all I did is I added 55. And then, after reading for one hour, he would have 55 more pages than after reading for two hours. So 440 plus 55 is 495. And then before he started reading, or right when he started reading, he would have had to read even 55 more pages, 'cause after one hour, he would have read those 55 pages. So 495 plus 55 is going to be, let's see, it's gonna be, add 5, you get to 500 plus another 50 is 550 pages. So at time equals zero had had 550 pages to read. So that's how long the book is. But how long does it take Naoya to read the entire book? Well we could keep going. We could say, ""Okay, at the fifth hour, ""this thing's gonna go down by 55."" So let's see, if this goes down by 50, if this goes down by 50, we're going to get to 280, but then you go down five more, it's gonna go to 275, and we could keep going on and on and on. Or we could just say, ""Look."" ""He's got 330 pages left to read, and he's gonna,"" Let's see, let me write this, let me write the units down. ""Pages, and he's reading at a rate of 55 pages per hour, ""pages per hour, this is the same thing, ""this is going to be equal to 330 pages ""times one over 55 hours per page."" I'm dividing by something, the same thing as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 55 pages per hours, if you divide by that, that's the same thing as multiplying by 1/55th of an hour per page, is one way to think about it. And so what do you get? The pages cancel out, pages divided by pages, and you have 330 divided by 55 hours. 330 divided by 55 hours. And what's that going to be? Let's see, 30 divided by 5 is 6, 300 divided by 50 is 6, so this is going to be equal to 6 hours. Now we have to be very careful, you might want to write six hours here, but this is six hours after this point. Six hours after that point. So in total, it's going to take him ten hours. At four hours, he had 330 pages left to read and then there was six more hours to finish those 330 pages. So it's gonna take a total of ten hours. And we could also see if this makes sense. If he reads 550 pages in ten hours, If he reads 550 pages in ten hours, in ten hours, what's his rate of reading? Well, 550 divided by 10, that's gonna be the same thing as 55 pages per hour. Which is consistent with what we just read, that he reads at 55 pages per hour. Now another way that you could have tackled this, you could say, ""Hey, this in gonna be ""a linear equation!"" If you're well versed with your linear equations you could say, ""Look, he's reading at a constant rate."" And if we're talking about, let's say, let me just set up a function here, we could say left to read, as a function of time, is going to be equal to, he's reading at a rate of 55 pages per hour, so the amount he's left to read is gonna go down by 55 pages per hour. So it's gonna go down 55, 55 pages every hour. So you could write it like that, plus it's whatever the initial number of pages were. Plus whatever the initial number of pages were. And then you could use this information right over here to solve for b. We know that when time is equal to four hours, we know that when, let me do it in that color. We know that when time is equal to four hours, that the pages left to read are 330. Pages left to read are 330, and so you get 330 is equal to, let's see, negative 55 times 4 is negative 220. Negative 220 plus, negative 220 plus b, plus b, and then if you add 220 to both sides, 220, add 220, to both sides, you're going to be left with, on this side, you're gonna get 550 is equal to, these cancel out, they add up to zero, is equal to b. And so the function that describes how much he has left to read, the amount he has left to read is a function of time, is, well he's reading 55 pages per hour, so the amount he has left to read's gonna go down every hour, that's why we have that negative there. So the negative 55 pages per hour, times the number of hours, plus 550. So if someone said, ""Well how long is the book?"" Well that's going to be L of zero. That's going to be how many pages he has left to read at time zero. And we see that L of zero is going to be 550. When T is equal to zero, let me write this down, L of zero is going to be equal to 550. When T is equal to zero, this term goes away and you just have 550 pages. And, just like that, we could have answered this question. And then you could say, ""Well look, if the book ""is 550 pages, and if he's reading at 55 pages per hour, ""how many hours is it gonna take?"" Well 550 pages divided by 55 pages per hour is going to get you 10 hours. And we could have done that here actually, now that I think about it. Instead of saying 330 pages divided by 55 pages per hour, and say ,""Hey, that's gonna take us ""six more hours from this point."" We already knew this, and we could have said, ""Look, if we have 550 pages to read, ""and we're reading at 55 pages per hour, ""it's gonna take us ten hours."" So you see, there's a ton of different ways to solve these problems. And they're all really, at the end of the day, representing the same thing. That's what's neat about mathematics. They're just ways of representing how to think about things, and at the end of the day we're really just thinking about the same problem, just representing it with different ways and different symbols.",math_algebra-home_alg-linear-eq-func
" -  We have, listed here... We know that carbon 12 is the most common isotope of carbon on Earth. 98.89% of the carbon on Earth in carbon 12. And we know that, by definition, its mass is exactly 12 atomic mass units. Now that's not the only isotope of carbon on Earth. There are other isotopes. The next most frequent one is carbon 13. 1.11% of the carbon on Earth is carbon 13. And we can experimentally find that its mass is 13.0034 atomic mass units. So, these numbers that we have here, just as a review, these are atomic mass. These are atomic mass. And so, what we're gonna think about, in this video, is how do they come up with the atomic weight number that they'll give you on a periodic table like that? So, atomic weight. Where does that come from? Well, in the video on atomic weight and on atomic mass, we see that the atomic weight is the weighted average of the atomic masses of the various isotopes of that element. So, to find this roughly 12.01, we take the weighted average of these two things. And what do we weight it by? We weight it by how common that isotope actually is. So, what we wanna do is, we could take 98.89% and multiply it by 12. And I'll rewrite this percentage as a decimal. So it'll be 0.9889 times 12. And, to that, we are going to add... We are going to add 1.11% times 13.0034. So, as a decimal, that's going to be 0.011. That's 1.11% is 0.011, oh, 111. And I'm gonna multiply that times 13.0034 atomic mass units. So, what does that give us? Let's get our calculator out here. So, we are going to have 0.9889 times 12 is equal to 11.8668. And, to that, we are going to add... We are going to add 0.0111 times 13.0034. And I know it's going to do this multiplication first because it's a calculator knows about order of operations. And so, that's all going to be, as you can see, 12.01113774, which, if you were to round to the hundredths place, is how this atomic weight was gotten. So that's that. There you go. That's how we calculate atomic weight. So, I can write this as approximately 12.01. It's the weighted average of the atomic masses. Now, another thing that you might want to note is, what's the difference between carbon 12 and carbon 13? Carbon 12, this right over here, is six protons. The six protons are what make it carbon, so both of these will have six protons. And the difference is in the neutrons. This right over here has six neutrons, six neutrons. And this, right over here, is gonna have one more neutron, seven neutrons. So, when you look at the difference in atomic mass, notice the change is... Looks like it's plus 1.0034 atomic mass units. So, from this, you can say, ""Hey, look, if I add a neutron... Plus one neutron. Plus one neutron. It's roughly equal to an atomic mass unit."" It's not exactly an atomic mass unit, but, roughly speaking, in a lot of very broad, high-level terms, you can kind of view it as being very close to one atomic mass unit. And the same thing is true of protons. Anyway, hopefully you now have an appreciation for the difference between atomic mass, which is the mass, and atomic weight, which is the weighted average of the various isotopes of that element on Earth, how to calculate it, and roughly what the mass of a neutron is.",science_chemistry_atomic-structure-and-properties
" What is the place value of 3 in 654.213? So let's think about that a little bit. And to do that, let me rewrite the number, and I'll write each digit in a different color. So we have 654 point-- we get the decimal point-- 213. Now we're pretty familiar, I think, with what goes on to the left of the decimal point. We know that this right here-- let me do this in a neutral color-- is the hundreds place, or we could view that as 10 to the second. Let me write that a little bit bigger down here. So this right here that is the hundreds place, or you could view that as the 10 to the second's place, which is the same thing as hundred. This right here is the tens place, which is the same thing as 10 to the first. This right here is the ones place, which is the same thing as 10 to the zero. Then if you go one place to the right of the decimal point, this represents tenths. This represents tenths, or we could view it as 10 to the negative one. Then, if we go to this magenta, if we go two places to the right, this represents hundredths, or 10 to the negative two. And then finally, this 3 represents thousandths. This represents thousandths, or 10 to the negative three. Now, just to answer the question what is the place value of 3 in 654.213? The place value is thousandths. That would essentially answer their question. But to make sure that we really understand what this means, I'm going to rewrite this number. We can rewrite this number as 600. We have 6 hundreds plus 5 tens, or you could say plus 50 plus 4 ones plus 2/10, plus 1/100, plus 3/1,000. Or we could write this, just to really make sure we understand what we're talking about when we mean place value, we can rewrite this number as 6 times 100, plus 5 times 10, plus 4 times 1-- I keep doing that in the wrong color-- plus 2 times 1/10, plus 1 times 1/100, and then finally, plus 3 times 1/1,000. So hopefully, when you write it out like this, it gives you a sense of what it means we say place value. The 6, three digits to the left of the decimal, is in the hundreds place, so it represents 6 hundreds. This represents 5 tens because it's in the tens place. This represents 4 ones. You go to the thousandths place, this 3 literally represents three one-thousandths.",math_in-in-class-6-math-india-icse_in-in-6-decimals-icse
" We're asked, how many inches are in 4 and 1/2 yards? And we'll do it a couple of ways. One, we could just say how many inches are in 4 yards and how many inches are in a 1/2 of a yard? And this really 4 plus 1/2 yards. Or we could convert this into an improper fraction first and then convert. But before I even do that, let's just think about how many inches there are in a yard. So if I have 1 yard, we know that there are 3 feet for every 1 yard, Right? And when you say, why am I multiplying by 3 instead of saying there's 1 yard for every 3 feet? And the easiest way to think about it is you're going to have a larger value over here, and you're also going to want to have these units right over here cancel out. So yard is canceling out with yard. So you have 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, which is kind of what we already knew. I'm just showing you how the dimensions cancel out. And how many inches are there per foot? Well, we know that there are 12 inches for every 1 foot. And same logic over here, inches is a smaller unit of measurement so it makes sense that we're multiplying by 12. 3 feet is going to be more inches, so we're multiplying by 12. And also these units cancel out-- foot in the numerator, foot in the denominator. 3 times 12 divided by 1 is equal to 36 inches. So you might have already known it. But this is nice to have the dimensions cancel out like this. We know that 1 yard is equal to 36 inches. Or there are 36 inches for every 1 yard. And so we can now either break this down, or we can turn this into an improper fraction. First I'll just break it down into 4 yards plus 1/2 yards. So we could say that this is 4 yards. So 4 yards is going to be equal to-- well, let's just multiply it times 36 inches, 36 inches for every 1 yard. The yards cancel out. 4 times 36 is 120, plus 24, so that's 144. So this is equal to 144 inches. That's just the 4 yards. And then if we do the 1/2 yards, so 1/2 of a-- I guess I say 1/2 yard, once again, times 36 inches per yard, the yards cancel out. 1/2 times 36 is going to be equal to 18 inches. So 4 and 1/2 yards is the same thing as 4 yards plus 1/2 yards, which is the same thing as 144 inches plus 18 inches, which is going to give us-- let's just add it up over here on the right, 144 plus 18. 4 plus 8 is 12. 4 plus 1 is 5. You have this 1 up here, so it's 6, and then we have a 1. So when you add them all together, you get 162 inches. The other way to do this would have been to convert this into an improper fraction and then multiply by the unit. So let's do it that way. If I have 4 and 1/2 of anything, really-- so let me write 4 and 1/2. I'm trying to find a suitable color. So if I have 4 and 1/2, this is the same thing-- 4 is the same thing as 8/2. This is the same thing-- so let me write it this way. 4 and 1/2 is the same thing as 4 plus 1/2, which is the same thing as-- if we want to have the same denominator as this 2 over here or as this 1/2 over here, this is the same thing as 8/2. Or you could say 4/1 is the same thing as 8/2, if we want to have a common denominator, so 8/2 plus 1/2. Actually, let me write it that way, just so you really understand what we're doing. 4 is the same thing as 4/1. So it's 4/1 plus 1/2. If we want to find a common denominator, it's 2. So 4/1 is the same thing as 8/2 plus 1/2, which is equal to 9/2. Now, I did it this way, which takes longer, just so you really understand how we converted it, why it makes-- hopefully conceptually why it just makes intuitive sense, why 4 and 1/2 is the same thing as 9/2. But if you want a simple process for it, you could just say, look, 4 times 2 is 8. 8 plus 1 is 9. And that gives you that 9 right over there, so 9/2. So we have 9/2 yards that we want to convert to inches. Same process-- times 36 inches per yard. Yard in the numerator, yard in the denominator. We are left with 9/2 times 36. We could say times 36/1 if we like, 36 Inches for every 1 yard. 36-- or the number 36 really is the same as 36/1. And then we're left with just inches in our units. We're just left with inches. And over here there's several ways that we can simplify it. Probably the easiest way to simplify it is we can divide both our numerator and our denominator by 2. So let me write it this way. I don't want to skip steps. So we have 9 times 36 over 2 times 1, or over 2 inches. And we can divide the numerator and the denominator by 2 to simplify it. They're both divisible by 2. 36 divided by 2 is 18. 2 divided by 2 is 1. So we're really just left with 9 times 18 inches. We can just multiply 9 times 18. Let me do it over here. 18 times 9. 8 times 9 is 72. 1 times 9 is 9, plus 7 is 16, so we get 162 inches. So all of this simplifies to 162 inches, and we are done.",math_5th-engage-ny_engage-5th-module-2
" Let's take 63 and divide it by 35. So the first thing that we might say is, OK, well, 35 doesn't go into 6. It does go into 63. It goes into 63 one time, because 2 times 35 is 70, so that's too big. So it goes one time. So let me write that. 1 times 35 is 35. And then if we were to subtract and we can regroup up here, we can take a 10 from the 60, so it becomes a 50, give that 10 to the 3, so it becomes a 13. 13 minus 5 is 8. 5 minus 3 is 2. So you could just say, hey, 63 divided by 35-- let me write this. You could say 63 divided by 35 is equal to 1 remainder 28. But this isn't so satisfying. We know that the real answer is going to be one point something, something, something. So what I want to do is keep dividing. I want to divide this thing completely and see what type of a decimal I actually get. And to do that, I essentially have to add a decimal here and then just keep bringing down decimal places to the right of the decimal. So 63 is the exact same thing as 63.0, and I could add as many zeroes as I might want to add here. So what we could do is we just make sure that this decimals right over there, and we can now bring down a zero from the tenths place right over here. And you bring down that zero, and now we ask ourselves, how many times does 35 go into 280? And, as always, this is a bit of an art when you're dividing a two-digit number into a three-digit number. So let's see, it's definitely going to be-- if I were to say-- so 40 goes into 280 seven times. 30 goes into 280 about nine times. It's going to be between 7 and 9, so let's try 8. So, let's see what 35 times 8 is. 35 times 8. 5 times 8 is 40, 3 times 8 is 24, plus 4 is 28. So it actually works out perfectly. So 35 goes into 280 exactly eight times. 8 times 5, we already figured it out. 8 times 35 is exactly 280, and we don't have any remainder now, so we don't have to bring down any more of these zeroes. So now we know exactly that 63 divided by 35 is equal to exactly 1.8.",math_6th-engage-ny_engage-6th-module-2
" I'm going to define a function S of n and I'm going to define it as the sum of all positive integers including N. And so the domain of this function is really all positive integers - N has to be a positive integer. And so we can try this out with a few things, we can take S of 3, this is going to be equal to 1 plus 2 plus 3, which is equal to 6. We could take S of 4, which is going to be 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4, which is going to be equal to 10. Now what I want to do in this video is prove to you that I can write this as a function of N, that the sum of all positive integers up to and including N is equal to n times n plus one, all of that over 2. And the way I'm going to prove it to you is by induction. Proof by induction. The way you do a proof by induction is first, you prove the base case. This is what we need to prove. We're going to first prove it for 1 - that will be our base case. And then we're going to do the induction step, which is essentially saying ""If we assume it works for some positive integer K"", then we can prove it's going to work for the next positive integer, for example K + 1. And the reason why this works is - Let's say that we prove both of these. So the base case we're going to prove it for 1. But it doesn't always have to be 1. Your statement might be true for everything above 55. Or everything above some threshold. But in this case, we are saying this is true for all positive integers. Our base case is going to be 1. Then in our induction step, we are going to prove that if you assume that this thing is true, for sum of k. If we assume that then it is going to be true for sum of k + 1. And the reason why this is all you have to do to prove this for all positive integers it's just imagine: Let's think about all of the positive integers right over here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 you could just keep going on forever. So we are going to prove it for 1. We are going to prove that this formula right over here, this expression right over here applies for the case of 1, when n is 1. And then we are going to prove that if we know it is true for any given k that is true for the next one So if we know it is true for 1 in our base case then the second step, this induction step must be true for 2 then. Because we proved generally if it's true for k it's going to be true for k + 1. When it's true for 2, then it must be true for 3, because we have proved it, when it's true for k, it's true for k + 1. So if it's true for 2 it's true for 3. and if it's true for 3 it's going to be true for 4. You can just keep going on and on forever, which means it's true for everything. Now spoken in generalaties let's actually prove this by induction. So let's take the sum of, let's do this function on 1. that is just going to be the sum of all positive integers including 1 is just literally going to be 1. We've just added all of them, it is just 1. There is no other positive integer up to and including 1. And now we can prove that this is the same thing as 1 times 1 plus 1 all of that over 2. 1 plus 1 is 2, 2 divided by 2 is 1, 1 times 1 is 1. So this formula right over here, this expression it worked for 1, so we have proved our base case. we have proven it for 1. Now what I want to do is I want to assume that it works for some number k. So I will assume true for some number k. So i'm going to assume that for some number k, that this function at k is going to be equal to k times k plus 1 over 2. So I'm just assuming this is true for that. Now what I want to do is think about what happens when I try to find this function for k + 1. This is what I'm assuming. I'm assuming I know this. Now let's try to do it for k + 1. So what is the sum of all of the integers up to and including k + 1? Well this is going to be 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus all the way up to k. Plus k plus 1. Right? this is the sum of everything up to and including k plus 1. Well we are assuming that we know what this already is. We are assuming that we already have a formula for this. We are assuming that this is going to simplify to k times k plus 1 over 2. We are assuming that we know that. So we will just take this part and we will add it to k plus 1. so we'll add it to k plus 1 over here. And if you find the common denominator, the common denominator is going to be 2. So this is going to be equal to... I'll write the part in magenta first. so this is k times k plus 1 over 2 plus 2 times k plus 1 over 2. This thing in blue is the same thing as that thing in blue. The 2's would cancel out, I'd just wrote it this way so I have a common denominator. So this is going to be equal to... We have a common denominator of 2 and I'll write this in a different colour here. So we are going to have k times k plus 1 plus 2 times k plus 1. Now at this step right over here you can factor out a k plus 1. Both of these terms are divisible by k + 1. So let's factor this out. So if you factor out a k + 1, you get k plus 1 times refractoring out over here, if you factor out k + 1 you'd just have a k. Over here if you factor out k + 1 you would just have a 2. Let me colour code those. So you would know what I'm doing. So this 2 is this 2 right over there and this k is this k right over there. We factored it out. These k+1's we factored out is this k+1 over there. And it's going to be all of this over 2. Now, we can rewrite this. This is the same thing. This is equal to. This is the same thing as k plus 1, that's this part right over here. Times k plus 1 plus 1. Right? This is clearly the same thing as k + 2. All of that over 2. Why is this interesting to us? Well we have just proven it. If we assume that this is true and if we use that assumption we get that the sum of all positive integers up to and including k + 1 is equal to k + 1 times k + 1 + 1 over 2. We are actually showing that the original formula applies to k+1 as well. If you would take k + 1 and put it in for n you got exactly the result that we got over here. So we showed , we proved our base case. This expression worked for the sum for all of positive integers up to and including 1. And it also works if we assume that it works for everything up to k. Or if we assume it works for integer k it also works for the integer k plus 1. And we are done. That is our proof by induction. That proves to us that it works for all positive integers. Why is that? We have proven it for 1 and we have proven it that if it works for some integer it will work for the next integer. So if you assume it worked for 1 then it can work for 2. Well we have already proven that it works for 1 so we can assume it works for 1. So it definitely will work for 2. So we get 2 checked. But since we can assume it works for 2 we can now assume it works for 3. Well if it works for 3 well then we have proven it works for 4. You see how this induction step is kinda like a domino, it cascades and we can go on and on forever so it works for all positive integers.",math_algebra-home_alg-series-and-induction
" Luis looked at the expression x minus y times x squared plus xy plus y squared, and wrote the following. He said, using the distributive property-- so he took x minus y and he distributed this expression onto the x and this expression onto the negative y. So that's why we have an x times this entire expression over here. x times the entire expression minus y times this entire expression. Then he says, using the distributive property again, this is equal to-- so then he distributed this x into that and got all of the first three terms here. He got these first three terms. And then he distributed the y. He distributed the y over here and he got these three terms. And then he saw, looks like that this term x squared y cancels out with a minus x squared y, and the xy squared cancels out with the negative xy squared. Then he saw that it equals x to the third minus y to the third. And he wrote down, I conjecture that x minus y times x squared plus xy plus y squared is equal to x to the third minus y to the third for all x and y. Did Carlos use inductive reasoning? Explain. Well, inductive reasoning is looking at a sample of things-- looking at some set of data, if you will-- and then making a generalization based on that. You're not 100% sure, but based on what you've seen so far, you think that the pattern would continue. Or you think it might be true for all things that have that type of property or whatever. Now in this situation, he didn't look at some type of a sample. He actually just did a proof. He multiplied this out algebraically. In fact, it's incorrect for him to say I conjecture here. A conjecture is a statement or proposition that is unproven, but it's probably going to be true. It's unproven but it seems reasonable, or it seems likely that it's true. This isn't a conjecture. This is proven. He proved that x minus y times x squared plus xy plus y squared is equal to x to the third minus y third. He should have written-- and this is a much stronger thing to say-- he should have said, I proved that this is true for all x and y. So to answer the question, did he use inductive reasoning? No. I would say that he made an outright proof. No, he made a proof. Inductive reasoning would have been, if he would have saw, if you would have given him 5 minus 2 is equal to-- or 5 minus 2 times 5 squared plus 5 times 2 plus 2 squared, and you saw that that was equal to the same thing as 5 to the third minus 2 to the third. And then let's say he did it for, I don't know, one in seven in a couple of examples. And it kept holding for all the examples that it was the first number cubed minus the second number cubed. Then it would have been inductive reasoning to say that that is true for all numbers x and y. But here it's not an induction. He didn't use induction. Or I shouldn't say induction. He didn't use inductive reasoning. He outright proved that this statement is true for all x and y.",math_algebra-home_alg-series-and-induction
" -  So we are asked to order the expressions from least to greatest and this is from the exercises on Khan Academy and if we're doing it on Kahn Academy, we would drag these little tiles around from least to greatest, least on the left, greatest on the right. I can't drag it around 'cause this is just a picture, so I'm gonna evaluate each of these, and then I'm gonna rewrite them from least to greatest. So let's start with two to the third minus two to the first. What is that going to be? Two to the third minus two to the first. And if you feel really confident, just pause this video and try to figure out the whole thing. Order them from least to greatest. Well two to the third, that is two times two times two, and then two to the first, well that's just two. So two times two is four, times two is eight, minus two, this is going to be equal to six. So this expression right over here could be evaluated as being equal to six. Now, what about this right over here? What is this equal to? Well let's see, we have two squared plus three to the zero. Two squared is two times two and anything to the zero power is going to be equal to one. It's an interesting thing to think about what zero to the zeroth power should be but that'll be a topic for another video. But here we have three to the zeroth power, which is clearly equal to one. And so we have two times two plus one. This is four plus one, which is equal to five. So the second tile is equal to five. And then three squared, well three squared, that's just three times three. Three times three is equal to nine. So if I were to order them from least to greatest, the smallest of these is two squared plus three to the zeroth power. That one is equal to five, so I'd put that on the left. Then we have this thing that's equal to six, two to the third power minus two to the first power. And then the largest value here is three squared. So we would put that tile, three squared. We will put that tile on the right, and we're done.",math_algebra-basics_basic-alg-foundations
" Let's do a few more examples from the orders of magnitude exercise. Earth is approximately 1 times 10 to the seventh meters in diameter. Which of the following could be Earth's diameter? So this is just an approximation. It's an estimate. And they're saying, which of these, if I wanted to estimate it, would be close or would be 1 times 10 to the seventh? And the key here is to realize that 1 times 10 to the seventh is the same thing as one followed by seven zeroes. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Let me put some commas here so we make it a little bit more readable. Or another way of talking about it is that it is, 1 times 10 to the seventh, is the same thing as 10 million. So which of these, if we were to really roughly estimate, we would go to 10 million. Well, this right over here is 1.271 million, or 1,271,543. If I were to really roughly estimate it, I might go to one million, but I'm not going to go to 10 million. So I'd rule that out. This is 12,715,430. If I were to roughly estimate this, well, yeah. I would go to 10 million. 10 million is if I wanted really just one digit to represent it, if I were write this in scientific notation. This right over here is 1.271543 times 10 to the seventh. Let me write that down. 12,715,430. If I were to write this in scientific notation as 1.271543 times 10 to the seventh. And when you write it this way, you say, hey, well, yeah, if I was to really estimate this and get pretty rough with it, and I just rounded this down, I would make this 1 times 10 to the seventh. So this really does look like our best choice. Now let me just verify. Well, this right over here, if I were to write it, I would go to 100 million, or 1 times 10 to the eighth. That's way too big. And this, if I were to write it, I would go to a billion, or 1 times 10 to the ninth. So that's also too big. So once again, this feels like the best answer. Now let's try a couple more. So here we're asked, how many times larger is 7 times 10 to the fifth than 1 times 10 to the fourth? Well, we could just divide to think about that. So 7 times 10 to the fifth divided by 1 times 10 to the fourth. Well, this is the same thing as 7 over 1 times 10 to the fifth over 10 to the fourth, which is just going to be equal to-- well, 7 divided by 1 is 7. And 10 to the fifth, that's multiplying five 10's. And then you're dividing by four 10's. You're going to have one 10 left over. Or, if you remember your exponent properties, this would be the same thing as 10 to the 5 minus 4 power, or 10 to the first power. So this right over here, all of this business, is going to simplify to 10 to the first, or I could actually write it this way. This would be the same thing as 10 to the 5 minus 4, which is equal to 10 to the 1, which is just equal to 10. So this is 7 times 10, which is equal to 70. So 7 times 10 to the fifth is 70 times larger than 1 times 10 to the fourth. Let's do one more. So here, they're asking us 3 times 10 to the ninth is 30,000 times larger than what number? So once again, we can divide. So we have 3 times 10 to the ninth is 30,000 times larger than what number? So let's just divide by 30,000 and see what we get. And here we've written something in kind of an exponential notation, or we should say scientific notation actually. And here, we just wrote the number out. So one way we could do it is we could either write this number out and then divide, or we could write this in scientific notation. So let's do it either way. So if we were to expand the top number out, we could write that as 3 followed by nine zeros. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Let me put some commas here to make it readable. And then we're dividing that by 3 followed by four zeros. One, two, three, four. And then we could cancel out the zeros. We could say, OK, let's divide the top and the bottom by 10. Let's divide it by another 10, by another 10, by another 10. And then, let's see, we've done all the dividing by 10. And now let's divide the top and the bottom by 3. So this would become a 1. This would become a 1. So on the bottom, we're just left with a 1. And we'd have 1 followed by one, two, three, four, five zeros. So this would be 1 followed by one, two, three, four, five zeros, or 100,000. Now let's write it, both of these, in scientific notation. So 3 times 10 to the ninth, I'm just going to rewrite that as 3 times 10 to the ninth. And we're dividing that by 30,000, which is the exact same thing as 3 times 10 to the-- we have one, two, three, four zeros here. 3 times 10 to the fourth. Or I guess I really should say, we have four places after the three. So one, two, three, four. So 3 times 10 to the fourth. And so we could divide the 3 by the 3, and then that will simplify. So 3 divided by 3 is just 1. And then 10 to the ninth divided by 10 to the fourth, well that's going to be 10 to the 9 minus 4, 10 to the fifth. So it's going to be 1 times 10 to the fifth, which, once again, is 1 followed by five zeros, or the exact same thing as 100,000. So it's 30,000 times larger than 100,000.",math_pre-algebra_pre-algebra-exponents-radicals
" -  We're told that Justin runs at a constant rate, traveling 17 kilometers in two hours. Write an equation that shows the relationship between the distance he runs, d, in kilometers and the time he spends running, h, in hours. So, pause this video and see if you can work through that on your own before we do it together. All right, now there's several ways to approach this question. One way is to say, look, he's running at a constant rate, so his distance is going to be equal to some constant, let's just call that lowercase k, times the amount of time he spends running, and the way that we can figure out what k is is by using the information that they gave us. They tell us right over here that when our distance is 17 kilometers, so when our distance is 17 kilometers, that's a situation where he has been running for two hours. So, that is going to be equal to k times two hours. So, what is k going to be? Pause the video again and see if you can figure it out, if you didn't figure it out the first time I asked you to pause the video. All right, well there's a bunch of ways to solve for k, but one way is to say, let's just divide both sides by two hours. So, if you divide both sides by two hours, you are going to get that k is going to be equal 17 over two kilometers per hour, which is, 17 over two is 8.5, 8.5 kilometers per hour. And so, if we go back to the original question, which asks us to write an equation that shows the relationship between d and h, we can say that d is equal to, we now know our proportionality constant, it is 8.5 times h. 8.5 times h, and we're done. If we wanted to write their units, we could write d is equal to 8.5 kilometers per hour times h, which is given in hours.",math_cc-seventh-grade-math_cc-7th-ratio-proportion
" Let's do some more percentage problems. Let's say that I start this year in my stock portfolio with $95.00. And I say that my portfolio grows by, let's say, 15%. How much do I have now? OK. I think you might be able to figure this out on your own, but of course we'll do some example problems, just in case it's a little confusing. So I'm starting with $95.00, and I'll get rid of the dollar sign. We know we're working with dollars. 95 dollars, right? And I'm going to earn, or I'm going to grow just because I was an excellent stock investor, that 95 dollars is going to grow by 15%. So to that 95 dollars, I'm going to add another 15% of 95. So we know we write 15% as a decimal, as 0.15, so 95 plus 0.15 of 95, so this is times 95-- that dot is just a times sign. It's not a decimal, it's a times, it's a little higher than a decimal-- So 95 plus 0.15 times 95 is what we have now, right? Because we started with 95 dollars, and then we made another 15% times what we started with. Hopefully that make sense. Another way to say it, the 95 dollars has grown by 15%. So let's just work this out. This is the same thing as 95 plus-- what's 0.15 times 95? Let's see. So let me do this, hopefully I'll have enough space here. 95 times 0.15-- I don't want to run out of space. Actually, let me do it up here, I think I'm about to run out of space-- 95 times 0.15. 5 times 5 is 25, 9 times 5 is 45 plus 2 is 47, 1 times 95 is 95, bring down the 5, 12, carry the 1, 15. And how many decimals do we have? 1, 2. 15.25. Actually, is that right? I think I made a mistake here. See 5 times 5 is 25. 5 times 9 is 45, plus 2 is 47. And we bring the 0 here, it's 95, 1 times 5, 1 times 9, then we add 5 plus 0 is 5, 7 plus 5 is 12-- oh. See? I made a mistake. It's 14.25, not 15.25. So I'll ask you an interesting question? How did I know that 15.25 was a mistake? Well, I did a reality check. I said, well, I know in my head that 15% of 100 is 15, so if 15% of 100 is 15, how can 15% of 95 be more than 15? I think that might have made sense. The bottom line is 95 is less than 100. So 15% of 95 had to be less than 15, so I knew my answer of 15.25 was wrong. And so it turns out that I actually made an addition error, and the answer is 14.25. So the answer is going to be 95 plus 15% of 95, which is the same thing as 95 plus 14.25, well, that equals what? 109.25. Notice how easy I made this for you to read, especially this 2 here. 109.25. So if I start off with $95.00 and my portfolio grows-- or the amount of money I have-- grows by 15%, I'll end up with $109.25. Let's do another problem. Let's say I start off with some amount of money, and after a year, let's says my portfolio grows 25%, and after growing 25%, I now have $100. How much did I originally have? Notice I'm not saying that the $100 is growing by 25%. I'm saying that I start with some amount of money, it grows by 25%, and I end up with $100 after it grew by 25%. To solve this one, we might have to break out a little bit of algebra. So let x equal what I start with. So just like the last problem, I start with x and it grows by 25%, so x plus 25% of x is equal to 100, and we know this 25% of x we can just rewrite as x plus 0.25 of x is equal to 100, and now actually we have a level-- actually this might be level 3 system, level 3 linear equation-- but the bottom line, we can just add the coefficients on the x. x is the same thing as 1x, right? So 1x plus 0.25x, well that's just the same thing as 1 plus 0.25, plus x-- we're just doing the distributive property in reverse-- equals 100. And what's 1 plus 0.25? That's easy, it's 1.25. So we say 1.25x is equal to 100. Not too hard. And after you do a lot of these problems, you're going to intuitively say, oh, if some number grows by 25%, and it becomes 100, that means that 1.25 times that number is equal to 100. And if this doesn't make sense, sit and think about it a little bit, maybe rewatch the video, and hopefully it'll, over time, start to make a lot of sense to you. This type of math is very very useful. I actually work at a hedge fund, and I'm doing this type of math in my head day and night. So 1.25 times x is equal to 100, so x would equal 100 divided by 1.25. I just realized you probably don't know what a hedge fund is. I invest in stocks for a living. Anyway, back to the math. So x is equal to 100 divided by 1.25. So let me make some space here, just because I used up too much space. Let me get rid of my little let x statement. Actually I think we know what x is and we know how we got to there. If you forgot how we got there, you can I guess rewatch the video. Let's see. Let me make the pen thin again, and go back to the orange color, OK. X equals 100 divided by 1.25, so we say 1.25 goes into 100.00-- I'm going to add a couple of 0's, I don't know how many I'm going to need, probably added too many-- if I move this decimal over two to the right, I need to move this one over two to the right. And I say how many times does 100 go into 100-- how many times does 125 go into 100? None. How many times does it go into 1000? It goes into it eight times. I happen to know that in my head, but you could do trial and error and think about it. 8 times-- if you want to think about it, 8 times 100 is 800, and then 8 times 25 is 200, so it becomes 1000. You could work out if you like, but I think I'm running out of time, so I'm going to do this fast. 8 times 125 is 1000. Remember this thing isn't here. 1000, so 1000 minus 1000 is 0, so you can bring down the 0. 125 goes into 0 zero times, and we just keep getting 0's. This is just a decimal division problem. So it turns out that if your portfolio grew by 25% and you ended up with $100.00 you started with $80.00. And that makes sense, because 25% is roughly 1/4, right? So if I started with $80.00 and I grow by 1/4, that means I grew by $20, because 25% of 80 is 20. So if I start with 80 and I grow by 20, that gets me to 100. Makes sense. So remember, all you have to say is, well, some number times 1.25-- because I'm growing it by 25%-- is equal to 100. Don't worry, if you're still confused, I'm going to add at least one more presentation on a couple of more examples like this.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-simple-linear-equations-in-one-variable-icse
" so now we have a very very very interesting problem on the left hand side of the scale I have two different types of unknown masses one of these X masses and we know that they have the same identical mass, we call that identical each of them having a mass of X But then we have this other blue thing and that has a mass of Y, which isn't necessarily going to be the same as the mass of X. We have two of these X's and a Y.It seems like the total mass or it definitely is the case, their total mass balance it out to these 8 kg right over here. Each of these is 1kg block and balances them out. So the first question I'm going to ask you is, can you express this Mathematically? Can you express what we're seeing here, the fact that this total mass balances out with this total mass. Can you express that mathematically? Well let's just think about our total mass on this side. We have two masses of mass X so those two are gonna total at 2X, and then you have a mass of Y. So then you're gonna have another Y. So the total mass on the left hand side. Alright let me re-write a little bit closer to the center. So,it doesn't get too spread out. On the left hand side, I got 2X plus a mass of Y. That's the total mass. The total mass on the left hand side is 2X plus Y, the total mass on the right hand side is just 8. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. It is equal to 8 And since we see that the scale is balance, this total mass must be equal to this total mass. So, we can write an equal sign there. Now my question to you is there anything we can do just based on the information that we have here to solve for either the mass X or for the mass Y. Is there anything that we can do. Well the simple answer is just with this information here, there's actually very little. You might say that ""Oh well, let me take the Y from both sides"" You might take this Y block up. But if you take this Y block up you have to take away Y from this side and you don't know what Y is. And if you think about it algebraically you might get rid of the Y here. Subtracting Y and you're gonna subtract Y from this side too. So, you're not gonna get rid of the Y. Same thing with the X's, you actually don't have enough information. Y depends on what X is,and X depends on what Y is. Lucky for us however,we do have some more of these blocks laying around. And what we do is we take one of these X blocks. And I stack it over here,and I also take one of the Y block and I stack it right over there. And then I keep adding all these ones until I balance these things out. So, I keep adding these ones. Obviously if I just place this, this will go down cause there's nothing on that side. But I keep adding these blocks until it all balances out and I find that my scale balances once I have 5 kg on the right hand side So, once again let me ask you this information having X and Y on the left hand side and a 5kg on the right hand side And the fact that they are balance, how can we represent that mathematically? Well our total mass on the left hand side is X plus Y. And our total mass, let me right that once again a little bit closer to the center. It's X plus Y on the left hand side and the right hand side I have 5 kg. I have 5kg. I have 5 kg on the right hand side. And we know that's actually balance the scale. So these total masses must be equal to each other. And this information by itself, once again. There's nothing I can do with it. I don't know what X and Y. If Y is 4 maybe X is 1 or maybe X is 4, Y is 1. Who knows what these are. The interesting thing is we can actually use both of these information to figure out what X and Y actually is. And I'm giving you a few seconds to think about how we can approach this situation. Well think about it this way, we know that X plus Y is equal to 5. So if we were to get rid of an X and a Y on this side,on the left hand side of the equation. What would we have to get rid of on the right hand side of the, or if we know if we get rid of X and Y on the left hand side of the scale What would we get rid of the right hand side of the scale to take away the same mass? Well if we take away the X and Y on the left hand side, we know that an X plus Y is 5kg. So, we'll just have to take 5kg from the right hand side. So, lets think about what that would do. Well then I'll just have an X over here, I'll just have some of these masses left over here.Then I would what X is. Now lets think about how we can represent that algebraically Essentially for taking an X and Y from the left hand side. If I'm taking an X and Y from the left hand side. I'm subtracting an X, and I'm subtracting an X. Actually let me think of it this way. I'm subtracting an X plus Y. I'm subtracting an X and Y on the left hand side. But then what am I gonna do on the right hand side? Well an X and a Y we know has a mass of 5. So we can subtract 5 from the right hand side. And the only way I'm gonna be able to do this is because of the information that we got from the second scale. So I can take away 5. So this is going to be equal to taking away 5. Taking away X and a Y is equal to taking away 5. And we know that because an X and a Y is equal to 5kg. And if we take away an X and a Y on the left hand side, what do we left with? Well this is gonna be the same thing. Let me rewrite this part. This, taking away an X and a Y is the same thing if you distribute the negative sign as taking away an X and taking away a Y. And so on the left hand side, we're left with just 2X and we have taken away one of the X's, we're left just an X. And we had a Y and we've took away one of the Y. So we're left with no Y. We see that visually, we're left with just an X here. And what do we have on the right hand side? We had 8 and we know X and Y is equal to 5, so we took away 5. So to keep the scale balance. And so 8 minus 5 is going to be 3. 8 minus 5 is equal to 3 and just like that using this extra information we're able to figure out that the mass of X is equal to 3. Now, one final question. We're able to figure out the mass of X, can you figure out what the mass of Y is. Well we can go back to either one of these scales. Probably be simpler to go back to this one. We know that the mass of X plus the mass of Y is equal to 5. So we could say, one thing we know that X is now is equal to 3. We know that this is now a 3kg mass. We can rewrite this is 3 plus Y is equal to 5 Well now we say, we could take 3 away from both sides. if I take 3 away from the left hand side I just have to take 3 away from the right hand side to keep my scale balanced. And I'll be left with the mass of Y is balance with a mass of 2 or Y is equal to 2. That's an analogy of taking 3 from both sides of this equation. And on the left hand side, I'm just left with a Y and on the right hand side I'm just left with a 2. So, X is equal to 3kg and Y is equal to 2kg and what I encouraged you to do is verify that it made sense right up here. Figure out what the total mass on the left hand and the right hand or verify what the total mass right over here really was 8 to begin with. And you'll see that 2Xs are gonna be 6kg plus my Y is 2kg that will balance 8kg. And 3 plus 2 was equal to 5.",math_math1_systems
" - All right, so we have Ying Ying had run a total of 30 laps for Running Class, or Running Club, I should say. So Ying Ying ran a total of 30 laps. Then, Ying Ying ran four more laps before school. So she ran four more laps before school. Three more laps at lunch, three more laps at lunch. And two more laps at recess. Ying Ying's doing a lot of running. Two more laps at recess. So what I want to do is, I want to figure out the total number of laps that Ying Ying ran, and I'm going to do it using a number line. So let's draw a number line here. Let's draw a number line. And Ying Ying starts at 30 laps. She had run 30 laps, and then she keeps running more laps than that. So my number line, I could start it wherever I want, but it might be convenient to start it at 30. And obviously I could do it at 29, and then I could go 30, actually let me just keep going up from there. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, a few more left. 36, 37, 38, 39, and let's say 40. And I could go all the way to 41. That's how much space I have. So let's see. Ying Ying started at 30 laps. So she started at 30 laps for Running Club. Then she ran, Ying Ying ran four more laps before school. So on the number line, if I go four more, that's going to be to the right. I'm going to be increasing by four. So I'm going to be increasing by one, two, three, four. So those four laps before school take us from 30 to 34. Then she runs three more laps at lunch. So then from 34, she's gonna go one, two, three to 37. She's gonna go to 37. So that's what those three more laps at lunch do for us. And then two more laps at recess. So she was at 37, and now we're gonna go one, two, to 39. So how many total laps does Ying Ying run? Well, Ying Ying runs a total of 39 laps. 39 laps, and we were able to figure it out using this number line. Now let's do an exercise very similar to this that you might see on Khan Academy. So this one right over here. Let me get rid of the stuff about Ying Ying so we don't get confused. So this says, and it's a little bit smaller but hopefully you can see what it says. A red ant army started with 100 marching ants. So we're gonna start with 100. And actually they tell us, well let me just read the whole thing. They started with 100 marching ants. Then the red army lost three ants down a hole. So actually let me, so lost three ants down a hole. Three ants were eaten by a bird. That's unfortunate. And one ant just blew away. I guess ants are fairly light creatures, so that makes sense. One ant blew away. Which number line shows how to find how many ants the red army has left? Well, the army started with 100 marching ants. We underlined that over here, so we need to start with 100. We need to start with 100. This one starts with 10. So I can immediately rule this one out. And so we could just select that one, but let's just make sure it makes sense. So we start with 100, and then we lose three ants down a hole. So we're gonna go down. Remember, we're losing ants, so we're gonna go to the left of the number line. We're gonna go to lower values. We're gonna go down one, two, three. So these are the three ants we lose down a hole. So three down the hole. Then we have three that were eaten by a bird, so you're gonna lose three more. That's those three right over there. It goes to 94 ants left. And then we have the one ant that gets blown away. So that gets us down to 93 ants left. So the red army, or the red ant army, has 93 ants left. 93 ants left. And we are done.",math_cc-2nd-grade-math_cc-2nd-add-subtract-100

" The amount of rain that falls in various cities in France varies. The line plot below shows the average monthly rainfall in 13 different cities. Measurements are rounded to the nearest 1/4 of a centimeter. How much more rain falls in the rainiest city than the second rainiest city? So let's make sure we understand what they're calling a line plot right over here. Each of these dots represents one of the cities whose average monthly rainfall was measured. And so, for example, putting this dot here shows that this is the only city that had 6 centimeters of average monthly rainfall. Here, this shows that there were two cities that had an average monthly rainfall of-- looks like 8 and 3/4 centimeters. There are two cities that had an average monthly rainfall of 12 and 3/4 centimeters. So at any given amount of rainfall, it's essentially showing you how many cities had that amount of rainfall on average per month. Now that we understand this diagram, let's answer the question. How much more rain falls in the rainiest city? So the rainiest city here, well, there's only one city that's up here at 13 and 1/2 centimeters of rainfall. So this right over here, let me mark this off. This is 13 and 1/2 centimeters. How much more rain falls in the rainiest city than in the second rainiest city? Well, this is the second rainiest city, is this city right over here. This is 13 and 1/4 centimeter. So the difference between the two is just one notch here. It's just one notch, going from 13 and 1/4 to 13 and 1/2, so one notch right over here. We see that there's four notches per centimeter. One notch over here is 1/4 of a centimeter. So just looking at it, you could say that the difference is 1/4 of a centimeter. Now, if it wasn't so clear, because here we're just looking one notch right over here, you could take the larger of the two and subtract from that the smaller of the two. So you could take 13 and 1/2, and from that, subtract 13 and 1/4. And there's multiple ways of doing this. You could subtract the 13 from the 13, and then subtract the 1/4 from the 1/2, and then you would get 1/4. Another way is you could convert these both into improper fractions. So 13 and 1/2 is the same thing as 2 times 13 is 26 plus 1 is 27. So that's 27/2. And then we could say minus-- let's see, 4 times 13 is 52, plus 1 is 53, so minus 53/4. And then in order to do the subtraction, you have to have the same denominator. And so 4 is a multiple of 2, so we just have to multiply the numerator and denominator here by 2. So we have 54/4 minus 53/4, which is equal to-- well, 54 minus 53 is 1, over 4-- 1/4 of a centimeter. For this problem, this would clearly be a little bit too much that you would have to do. But this is useful to know just in case it wasn't as obvious that these weren't just next to each other.",math_5th-grade-foundations-engageny_5th-m4-engage-ny-foundations
" So we have got a very interesting scenario here. I have this conical thimble-like cup that is 4 centimeters high. And also, the diameter of the top of the cup is also 4 centimeters. And I'm pouring water into this cup right now. And I'm pouring the water at a rate of 1 cubic centimeter. 1 cubic centimeter per second. And right at this moment, there is a height of 2 centimeters of water in the cup right now. So the height right now from the bottom of the cup to this point right over here is 2 centimeters. So my question to you is, at what rate-- we know the rate at which the water is flowing into the cup, we're being given a volume per time. My question to you is right at this moment, right when we are filling our cup at 1 cubic centimeter per second. And we have exactly 2 centimeters of water in the cup, 2 centimeters deep of water in the cup, what is the rate at which the height of the water is changing? What is the rate at which this height right over here is actually changing? We know it's 2 centimeters, but how fast is it changing? Well let's think about this a little bit. What are we being given? We're given-- we are being given the rate at which the volume of the water is changing with respect to time. So let's write that down. We are being given the rate at which the volume of the water is changing with respect to time, and we're told that this is 1 cubic centimeter per second. And what are we trying to figure out? Well we're trying to figure out how fast the height of the water is changing with respect to time. We know that the height right now is 2 centimeters. But what we want to figure out is the rate at which the height is changing with respect to time. If we can figure out this, then we have essentially answered the question. So one way that we can do this is we can come up with the relationship between the volume at any moment in time and the height at any moment in time. And then maybe take the derivative of that relationship, possibly using the chain rule, to come up with a relationship between the rate at which the volume is changing and the rate at which the height is changing. So let's try to do it step by step. So first of all, can we come up with a relationship between the volume and the height at any given moment? Well we have also been given the formula for the volume of a cone right over here. The volume of a cone is 1/3 times the area of the base of the cone, times the height. And we won't prove it here, although we could prove it later on. Especially when we start doing solids of revolutions within in integral calculus. But we'll just take it on faith right now, that this is how we can figure out the volume of a cone. So given this can we figure out volume-- can we figure out an expression that relates volume to the height of the cone? Well we could say that volume-- and I'll do it in this blue color-- the volume of water is what we really care about. The volume of water is going to be equal to 1/3 times the area of the surface of the water-- area of water surface-- times our height of the water. So times h. So how can we figure out the area of the water surface, preferably in terms of h? Well we see right over here, the diameter across the top of the cone is 4 centimeters. And the height of the whole cup is 4 centimeters. And so that ratio is going to be true of any-- at any depth of water. It's always going to have the same ratio between the diameter across the top and the height. Because these are lines right over here. So at any given point, the ratio between this and this is going to be the same. So at any given point, the diameter across the surface of the water-- if the depth is h, the diameter across the surface of the water is also going to be h. And so from that we can figure out what are the radius is going to be. The radius is going to be h over 2. And so the area of the water surface is going to be pi r squared, pi times the radius squared. h over 2 squared. That's the area of the surface of the water. And of course we still have the 1/3 out here. And we're still multiplying by this h over here. So let me see if I can simplify this. So this gives us 1/3 times pi h squared over 4 times another h, which is equal to-- we have pi, h to the third power over 12. So that is our volume. Now what we want to do is relate the volume, how fast the volume is changing with respect to time, and how fast the height is changing with respect to time. So we care with respect to time, since we care so much about what's happening with respect to time, let's take the derivative of both sides of this equation with respect to time. To do that, and just so I have enough space to do that, let me move this over. Let me move this over to the right a little bit. So I just move this over to the right. And so now we can take the derivative with respect to time of both sides of this business. So the derivative with respect to time of our volume and the derivative with respect to time of this business. Well the derivative with respect to time of our volume, we could just rewrite that as dV dt, this thing right over here. This is dV dt, and this is going to be equal to-- well we could take the constants out of this-- this is going to be equal to pi over 12 times the derivative with respect to t of h, of h to the third power. And just so that the next few things I do will appear a little bit clearer, we're assuming that height is a function of time. In fact, it's definitely a function of time. As time goes on, the height will change. Because we're pouring more and more water here. So instead of just writing h to the third power, which I could write over here, let me write h of t to the third power. Just to make it clear that this is a function of t. h of t to the third power. Now what is the derivative with respect to t, of h of t to the third power. Now, you might be getting a tingling feeling that the chain rule might be applicable here. So let's think about the chain rule. The chain rule tells us-- let me rewrite everything else. dV with respect to t, is going to be equal to pi over 12, times the derivative of this with respect to t. If we want to take the derivative of this with respect to t, we have something to the third power. So we want to take the derivative of something to the third power with respect to something. So that's going to be-- let me write this in a different color, maybe in orange-- so that's going to be 3 times our something squared, times the derivative of that something, with respect to t. Times dh-- I've already used that pink-- times dh dt. Let's just be very clear. This orange term right over here-- and I'm just using the chain rule-- this is the derivative of h of t to the third power with respect to h of t. And then we're going to multiply that times the derivative of h of t with respect to t. And then that gives us the derivative of this entire thing, h of t to the third power, with respect to t. This will give us the derivative of h of t to the third power with respect to d with respect to t, which is exactly what we want to do when we apply this operator. How fast is this changing? How is this changing with respect to time? So we can just rewrite this, just so gets a little bit cleaner. Let me rewrite everything I've done. So we've got dV, the rate at which our volume is changing with respect to time. The rate at which our volume is changing with respect to time is equal to pi over 12 times 3 h of t squared, or I could just write that as 3h squared, times the rate at which the height is changing with respect to time, times dh dt. And you might be a little confused. You might have been tempted to take the derivative over here with respect to h. But remember, we're thinking about how things are changing with respect to time. So we're assuming-- we did express volume as a function of height-- but we're saying that height itself is a function of time. So we're taking the derivative of everything with respect to time. So that's why the chain rule came into play when we were taking the derivative of h, or the derivative of h of t, because we're assuming that h is a function of time. Now what does this thing right over here get us? Well we're telling us at the exact moment that we set up this problem, we know what dV dt is, we know that it's 1 centimeter cubed per second. We know that this right over here is 1 centimeter cubed per second. We know what our height is right at this moment. We were told it is 2 centimeters. So the only unknown we have over here is the rate at which our height is changing with respect to time. Which is exactly what we needed to figure out in the first place. So we just have to solve for that. So we get 1 cubic centimeter-- let me make it clear-- we get 1 cubic centimeter per second-- 1I won't write the units to save some space-- is 1equal to pi over 2. 1And I'll write this in a neutral color. 1Actually, let me write in the same color. 1Is equal to pi over 2, times 3, times h squared. 1h is 2 so you're going to get 4 squared centimeters if we 1kept the units. 1So 3 times 4. 1All right let me be careful, that wasn't 1pi over 2, that was pi over 12. 1This is a pi over 12 right over here. 1So you get pi over 12, times 3 times 2 squared, times dh dt. 1All of this is equal to 1. 1So now I'll switch to a neutral color. 1We get 1 is equal to, well 3 times 4 is 12, 1cancels out with that 12. 1We get one is equal to pi times dh dt. 1To solve for dh dt divide both sides by pi. 1And we get our drum roll now. 1The rate at which our height is changing with respect 1to time as we're putting 1 cubic centimeter of water per second 1in. 1And right when our height is 2 centimeters high, 1the rate at which this height is changing with respect to time 1is 1 over pi. 1And I haven't done the dimensional analysis 1but this is going to be in centimeters per second. 1You can work through the dimensional analysis 1if you like by putting in the dimensions right over here. 1But there you have it. 1That's how fast our height is going 1to be changing at exactly that moment.",math_ap-calculus-ab_ab-diff-contextual-applications-new
" Let's review a little bit about what we know so far about subtraction. So if I say 5 minus 3, what does that mean? Well, there's a couple of ways to think about it. I could have 5-- let's say I had to 5 berries. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So I could have 5 berries, and when I say minus 3 you're subtracting 3 from it. I can view that as saying I'm going to take away 3 of these berries. So if I take away that berry, that berry, and that berry. So I took away 1, 2, 3 berries. How many berries do I have left? Well the only berries I have left are right here-- 1, 2. So I have 2 berries left just like that. Now the other way, the other way that I could visualize or think about 5 minus 3, I'll do it over here. 5 minus 3-- is to think about what the difference between 5 and 3 is. So let me draw this. So let's say I have 5 berries. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And let's say that you have 3 berries. Here's a slightly different color. You have 3 berries. So another way to think about 5 minus 3 is how many more berries do I have than you have? And if you look right here, well, you see, this berry is another-- you have also one berry there. We both have one berry there, we both have one berry there. But I've got 1, 2 berries that you don't have. So once again, I have 2 more berries than you have. Now we can also think of this from the number line point of view. So let me draw a number line just like that. It's my number line. We've learned on the addition videos we can keep going off forever. And actually, we could even go to the left of 0 and go into negative numbers, which we'll see in future videos. But I'll start at 0. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-- I'll just go up to 7. So if we do 5 minus 3, if we view 3 as being taken away from 5, 5 minus 3 means start at 5. If I did 5 plus 3 I would jump 3 spots to the right because that's increasing the number of things I have. But since I'm subtracting 3, I want to decrease by 3. So I decrease by 1, 2, 3 and I get to 2 just like that. Now if we visualize it from this point of view, let me draw another number line. I want to show you. I mean this is, I'm taking away 3 and here I'm saying, how many more is 5 than 3? Even though they're the exact same answer, but there are two different ways to think about it. Let me draw a number line here again. Let me draw the same number line. I have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So if I were to plot where 5 is on this number line, so this is the 5 right there. I'll put a little pink square around it. 5 is right there. Now 3, let me do 3 in this yellow color. 3 is right here on the number line. So in this way of thinking about 5 minus 3 you're saying, what is the difference-- let me write that down. Here we're saying, what is the difference between 5 and 3? And to figure out the difference you actually have to say, how much do you have to add to 3 to get to 5? So the difference here, how different is 5 than 3? Well you have to go up 1 and then up 2 to get to 5. So the difference between 5, which is all the way over here, and 3, which is just that far, is 2, just like that. That right there is 2. Let me draw that in another box. So that's 2 right here. I want to make this difference between subtraction and difference-- I want to make it at least reasonably clear to you because these are two different ways of viewing subtraction, but it ends up being the exact same operation. You're going to get the same answer regardless of which way you think about it. Now, I could view-- let me do different numbers now. Let me do 7 minus 4. So I could view this as, maybe I have a 7 foot long piece of wood. It's 7 feet long. If I put a ruler up against it I would have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So I have a 7 foot long piece of wood. And then I could saw off 4 of those feet. So if I were to saw off 4 of these feet-- so I saw off 1, 2, 3, 4. How much wood do I have left? So all of this stuff right here, I'm eliminating. I'm sawing it off. I'm sawing it off of the wood. Maybe I should do that in a darker color to show that I'm sawing it off. So all of this stuff is going to disappear. I'm grinding it away. I'm sawing that off. So I'm just left with-- after I saw the 4 inches or feet or whatever of the wood, I'm left with 1, 2, 3 inches of wood. So this is 3. So 7 minus 4 is equal to 3. This is viewing subtraction as literally taking away. I sawed off the wood, so I took away wood. Now I could think of it in a slightly different way of thinking about it, but give you the exact same answer. We could say 7 minus 4. So once again, I could have the 7 inch long piece of wood like that. So if I put a ruler here that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So once again, a 7 inch long piece of wood. And now instead of taking 4 away of it I'm comparing it-- so that's a 7-- I'm comparing it to a 4 inch long piece of wood. So I have another 4 inch long piece of wood right there. That's my 4 inch long piece of wood. that's 7, this is 4. You could view 7 minus 4 as taking 4 inches away from the long piece of wood. Or you could view seven minus 4 as the difference between the 4 inch piece of wood and the 7 inch piece of wood. So in this case, what's the difference? To go from the 4 inch piece of wood to the 7 inch piece of wood I would have to grow by 3 inches, or I would have to add a 3 inch piece of wood somehow. Or the wood would somehow have to grow by 3 inches in order to become 7 inches. So these are 2 completely equivalent ways to view subtraction. That's all a little bit of a review from the last video. Now what I also want to do in this video is start tackling slightly larger problems. But you'll see that really, the number line applies just equally as well as to kind of the simpler problems that we've done before. Let's do 17 minus 9. So just like everything else, there's two ways we could've done it. You know, the more slow way is you could draw 17 objects. Let's say I have 17 chips. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. And I'm going to take away 9 of them. So I'm going to take away 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. How many am I left with? I'm left with 1, 2, 3, 4 5, 6, 7, 8. So 17 minus 9 is equal to 8. But that took a long time and you could imagine, if this number was a lot bigger it would've taken me forever to draw all of these circles and then scratch out things. And it would've wasted paper and time. And we have other things to do. So another way you could do it, and maybe this would be easier for you to visualize, is to draw the number line. You always don't have to start at 0. So if we draw the number line, if we say that's 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7-- you could imagine, I could keep going to the left all the way to 0. But I start at 17. I could start at 17 and take away 9 from it. So I go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. And once again, we are left at 8. Now this was, at least in my head, a little bit cleaner and faster than this one. But in either case, you don't want to do this every time you have to subtract 9 from 17 or want to find the difference between 17 and 9. And then to realize that's 8. So this is something that eventually you want to internalize. You'll want to know by heart that, oh, 17 minus 9? I know that is 8. And by the way, 17 minus 8? What's 17 minus 8? Well, that is 9. And now why does all of this make sense? Because 8 plus 9 is equal to 17. So 17 minus 9 is 8. Or 17 minus 8 is 9. When I say 17 minus 8, I'm essentially saying that is equal to some number that if I were to add to 8 will equal 17. Well, that's 9. When I say 17 minus 9 that's saying, there's some number, that if I were to add it to 9, I'll get 17. And that's 8. So all of these, all of these statements, are kind of saying the same thing. That 8 plus 9 are 17. Or the difference between 17 and 9 is 8. Or the difference between 17 and 8 is 9. 1Hopefully I'm not confusing you. 1So for most of these subtraction problems where the 1answer is a one-digit answer, you should eventually have them 1memorized, but in your head it's good to be imagining 1this number line. 1Let's do a couple more of these. 1And then, once we have these memorized or at least be able 1to do a number line if we forget, I'll show you have to 1do any subtraction problem, arbitrarily for super 1large numbers. 1So let's say we're going to do 13 minus 5. 1So once again, I'm not going to do the whole circles 1or the berries this time. 1I'm just going to draw the number line. 1Just draw the number line like that. 1Let's start at 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5-- and you 1just can keep going lower and lower. 1You can go to 0 or you can even go past 0. 1We'll talk about that in the future. 1But we start at 13. 1We're starting at 13. 1And we're going to take 5 away from it. 1So this is the subtraction view of subtraction; 1we're taking away. 11, 2, 3, 4, 5 and we land at 8. 1So 13 minus 5-- let me do this in a new color. 113 minus 5 is equal to 8. 1Now another way we could have thought about that, 1I plotted where 13 is. 1I can plot where 5 is. 1I could say look, this is 5. 15 is right here on my number line. 1What do I have to add to 5 to get to 13? 1So let's see. 1I would have to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1I have to add 8 to 5 to get to 13. 15 plus 8 is equal to 13. 1So that tells me that 13 minus 5 is equal to 8. 1This also tells me that 13 minus 8 is equal to 5. 1All of these, are on some level, telling me the 1exact same thing. 1But the difference between 13 and 5 is 8. 1The difference between 13 and 8 is 5. 15 plus 8 is 13. 1So hopefully you have the hang of that and if you haven't done 1so already, it'll be good to practice all of these. 1Taking a teen number and then subtracting any of the 1one-digit numbers from those teen numbers. 1That's in general, very, very good practice for you.",math_arithmetic-home_addition-subtraction
" Graph x is less than 4. So let's draw ourselves a number line over here. So let me draw a number line. I'll start here at 0, so 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And we could go below 0. We'd have negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4. I could keep going. Now, we want to graph all of the x's that are less than 4, but we're not including 4. It's not less than or equal to 4. It's just less than 4. And to show that we're not going to include 4, what we're going to do is we're going to draw a circle around 4. So this shows us that we're not including 4. If we were including 4, I would make that a solid dot. And to show that we're going to do all the values less than 4, we want to shade in the number line below 4, going down from 4, just like that. And then we can just shade in the arrow just like that. So this right here is all of the values less than 4. And you could test it out. Take any value where there's blue. So there's blue over here, negative 2. Negative 2 is definitely less than 4. If you take this value right here, this 2, it's definitely less than 4. 4 is not included because 4 is not less than 4. It's equal to 4. 5 is not included because 5 is not less than 4.",math_cc-sixth-grade-math_cc-6th-equations-and-inequalities
" I'm going to tell you about a number that's cooler than pi, more mysterious than the golden ratio, weirder than e or i. Somehow in recent times, we seem to have forgotten about just how incredible this number is, yet many ancient cultures knew of it. Some even worshipped it. It was known to Pythagoras, Ptolemy, and Zeno of Elea. It was independently discovered in East Asia and there's even evidence that the Aztecs were aware of it. It's pretty different from most other numbers you've heard of, but today's mathematicians are becoming increasingly fascinated by this ancient concept. And I want to bring back into the common knowledge how cool, how amazing, this number really is. A fitting name for this number is the obsolete Greek letter digamma, which originally represented a w sound was called wau. Trying to write wau in decimal notation is, I think, a misleading exercise, which distracts from the nature of the number itself. One difficulty is that there's actually more than one way to represent it as an infinite decimal. But wau can be defined in some unconventional ways. Take this unusual fractal fraction. How would you find out what this equals? Let's see if it converges to something. If you had just one layer, it would be 2 over 4 or 1/2. Take two layers and it's 3/4 plus 1/4, that's 4/4. So this is 2 over 1, or just 2. Add another layer, that's 3 over 1 plus 1 over 1, 2 over 4 again. And for any finite number of layers, it will be one of those. But it turns out if you continue this fraction on to infinity you get neither 2 over 1, nor 1 over 2, but the curious number wau. Here's another way to write wau. Wau equals 5/6 plus all over 6, 5/6 plus all over 6 5/6 plus all over 6, 5/6, and so on. This infinite fractal quality of wau lets you do some really crazy stuff. Take this. Wau to the wau to the wau to do way, but this is wau times wau. It's all wau times wau-- I don't even know how to pronounce this, but infinite fractal exponentiation of wau loops back and equals wau. I mean, that's just wau. And wau does have an intimate relationship with other special numbers. Check this out. Wau to the pi, to the wau to the 2 pi, to the wau to the 4 pi, to the wau to the 8 pi, and so on, equals wau times square root wau, times cube root wau times, and so on. I mean, this isn't much more mind boggling than thinking about what might happen if you try to raise a number to an imaginary power. Speaking of which e to the 2 i pi equals wau. Relatedly, you can find wau in calculus. The derivative of e to the wau equals wau e. And e to i, to the e i o is e to the wau to the tau wau wau. You might be tempted to try and solve these things using logarithms, but when you try to take log base wau, it kind of doesn't work. It's like dividing by 0. Cool, right? People talk about the geometry of the golden ratio as a bit special, but it's actually pretty normal. Normal numbers you can make a rectangle with that proportion just fine. Make the proportion wau, and well, you get something that most people wouldn't call a rectangle unless you're a mathematician and being technical. But if x and y are the size of a wau rectangle, meaning if x over y is wau, then x plus x to the y, over y plus y to the x, equals wau. And now if I take the previous two, x to the x to the y, and down here, y to the y to the x. This equals wau. And if I make the next term take just the previous two, x to the y to x to the x the y, and y to x to the y to the y to the x. This also equals wau. And you can keep going and get these non repeating patterns related to the Fibonacci sequence. And this will all work out to wau for any numbers x and y, where x over y is wau. Yeah, wau is awesome. You can make an equiangular spiral when you make the angle phi as you go around and get a golden spiral, pretty straightforward. But wau is such a weird number, if you try and make the angle wau, then the spiral curls up infinitely on itself, collapsing and entangling like a quantum string. Wau, in fact, shows up in physics, too. E to the wau divided by m c squares equals wau squared. And wau shows up everywhere in nature. I mean everywhere, every single flower or tree you see embodies wau. But instead of going on about that, I'll just give you one more crazy concept. Just imagine that you took a number to the power of a number to the power of a number all the way to infinity and then beyond infinity, so far that it came back down and became the number's root of the number's root of the number's root of, all the way past infinity until it gets back around to the beginning. It's not a notion that even makes sense according to standard mathematics. But if you make this number wau, it actually becomes possible to argue that all this equals 1. What amazing properties of wau can you come up with?",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_vi-hart
" The Ubas are moving from Houston to Egypt. They pack their belongings in rectangular crates and hire a boxcar to ship the crates across land and sea. The crates are made specifically to fit inside the boxcar with their bases facing down. Each crate has a base 5 meters long by 1.5 meters wide. So let me draw that. So crate is 5 meters long, and 1.5 meters wide, and has a height of 2 meters. So its height might look something like this. So it has a height of 2 meters. So that's each of the crates. And they're designed to fit inside a boxcar. So this is a crate right over here. I'll do my best to draw a crate. And they give us the dimensions of the boxcar. A boxcar is 15 meters long. So let me draw a boxcar here. So it's 15 meters long. Maybe I'll try to make sure I can fit it on the page. So that this whole distance would be 5 meters, and then another 5 meters here, and then another 5 meters here. So that would be 15 meters long. So you could fit three of the crates along an edge like that. And then, they tell us that it is 3 meters wide. So this is 1.5 meters wide. So you could put two of these to get you to 3 meters. Let me draw this so we can see what's going on behind the scenes. So you could go 3 meters wide for a boxcar, and then it is 4 meters high. So each of these are 2 meters high. So you could stack one more. And so you have 2 meters plus 2 meters. This entire distance right over here is going to be 4 meters. And I could draw the rest of the boxcar like this. So there's a couple of ways to think about how many crates you could fit in a boxcar. One way would be just the way that we're doing it right now. We could visualize. How many can you fit in this direction along the length? How many can you fit along the width? And how many can you fit along the height? And essentially, if we multiply those three numbers, we would have counted the number of crates that could fit inside. So you could fit 1, 2, 3 along the length. So that'd be 3. You could fit 2 along the width. 1.5 and 1.5 gets you to 3 meters, so times 2. And then you could fit 2 along the height, so times 2, gets us to 3 times 2 is 6 times 2 is 12. You can fit 12 crates in the boxcar. Now, another way you could have done it is you could say, OK, they're telling us that these are designed to fit. So we really just have to compare the volumes. How many times more is the volume of the box car than the crate? I like doing it this way more, just to make sure that the dimensions actually work out, so that you could actually squeeze these in. Because if the dimensions aren't right, even if the boxcar is 12 times the volume of one of the crates, if the crates don't have the right dimensions, you might not be able to squeeze exactly 12 crates in there. But they're telling us that it is the exact dimensions. So we could figure out the dimensions of the boxcar, then the dimensions of the crate. And then we could figure out how much larger the boxcar is, how many times larger. Let's do the boxcar in this blue color. The boxcar is 15 meters long, 3 meters wide, and 4 meters high. So boxcar volume is equal to 15 in cubic meters. So there's 15 meters times 3 meters times 4 meters. So this is going to be in cubic meters. So this is going to be-- let's see, 15 times 3 is 45. 45 times 4 is 180 cubic meters. That's the boxcar volume. And then what's the volume of the crate? Well, the crate volume-- if we do our math right, it should come out to 1/12 of this, because that's what we just figured out, is 5 times 1.5 times 2. So 5 times 1.5 times 2. Well, 1.5 times 2 is 3, times 5 is 15, so 15 cubic meters. So how many times larger is the boxcar than the crate? Well, what's 180 divided by 15? Well, it's exactly 12. 10 times 15 is 150. And then 2 times 15 is 30. 150 plus 30 is 180. So notice, 180 divided by 15 is 12. So either way, however you think about it-- I find this one to be a little bit easier to kind of just visualize the boxes-- you can fit 12 crates in the boxcar.",math_cc-seventh-grade-math_cc-7th-geometry
" -  In this video we are going to introduce ourselves to the idea of permutations, which is a fancy word for a pretty straight forward concept, which is what are the number of ways that we can arrange things? How many different possibilities are there? And to make that a little bit tangible, let's have an example with say a sofa. My sofa can seat exactly three people. I have seat number one on the left of the sofa, seat number two in the middle of the sofa, and seat number three on the right of the sofa. And let's say we're going to have three people who are going to sit in these three seats, person A, person B, and person C. How many different ways can these three people sit in these three seats? Pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. Well, there's several ways to approach this. One way is just try to think through all of the possibilities. You could do it systematically. You could say alright, if I have person A in seat number one, then I could have person B in seat number two, and person C in seat number three. And I could think of another situation. If I have person A in seat number one, I could then swap B and C. So it could look like that. And that's all of the situations, all of the permutations where I have A in seat number one. So now let's put someone else in seat number one. So now let's put B in seat number one, and I could put A in the middle and C on the right. Or I could put B in seat number one, and then swap A and C. So C and then A. And then if I put C in seat number one, well I could put A in the middle and B on the right. Or with C in seat number one, I could put B in the middle and A on the right. And these are actually all of the permutations and you can see that there are one, two, three, four, five, six. Now this wasn't too bad. And in general, if you're thinking about permutations of six things or three things in three spaces, you can do it by hand. But it could get very complicated if I said, hey, I have 100 seats and I have 100 people that are going to sit in them. How do I figure it out mathematically? Well the way that you would do it, and this is going to be a technique that you can use for really any number of people and any number of seats is to really just build off of what we just did here. What we did here is we started with seat number one and we said alright, how many different possibilities are, how many different people could sit in seat number one assuming no one has sat down before. Well, three different people could sit in seat number one. You could see it right over here. This is where A is sitting in seat number one, this is where B is sitting in seat number one, and this is where C is sitting in seat number one. Now for each of those three possibilities, how many people can sit in seat number two? Well, we saw when A sits in seat number one, there's two different possibilities for seat number two. When B sits in seat number one, there's two different possibilities for seat number two. When C sits in seat number one, this is a tongue-twister, there's two different possibilities for seat number two. And so, you're gonna have two different possibilities here. Another way to think about it is, one person has already sat down here, there's three different ways of getting that, and so there's two people left who could sit in the second seat and we saw that right over here, where we really wrote out the permutations. And so how many different permutations are there for seat number one and seat number two? Well, you would multiply. For each of these three you have two, for each of these three in seat number one, you have two in seat number two. And then what about seat number three? Well, if you know who's in seat number one and seat number two, there's only one person who can be in seat number three. And another way to think about it, if two people have already sat down, there's only one person who could be in seat number three. And so mathematically, what we could do is just say three times two times one. And you might recognize the mathematical operation factorial, which literally just means hey, start with that number, and then keep multiplying it by the numbers one less than that and then one less than that all the way until you get to one. And this is three factorial, which is going to be equal to six, which is exactly what we got here. And to appreciate the power of this, let's extend our example. Let's say that we have five seats. One, two, three, four, five. And we have five people, person A, B, C, D, and E. How many different ways can these five people sit in these five seats? Pause this video and figure it out. Well, you might immediately say well that's going to be five factorial, which is going to be equal to five times four times three times two times one. Five times four is 20. 20 times three is 60. And then 60 times two is 120. And then 120 times one is equal to 120. And once again, that makes a lot of sense. If no one's sat down, there's five different possibilities for seat number one. And then for each of those possibilities, there's four people who could sit in seat number two. And then for each of those 20 possibilities in seat numbers one and two, well there's gonna be three people who could sit in seat number three. And for each of these 60 possibilities, there's two people who can sit in seat number four. And then once you know who's in the first four seats, you know who has to sit in that fifth seat. And that's where we got that 120 from.",math_precalculus_prob-comb
" Jamie's dad gave her a die for her birthday. She wanted to make sure it was fair, so she took her die to school and rolled it 500 times and kept track of how many times the die rolled each number. Afterwards, she calculated the expected value of the sum of 20 rolls to be 67.4, the expected value of the sum of 20 rolls to be 67.4. On her way home from school, it was raining, and 2 values were washed away from her data table. Find the 2 missing absolute frequencies from Jamie's data table. So you see here, she rolled her die 500 times, and she wrote down how many times she got a 2. She got a 2 110 times, a 3 95 times, a 4 70 times, a 5 75 times, and then she had written down how many times she got a 1 and a 6, but then it got washed away, so we need to figure out how many times she got a 1 and a 6, given the information on this table right over here and given the information that the expected value of the sum of 20 rolls is 67.4. I encourage you to pause this video and think about it on your own before I give a go at it. So first, let's think about what this expected value, the sum of 20 rolls being 67.4 tells us. That means that the expected value of 1 roll, the expected value of the sum of 20 rolls is just 20 times the expected value of 1 roll. The expected value of a roll, let me do it here, expected value of a roll is going to be equal to 67.4 divided by 20. We can get our calculator out. Let's see. So we have 67.4 divided by 20 is 3.37. So this is equal to 3.37. So how does that help us? We know how to calculate an expected value given this frequency table right over here. If we say that this number right over here, let's say that's capital A and let's say that this number here is capital B, if we were to try to calculate the expected value of a roll, what we really want to do is take the weighted frequency of each of these values, the weighted sum. So, for example, if we got a 1 A out of 500 times, it would be A out of 500 times 1, times 1 plus, I'll do this in different colors, plus 110 out of 500 times 2, plus 110 out of 500 times 2. Notice, this is the frequency which was they got 2 times 2. We're taking a weighted sum of these values. And then plus 95 out of 500 times 3, plus 95 out of 500 times 3, plus, I think you see where this is going, 70 over 500 times 4, plus 70 over 500 times 4, almost there, plus, let's see, I haven't used this brown color, plus 75 over 500 times, I'll do it here, plus 75 over 500 times 5. Finally, plus B over 500, plus B over 500 times 6, this is going to give us our expected value of a roll, which is going to be equal to 3.37. So all of this is equal to 3.37. One thing that we can do, since we have all these 500s and this denominator right over here, let's multiply both sides of this equation times 500. If we do that, the left-hand side becomes, well, 500 times A over 500 is just going to be A plus 110, plus 110 times 2. So it's going to be 220. Plus 95 times 3, that's going to be 15 less than 300, so it's going to be plus 285, plus 285, and then 70 times 4 is 280, plus 280. 75 times 5 is going to be 350 plus 25, 375, so plus 375, plus 6B. let me make sure I'm not skipping any steps here, plus 6B is going to be equal to this times 500, and that is going to be equal to 3.37 times 500 is equal to 1,685, 1,685. All I did to go from this step right over here, which I set up saying here, this is the expected value of one roll, which we already know to be 3.37, is I just multiplied both sides of this equation by 500. I just did this times 500, and I did this times 500, and this 500 obviously cancels with all of these, and then 500 times 3.37 is 16.85, and so I got this right over here. Now, I got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Yup, I did enough. I have the right number of terms. I just want to make sure I'm not making a careless mistake. If we want to simplify this, we can subtract 220, 285, 280, and 375 from both sides. If we did that, we would get A, if we subtract that from the left-hand side, we're just going to get A plus 6B, A plus 6B. And on the right-hand side, we are going to get, let's get our calculator out, 1,685 minus 220, 220, minus 285 minus 280 minus 375 gets us to 525. So we get A plus 6B is equal to 525. You say, ""OK, you did all that work, ""but we still have one equation with 2 unknowns. ""How do we figure out what A and B actually are?"" We know something else, We know, and this is actually much easier to figure out, we know that the sum of this whole table right over here, A plus 110 plus 95 plus 70 plus 75 plus B is equal to 500. Or if we ... Let me write that down. So we know that A plus 110 plus 95 plus 70 plus 75 plus B needs to be equal to 500. Or we could subtract 110 plus 95 plus 70 plus 75 from both sides and get, if you subtract it from the left-hand side, you're just left with A plus B, A plus B, and on the right-hand side, if we start with 500, so 500 minus 110 minus 95 minus 70 minus 75 gets us to 150. So A plus B must be equal to 150, is equal to 150. Now we have a system of 2 equations and 2 unknowns, and so we know how to solve those. We could do it by substitution or we could subtract the second equation from the first, so let's do that. Let's subtract the left-hand side of this equation from that or essentially, we could multiply this one times a negative 1 and then add these 2 equations. The As are going to cancel out, and we are going to be left with 6B minus B is 5B is equal to 375, is equal to 375. Did I do that right? If I add 125 to this, I get to 500, then another 25, I get to 525. So 5B is equal to 375, or if we divide both sides by 5, we get B is equal to 75. B is equal to 75. This right over here is equal to 75. If B is equal to 75, what is A? We know that A plus B is equal to 500. We figured that out a little while ago before we multiplied both sides of this times a negative 1. We knew that A plus B, when B is now 75, so we could say A plus 75, is equal to 150, and that's just from this, we figured out that A plus B is equal to 150 before we multiplied both sides times a negative. Subtract 75 from both sides, you get A is also equal to 75. And we are done.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-probability-of-events
" -  So they are telling us that r fifths is equal to eight tenths and we need to figure out what is r going to be equal to and they help us out with this number line where they've put eight tenths on the number line. That makes sense because to go from zero to one, they've split it into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten equal jumps and at this point, we have gone eight of those ten equal jumps between zero and one so that is eight tenths and they've also labeled one fifth for us and one way to think about it is if we look at these bold lines, zero, one, two, three, four, five, if you just look at the purple, we have five equal jumps. So each of those jumps are a fifth and so it makes sense that our first jump right over here gets us to one fifth and you can see that that is equivalent to two of the tenths. I'll just write that up here so we can see that equivalence. One fifth is equal to two tenths but how many fifths is equal to eight tenths? Pause this video and try to figure it out. All right, well this is one fifth. If we do one more jump of a fifth, that would be two fifths. Then if we go another fifth, that will get us to three fifths and then if we go another fifth, that will get us to four fifths which we see is exactly equivalent to eight tenths and that makes sense because we also saw that every fifth is equivalent to two tenths. So four fifths is going to be equivalent to eight of those tenths. We see that very clearly right over here and so r is equal to four. Four fifths is equal to eight tenths. So r is equal to four. Let's do another example. What fraction is equivalent to point A? So pause this video and see if you can figure that out. All right, so let's figure out where point A is. So to go from zero to one, we have one, two, three, four, five, six equal jumps. So each of these jumps are a sixth. So going from zero, one jump will get us to one sixth, then two sixths, then three sixths, then four sixths, then five sixths and so can we see four sixths in the choices? No I do not see four sixths. So we have to find an equivalent fraction to four sixths. So we could go choice by choice. The first choice has five sixths. Well we very clearly see that five sixths would be here on the number line which is clearly a different place than four sixths. So we could rule out this first choice but what about these other ones? Let's see, let's see how we can think about. Four fifths versus four sixths. Could those be equivalent? If I have four out of five versus four out of six, that's not feeling too good so I'm gonna put like a curly line through it. That's not feeling right, that if I could have four out of five equal jumps or five equal sections, that that would be the same as four out of six equal sections. If I divided it into six equal sections, each of those sections are going to be a little bit smaller than if I divided into five equal sections. So if I have four of each, they're going to be a different value. Actually when I talk it out like that, I feel even more confident that I could rule this one out. Now what about six fourths? Well one way to think about it is four fourths would be equal to one. So six fourths is going to be beyond one. So it's definitely not going to be where A is, so I could rule that one out and we could say oh, well maybe it's just going to be D but let's make sure that this makes sense. Two thirds, what does two thirds look like? Well let me try to divide this part of the number line from zero to one into thirds, into three equal sections. So I have zero there and then that could be one third, two thirds and then three thirds. That looks like three equal sections. So this is one third, this is two thirds, I'm making another jump of a third and then when I get to one, of course that is three thirds or we could have said six sixths and so point A, which is right over here I'm writing over it, that is indeed equal to two thirds. You can see each jump of a third is equal to two sixths. So it makes sense that four sixths is equal to two thirds or that two thirds is equal to four sixths so I like this one.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_comparing-fractions-and-equivalent-fractions
" Use the associative law of addition to write the expression. We have a 77 plus 2 in parentheses, plus 3, in a different way. Simplify both expressions to show they have identical results. So this associative law of addition, which sounds very fancy and complicated, literally means that you can associate these three numbers in different ways or you can add them in different orders. Now let me just make that clear. So the way they wrote it right here, they wrote it 77 plus 2 in parentheses, and then they wrote plus 3. These parentheses mean do the 77 plus 2 before you add the 3. So if you were to evaluate this, you would evaluate what's in the parentheses first. So you would say, well, 77 plus 2, that's 79, so everything in the parentheses just evaluates to 79. And then you still have that plus 3. And 79 plus 3 is 82, so this is equal to 82. That's if you just evaluate it the way that they gave it to us. Now, the associative law of addition tells us it doesn't matter whether we add 77 and 2 first or whether we add 2 and 3 first. We can associate them differently. So this is going to be the exact same thing. This is the exact same thing as-- we could write it this way. Let me write them all. 77 plus 2 plus 3. If we have no parentheses here, this is actually the same thing as this over here, because we'd go 77 plus 2 is 79 plus 3 is 82. But the associative law tells as, well, you know what? I could do 77 plus 2 plus 3. I could add this first and then add it to 77, and it's going to be the exact same thing as if I added these two guys first and then add the 3. Let's verify that for ourselves. So 2 plus 3 is 5, so this evaluates to 77 plus 5. And 77 plus 5, once again, is 82. So it doesn't matter how you associate the numbers. Either way, you get 82. And that's the associative law of addition.",math_pre-algebra_pre-algebra-arith-prop
" -  All right, I'm going to tell you about the Decibel Scale. This is the scale that we use to figure out the loudness of a sound. The equation that goes along with it looks like this. Beta equals 10 log, or logarithm, base 10 of I divided by 10 to the negative 12 watts per square meter. This looks intimidating. Let's talk about it and break it down. Beta is the number of decibels. So this side gives you the number of decibels and we abbreviate decibel with a little d, capital B. This is the number of dBs or decibel. You've probably seen this number on your stereo. Somewhere reader just in volume because we're going to measure volume and Decibels. 10, this 10 just denotes the fact that this is the Deci-bel Scale and not just the bel scale. If you didn't multiply by 10, you'd have the bel scale but this is multiplied by 10. We like the 10. We're going to call is Decibel. Log, we'll talk about log in a minute. Logarithm here. I is the intensity of the sound wave. So this is the intensity. In Physics, intensity is defined to be the power divided by the area. What this means, think about it this way. You got your ear and a sound wave, say, is coming toward your ear. If you imagine, one. Power's in, what? Power measure going to watts. Area's measure going to square meter. So think about intensity this way. If you have one square meter. Imagine one square meter of area here. This doesn't have to be an actual physical object. Just imagine a square meter of area. The power that passes through that area will be, how many joules? If you figure you how many joules pass through this one square meter. If you asked how many joules per second pass through that one square meter. How many joulels of sound energy per second pass through the one square meter? That would be the number of watts per meter squared which would be the intensity. So watts is joules per second. This gives you an idea of how much energy per second pass through a certain amount of area. This part of the equation is my favorite. This is my all-time favorite right here. This number. This 10 to the negative 12 watts per square meter represents the threshold of human hearing. What that means is this is the softest possible sound you can hear. Any sound with an intensity less than that. You won't even notice. But if it's anything bigger than that, a human ear that's healthy should be able to detect it. Here is why I like this number. This is unbelievably small. This is one trillion of a watt per meter square. A trillion. What this says is that even if only one trillionth of a joule per second passes through the square meter, your ear would still be able to detect the sound that soft. If that doesn't impress you, let me put it to you this way. Imagine we did have one watt. Let me put it to you this way. If you have one watt, how big of an area? A watt isn't really that much. A watt is not a lot of power. If you have one watt, how big could you make this area? How, spread out. How diluted could one watt be spread over? How large of an area could this one watt be spread over and still be intense enough for the human ear to hear it? What do you think? Football field? I don't know, a city? No, it turns out. If you do the calculation, I suggest you do it. It's interesting. You would get, that you can spread one watt over the entire land area of Germany, about three times over, and still it's intense enough for the human ear to hear. That's how unbelievably sensitive our ears are. It's actually... I told you it's unbelievable. I can hardly believe it myself. Let's come back over to here. So here's our equation. This is the Decibel Scale. Why log? That's what you're thinking. ""Why in God's name did the physicist have ""to put logarithm in here? ""This scare me."" This used to scare me too. Well, I'll show you why. Here's the problem. The fact that we can hear such a soft sound, 10 to the negative 12 watts per meter squared, there's a huge range of human hearing. This means we can hear from 10 to the negative 12 watts per square meter. This is your point zero, zero, say three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, with a one watts per square meter all the way where there's no upper limit. It just blow out your ears. But once you get to about one watt per square meter, this one will start hurting. This is painful. You're not going to be happy over here. You're just going to start hurting. You'll start getting hearing losses and not good. So it's a huge range. 12 orders of magnitude. This one watt per square meter is a trillion times bigger than this side. This scale is just way too big. This is awkward. We want to scale that's small or maybe like one to 100 to measure loudness. We don't want to measure from one to a trillion or a trillion to one. That's what log's going to do. Logs are great. This is a trick for this use. This is why I love this trick. Logarithms take really big or really small numbers and turn them into nice numbers. That's why we're going to use the logarithm. Let me show you what I mean. Logarithm, if you don't remember, here's what a logarithm does. Log base 10 of a number equals, here's what it does. I'm going to stick a number in here. Let's stick 100000. What log does, log is a curious guy. Log is always asking a question. Log always wants to know, okay, if I'm log base 10, log wants to know what number would I raise 10 to in order to get this number in here. So log looks at this number in the parentheses. This entire number here and asks what number should I raise 10 to in order to get 100000. Well, we know the answer to that. We should raise 10 to the fifth. If I raise 10 to the fifth, I'll get 100000. So if five is the number I raised 10 to get 100000, then that's the answer to this that log base 10 of 100000 is five. Look what happened. Log took a huge number, 100000, and turned it into five. Well, that's outstanding. Log can take huge numbers, turn them into nice numbers. The logarithm base 10 of one billion would be... One billion is a big number. That's hard to deal with but log takes 10 and asks what number can I raise 10 to in order to get a billion. I should raise 10 to the ninth because I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine zeros here. I raised 10 to the ninth to get this number. So the answer to this question for the logarithm is nine. Oops, that's not nine. Nine, and that's why logarithms are good. Logarithm took this enormous number of billion and turned it into nine. So logarithms take enormous scales turn them in nine scales. That's why we like this formula which is our Decibel Scale because it takes enormous intensities and small intensities, turns them into nice intensities. Let me show you an example with this equation really quick. Let's say you're talking to your friend. Maybe you're yelling at your friend. You guys are having a heated exchange. You're yelling. He's next to you. These are the sound waves coming at him. You're yelling with an intensity of, say 10 to the negative fifth. That doesn't sound like a lot but that's actually, you're pretty upset here. That's pretty loud. I want to know how many decibels is this. How do we figure out the decibels? Well, here's what we do. We use our formula for decibels. Beta, number of decibels, equals 10 log base 10 of the intensity over always 10 to the negative 12 watts per square meter because that's the softest sound we can hear. What do I get? 10 to the negative fifth is my intensity. So I plug this into here. I'm going to get beta equals 10 times the log base 10 of 10 to the negative fifth, because that's my intensity, divided by 10 to the negative 12. Now these are both watts per square meter. So let's cancel. Well, what's 10 to the negative fifth divided by 10 to the negative 12 turns out that's 10 to the seventh. I end up with 10 log of 10 to the seventh. Now I don't like logs. I'll be honest. They freak me out but I can even do this one. Log of 10 to the seventh. Remember what log does. It asks what number do I raise 10 to in order to get the thing in the parentheses. Well, the number I raise 10 to to get the thing in this parentheses, it's already 10 to the seventh. It's already in this form. So I've raised 10 to the seventh to get 10 to the seventh. So the answer to log base 10 1of 10 to the seventh is just seven. 1My final answer beta, the loudness, 1the number of decibels is going to be 10 times 1log of 10 to the seventh was just seven 1because I have to raise 10 to the seventh 1to get 10 to the seventh. 110 times seven equals 70. 1I'm yelling at 70 decibels. 1I need to calm down. 1My friend's going to start getting mad at me. 1That's how you figure out how loud the sound wave is.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-11th-physics-waves
"  What I want to do in this video is discuss what it means to be a metal, or metallic in nature. First, let's just think about the metals that we encounter in everyday life, or based on our experience the things that we associate with being a metal. The elements that really jump out at us as metals or we always refer to, ""Hey, that's a metal, ""or that's metallic,"" are things like iron, or nickel, or copper, or silver, or gold, or aluminum, or at least for me, these are the ones that immediately pop out. I've seen these things before, and they all feel like metals to me, but also think about what's true about these things and as we'll see many other elements on the periodic table that give them this metallic nature. What do we associate with having a metallic nature? One is that these things can be shiny. These things tend to be shiny. There's kind of a gloss when light shines on it. They're not just kind of a matte color. They look metallic literally. That's sometimes a word that's used for it. It has a metallic shininess to it. Another thing that we associate with it is that they tend to be fairly dense. If I take a metal, a block of a metal and if I drop it into water, I imagine that sinking, not floating on top of the water. We also imagine them having a very high melting point, that they tend to be solid at room temperature. Solid at room temperature. As we'll see, this is true of all metals except for one of them which is mercury which is shiny but at room temperature as you might be familiar is in its liquid form. Now the other things that I associate with a metal is that I can make things out of them. I can bend them and shape them in different ways. I think of aluminum foil. I can bend it. It's not just going to crack. I can bend it and put it into different shapes. Even things like iron it might take a lot of pressure to do it, but they're bendable, they're malleable, and definitely things like gold and silver and copper you can actually mold into different types of jewelry. If you put pressure on it, it's more likely to bend than crack and just kind of shear off. So let's put malleability. They're malleable. The other thing I associate with metals is that they conduct electricity well. Conduct electricity. A place that you'll see metal in your life is if you open up your electronics you'll see wires that might be made out of copper, or you might have components that are made out of other metals like gold, or silver, or whatever else. Given that these are some of the properties that we associate with metals, let's think about what's happening at the atomic level to give these elements these properties. The way I think about it let's just go with copper for a second. Let's just imagine a block of copper at the atomic level. Let's say this is one copper nucleus right over there, and it has its sea of electrons. It has its sea of electrons, or not its sea of electrons. It has all of its electrons in their various orbitals. We'll talk about sea of electrons in a second, but this is kind of its cloud of electrons I should say. So this is electron cloud. The electrons are just jumping around in this cloud. It's really a probability density, or there's kind of a certain probability that could be at any point in that cloud. Let's imagine a big solid piece of copper. You would have a bunch of these. You would have a bunch of these all together, all forming the solid. What allows metals to be malleable, to do things like conduct electricity which is the movement of electrons, is essentially that they're very willing to share electrons with each other. By sharing electrons, so you can imagine this is one copper atom and that's another, let's say they're sharing some electrons, that's what allows the electricity or this flow of electrons to happen. If these electrons are loosely bound, then if you put a potential difference of voltage, let's say that you put a potential difference so that this side is more negative, and then this side is more positive, then the electrons are going to want to get away from the negative charge, and move towards the positive charge. If they're relatively freely bound, they can kind of move from one cloud to the next. You kind of end up having what's often called a sea of electrons. Let me write that down. You have a sea of electrons which would make this conductive and that's why you see so much wire made out of copper. The sea of electrons is also what makes it malleable. If someone on this side were to put a lot of pressure this way, and on that side put a lot of pressure that way, things that are rigid would just kind of crack and break, right, would just break right over there, but because you have the sea of electrons it allows it to be malleable. This part might just bend down a little bit, that part might bend up, but they're not going to, the metallic bond is not going to break. Given that this metallic nature really comes from the willingness of these atoms to share electrons with each other, to create the sea of electrons, I encourage you to pause this video and think about which atoms on the periodic table, or which elements are more likely to do that, to share electrons with others and with each other. Really, this is the same principle that we thought about ionization energy, and electronegativity. So pause the video. I'm assuming you've had a go at it. So which elements are most likely to share electrons? We've already seen that if we're on the left side of the periodic table of elements, Group One for example, they only have one valence electron. It would be very hard for them to get enough electrons to complete that outer shell. If they get rid of that one valence electron, they can go to a more stable state. They really want to give away electrons, and the ones over here, they're so close if we talk about the halogens, they're one electron away from completing their outer shell. They're greedy. They want to hog these electrons. They tend to be electronegative. The noble gases, they're done. They definitely don't want to share electrons with anyone. They're kind of in a very stable state. Now, the other thing that we've talked about is as we go down a group, our atoms are getting larger, and larger, and larger. So the outermost, that 55th electron in cesium is much more loosely bound because it's further away than say the third electron in lithium. So just as we saw as the elements in this bottom left have a very low ionization energy. It doesn't take much energy to remove an electron from them, these are the ones that are most likely to share electrons, and these actually have the highest metallic nature. So high metallic, high metallic nature. The ones on the top right, these are going to be the opposite. They're very unlikely to share electrons. They're very electronegative. They have a very high ionization energy. They have a low metallic nature. I could imagine some things are popping into your brain at this point. We started thinking of the elements that in our everyday life we associate with metals, but what I'm saying is that these things over have an even higher metallic nature, but what about something like calcium. Every day what I imagined when I typically, or when a lot of people imagine calcium, they think of kind of a chalky, a white chalky substance, very rigid, not very malleable, not very good, not very shiny, not very good at conducting electricity. Based on what I just told you, this would have a higher metallic nature than something like aluminum. What you have to remind yourself is that what you see is not actually pure calcium, that kind of chalky thing. That's calcium carbonate. Pure calcium, actually, this is actually a picture of pure calcium. It is shiny. It does have these metallic properties. The general trend here is that all of these, these are very high in metallic nature, and these are very low metallic nature which also makes you probably realize while most of the periodic table is a metal of some form. If aluminum is a metal, and all of these things have a higher, have a higher metallic nature than all of this stuff, all of this stuff are metals, and that is the case. The S block, the D block, the F block, these are all metals. Then a good chunk of the P block, a good chunk of the P block are considered metals, and then these are kind of sometimes referred to as metalloids, Only this section of the periodic table is not considered a metal. That makes sense. Nobel gases, they are gases. They don't, they're not very reactive. they don't bond so they don't form kind of a structure that can even do this type of thing. These other ones over here even carbon when it is formed a lattice, it does not conduct electricity well. It tends to not be so malleable if you think about something like a diamond, or if you think about, well, a diamond might be the best example of that. Anyway, hopefully this gives you a sense of metallic nature and the trends in the periodic table. High metallic nature, and as you go to the top right, lower and lower metallic nature.",science_ap-chemistry_chemical-bonds-ap
" -  What we're going to do in this video is multiply the numbers 352 and 481. And we're gonna do it in two different ways, but realize that the underlying ideas are the same. So first let's just appreciate that 352 can be rewritten as 300 plus 50 plus two or we could think of it as two plus 50 plus 300, plus 300. You add these three numbers together, you're going to have 352. And same idea, 481 that's four hundreds, four hundreds, plus eight tens, which is 80, so plus 80, and then we have one one, so plus one. And you might have be familiar with multiplying like this in the past, setting up this grid. And it's essentially we're applying the distributive property. We're gonna take the two and multiply it times 400 plus 80 plus one. So we're gonna multiply two times each of those numbers, and actually I'm gonna just draw some quick lines here. So we have that, and then we'll have let me do it like this, then we have this, and then let me set up my grid. I'm having trouble drawing straight lines, okay there we go. Then one more in this direction. There you go. And then in this direction, let me draw some horizontal lines to have a neat clean grid here. There we go. Now first we'll multiply two times 400 plus 80 plus one. So two times 400 is 800. Two times, let me do it in that same blue color, so this is 800. Two times 80 is 160, and then two times one is two. And then we can multiply 50 times these. So what's 50 times 400? Well five times four is 20, and then we have another one, two, three zeros. So one, two, three, so that's 20,000. 50 times 80, five times eight is 40, and then we have two zeros, just like that. And then we have 50 times one which is of course going to be equal to 50. And then we go to the 300, which we will distribute and multiply times each of these, each of these numbers. 300 times 400, three times four is 12, and then we have four zeros. One, two, three, four. We get 120,000. 300 times 80, three times eight is 24, and then we have one, two, three zeros. One, two, three, so we get 24,000. And then 300 times one is of course equal to 300. And then what we wanna do is add up all of these numbers. So let's actually add up the rows first. So if we add up the rows, let me draw another line going straight down like that. And so if we sum this up, this is going to be 962. 800 plus 160 is 960 plus two, so this is 962. This right over here is 24,050. 24,050. And then this right over here is what 100 and, 144,300? 144,300. 120,000 plus 24,000 is 144,000 plus 300, there you have it. And then you would add up these numbers just like that to get your final answer. Now I'm gonna hold off doing that for a second as we see the other way of multiplying these numbers. So the other way of doing it, we could've said, 481, and this is sometimes called the standard algorithm, 481 times 300 and 50, let me do the same colors, 352. And in the standard algorithm, the way that we do it is we start with this two in the ones place and then we multiply it times 481. So two times one is two, two times eight is 16. So we put the six here and then we sometimes we will say we carry the one, but really regrouping that as hundreds. That's 10 tens which is hundreds. And then two times four is eight, which is really 800, plus one, so that's nine or really 900. You see a pattern here. This 962 is the exact same thing as that 962 right over there. Why? Well because we multiplied the 200 times the one, times the 80, times the 400. We saw that over here, and then we just added 'em all together to be 962. That's all the standard algorithm did just now. And then we move over to the five. But this is really five tens or 50, and that's why in the standard algorithm we put a zero here before saying all right what's five times one? It's five. What's five times eight? It is 40. We regroup the four. Let's delete this from before. What's five times four? Well that's 20 plus four is 24. Notice 24,050, that's exactly what we had over here, and it makes sense because we're taking a 50 and we're multiplying it times 481 which is exactly what we did right over there. And so you might guess what's gonna happen when we take this three and we multiply it times 481. That's really a 300 times 481. Let me delete that so I don't get confused. So because it's a 300, in the standard algorithm, we put two zeros here first. And when I say algorithm it just means a method of doing something. And so we'll say three times one is three. Three times eight is 24. And then three times four is 12 plus two is 14. And so notice, I have 144,300. And the standard way of doing it at this point we just add 'em all up. So whether we're doing it here or here, we just add everything up. So two plus zero plus zero is two. Six plus five is 11. Regroup that one. So one plus nine plus three is 13. And then one plus four plus four is nine. Two plus four is six. Then we have a one right over there, so we get 169,312. And so when you just learn this method, the standard algorithm we some people might call it, it might seem like hey this just seems like a little bit of magic. But all you're doing is you're going to each of these places and you're distributing it, you're multiplying it times 400 plus 80 plus one to get this. Then you're multiplying 50 times 400 plus 80 plus one, and then 300 times 400 plus 80 plus one, exactly what we did right over here.",math_in-in-class-5th-math-cbse_multi-digit-multiplication-and-division
" Determine whether the points on this graph represent a function. Now, just as a refresher, a function is really just an association between members of a set that we call the domain and members of the set that we call a range. So if I take any member of the domain, let's call that x, and I give it to the function, the function should tell me what member of my range is associated with it. So it should point to some other value. This is a function. It would not be a function if it says, well, it could point to y. Or it could point to z. Or maybe it could point to e or whatever else. This would not be a function. So this right over here not a function, because it's not clear if you input x what member of the range you're going to get. In order for it to be a function, it has to be very clear. For any input into the function, you have to be very clear that you're only going to get one output. Now, with that out of the way, let's think about this function that is defined graphically. So the domains, the valid inputs, are the x values where this function is defined. So for example, it tells us if x is equal to negative 1-- if we assume that this over here is the x-axis and this is the y-axis-- it tells us, when x is equal to negative 1, we should output. Or y is going to be equal to 3. So one way to write that mapping is you could say, if you take negative 1 and you input it into our function-- I'll put a little f box right over there-- you will get the number 3. This is our x. And this is our y. So that seems reasonable. Negative 1 very clear that you get to 3. Let's see what happens when we go over here. If you put 2 into the function, when x is 2, y is negative 2. Once again, when x is 2 the function associates 2 for x, which is a member of the domain. It's defined for 2. It's not defined for 1. We don't know what our function is equal to at 1. So it's not defined there. So 1 isn't part of the domain. 2 is. It tells us when x is 2, then y is going to be equal to negative 2. So it maps it or associates it with negative 2. That doesn't seem too troublesome just yet. Now, let's look over here. Our function is also defined at x is equal to 3. Our function associates or maps 3 to the value y is equal to 2. That seems pretty straightforward. And then we get to x is equal to 4, where it seems like this thing that could be a function is somewhat defined. It does try to associate 4 with things. But what's interesting here is it tries to associate 4 with two different things. All of a sudden in this thing that we think might have been a function, but it looks like it might not be, we don't know. Do we associate 4 with 5? Or do we associate it with negative 1? So this thing right over here is actually a relation. You can have one member of the domain being related to multiple members of the range. But if you do have that, then you're not dealing with a function. So once again, because of this, this is not a function. It's not clear that when you input 4 into it, should you output 5? Or should you output negative 1? And sometimes there's something called the vertical line test that tells you whether something is a function. When it's graphically defined like this, you literally say, OK, when x is 4, if I draw a vertical line, do I intersect the function at two places or more? It could be two or more places. And if you do, that means that there's two or more values that are related to that value in the domain. There's two or more outputs for the input 4. And if there are two or more outputs for that one input, then you're not dealing with a function. You're just dealing with a relation. A function is a special case of a relation. Or you could view it as a well-behaved relation.",math_math1_functions
" -  So they tell us that Alexander has nine marbles, Emily has five marbles. And then we're asked, how many more marbles does Alexander have than Emily? So pause the video and try to see if you could figure this out. Now let's work this out together. So let's just draw it out. Alexander has nine marbles. So we could draw his marbles. So one, two, three four, five six, seven eight, nine. And Emily has five marbles. One, two, three, four, five. So how many more marbles does Alexander have than Emily? Well we can see it in this picture right over here. These are all the... So, up until this point this is the same number that Alexander has as Emily. And then Alexander has... Alexander has... We see it right over here, he has one, two, three, four more marbles. Now what's another way that we could have thought about it? Well, Alexander has nine marbles and if you were to subtract the number of marbles Emily has, that's how much more marbles Alexander has. That's how much more nine is than five. So you could have said nine minus five is equal to... Is equal to the four... the four marbles. That's how much more marbles Alexander has than Emily. Let's do another one of these. Noa was mailing two letters. The heavier letter... The heavier letter had eight stamps. The lighter letter had five fewer stamps. How many stamps did the lighter letter have? So once again, try to pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. So the heavier letter, it's always useful to just, well, what are they telling us? So they are saying, just write down whatever information they give us. So the heavier letter has eight stamps, the lighter letter has five fewer stamps. So do we know how many the lighter letter has? Well not immediately. That's what they're actually asking us. How many stamps did the lighter letter have? But it's five fewer. Five fewer than what? Five fewer than eight stamps. And so we could write that. If we have eight stamps and we want to go five fewer than that... Five fewer... Well that's going to be eight minus five. This is five fewer than eight, which is going to be equal to three. The lighter letter has three stamps. Now another way you could have thought about it, The heavier letter had eight stamps. Let's draw eight stamps. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight. That's how much the heavier letter had. The lighter letter had five fewer stamps. Let's take away one, two, three four, five. And what are you going to be left with? Well you're going to be left with these three stamps right over here. This is how many stamps the lighter letter had.",math_in-in-class-1st-math-cbse_cc-1st-add-subtract
" Let's start with our classic system that I keep using over and over again. And that's because it tends to be very useful for instruction. It also tends to be the system that is most covered in classrooms. So hopefully it'll be productive for you and your school work. So I have this container. It has a movable piston on top, or kind of a movable ceiling. Well, of course, inside of my system I have a bunch of molecules or atoms bouncing around, creating some type of pressure on the system. So let's say it has some pressure, P1. This volume right here, let's call that V1. And let's say it also has some temperature that it starts off with. Everything is in equilibrium. Remember these are macro states. The only way I can even tell you what the volume, or the pressure, or the temperature is, is if the system is in equilibrium, if everything in it is uniform. The temperature is consistent throughout. Fair enough. And in order to keep it placed down, I have to put some rocks on top. And I've done this in multiple processes so far. And, of course, I'm doing these little pebbles, because I'm going to remove them slowly. Because I want to approximate a quasi-static process. Or I want to approximate a system that's always close enough to equilibrium that I'm cool with defining our macro states, our pressure, our temperature, or our volume. Let me write V for volume. Now, in this video, I'm going to study what's called an isothermic process. And really what it just means is, I'm going to keep the temperature the same. Iso- just means the same. You probably remember when we studied the periodic table. Isotopes, those are the same element just with different mass numbers. So this is the same temperature we're going to run our process. So my question is, how can we do that? Because as I remove pebbles, what's going to happen? If I just did this, without any-- if it was completely isolated from the world. And actually I'll add in a word right here. If it was an adiabatic process-- If it was adiabatic-- fancy word. All that means is, completely isolated from the world. So no heat is going into or out of this system. If this was the case, what would happen as I released or I took away some of these little particles? Let me copy and paste it. Well, let me just redraw it actually. So I have my one wall. I have another wall. I have another wall. As I release a couple of pebbles, one at a time, my volume is going to increase. So I'm going to have a slightly higher volume. My volume's going to go up. I have fewer pebbles here now. And since I have the same number of molecules, they're going to bump into this less. So pressure is going to go down. Volume is going to go up. And if I was adiabatic, if I had no extra heat being added to the system, what do I know is going to happen to the temperature? Well, think about it this way. Some work was done, right? Our old ceiling was maybe some place around here. We pushed it up with some force for some distance. So we did work. And so we changed some kinetic energy, or we transferred some kinetic energy, out of the system. That's essentially what the work did. That kinetic energy was turned into work. And temperature is just a macro measure of average kinetic energy. In fact, we just-- well, I won't go into it. But in the last video, the kind of proof you want-- if you didn't watch it because you didn't want to go through the math, which is completely fair enough because it normally wouldn't be done in an intro chemistry class-- I showed that the internal energy is equal to the total kinetic energy, which was equal to 3/2 times the number of moles, times R, times temperature. So temperature is just, by some scaling factor, a measure of kinetic energy. Now, when I do some work, it's essentially a transfer of kinetic energy. And I can't replace that energy with some heat because it's adiabatic. There's no heat going into or out of the system. So in that situation, the kinetic energy of the system went down. The average kinetic energy of the system went down. So the temperature would've also gone down. And actually, just as a bonus point, what happened to the internal energy? Well, the internal energy is the total kinetic energy of the system. And I could even right down the original formula. Change in internal energy is equal to change-- let me not do that, because I said I shouldn't-- is equal to heat added to the system, minus work done by the system. This is work done by the system. That's why we're subtracting it. Now, it's adiabatic, so there's no heat added to the system. So the change in internal energy is equal to the minus the work done by the system. Well, in this situation, the system did do work. It pushed this piston up by some distance with some force. So, your delta U is negative. It's less than 0. So U went down, and that makes sense. If temperature changed, then the internal energy is going to change. And for our simple system, where internal energy is represented by the kinetic energy of these molecules, that's always going to be the case. If temperature doesn't change, internal energy won't change. If temperature goes up, internal energy goes up. If temperature goes down, internal energy goes down. And, of course, they're not the same thing, though. The difference between internal energy and temperature is the scaling factor, 3/2 times the number of molecules, times our ideal gas constant. So fair enough. I went through this whole exercise just to show you that if I was completely isolated, and if I removed a couple of these pebbles, that my temperature is going to go down. Now, I told you already that I want to do an isothermic process. So I want to do this process while keeping the temperature the same. So how can I do that? Well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to place my system on top of what we'll call, a reservoir. So a reservoir, you can kind of view as an infinitely large amount of something that is the temperature that we started off with. So this reservoir is T1. So even though if, I took two relative things of comparable size. That says, temperature A. This is temperature B. And I've put them next to each other. They're going to average out to A plus B over 2, whatever their temperatures are. But if B is massive-- if A is just a speck of particle-- let's say it's iron dust-- while B is the Eiffel Tower, then essentially B's temperature will not change a lot. A will just become B's temperature. Now, a reservoir is theoretically infinitely large. It's an infinitely large object. So if something is next to a reservoir and is given enough time, it'll always assume the heat of the reservoir, or the temperature of the reservoir. So what's going to happen? So this is adiabatic, but now I'm actually putting it next to a reservoir. So this isn't going to happen. The adiabatic situation isn't going to happen. Now, I'm going to have a situation where I'm going to stay the same temperature. So what's that going to look like on the PV diagram? So let me draw the PV diagram. This is my pressure. This is my volume. So this is my starting point right here. And what I'm saying is, if I'm doing an isothermic process, so I just keep removing these pebbles. So I start at this state right here. Let me copy and paste it since I've done so much art already here. So I'm going from there to here where I'm removing a couple of the particles. So let's say I've removed a couple of them over here. And because of that, I've increased the volume. So let's say the volume, it's not there anymore. Let's say it's a little bit higher. Let's say the volume is-- just for the sake of our discussion-- let's say the volume has expanded a little bit, because I've remove some particles, the little pebbles on the top keeping it down. So it's like the adiabatic process, but instead of the temperature going down, my temperature stays at T1. My temperature's at T1 the entire time, because I'm next to this theoretical thing called a reservoir. So because of that, I will travel along what we'll call an isotherm. So this is my first state. When I'm done, I might end up some place over here. And so this is state 2. So this is state 2, this is state 1. What I'm claiming is that my path along this is going to be on some type of a rectangular hyperbola, or at least part of it. If I were to add rocks to it and compress it, I claim that my PV diagram would go like this. If I were to keep removing rocks from this diagram, I claim that my PV diagram would keep going like that. And so what's the intuition? That if I keep the temperature constant, that I'm essentially moving along this hyperbola. Well, let's just take out the ideal gas formula. Let me box off all this stuff over here. If I just take the ideal gas formula, PV is equal to nRT. If T is constant-- we know that R is a constant, it's the ideal gas constant. We know that we're not changing the number of moles 1of particles. 1Then that means that PV is equal to some constant. 1This whole thing is equal to some constant. 1And then, if we wanted to write P as a function of V, we 1would just write P is equal to K over V. 1Now, this might not look 100% familiar to you, but if I 1wrote it in algebraic terms, if I told you to graph y is 1equal to 1 over x, what does that look like? 1That's a rectangular hyperbola. 1That looks like this. 1And this is the y-axis, that's the x-axis, at least in this 1quadrant it looks like this. 1It also looks like that in the third quadrant, but we won't 1worry about that too much. 1So whenever you hold temperature constant, you're 1on some rectangular hyperbola like this, like an isotherm. 1Now, if the temperature was a different temperature, if it 1was a lower temperature, you'd be on a different isotherm. 1So you would be on an isotherm that looked like 1this, maybe over here. 1It would also be a rectangular hyperbola 1but at a lower state. 1Why is that? 1Because, if you're at a lower temperature, for any volume, 1you should have a lower pressure and that works out. 1That's why this is some temperature T2, that 1is lower than T1. 1So I want to do a couple of things in this video. 1I inadvertently explained to you what an adiabatic process 1is, and why the temperature would naturally go down on its 1own if you didn't have this reservoir here. 1But the whole reason why I even thought about doing this 1video is because I wanted you get comfortable with this idea 1of, one, that a reservoir will keep you in kind of an 1isothermic state. 1It will keep the temperature the same. 1And that if you keep the temperature the same, that you 1will travel along this isotherm, these rectangular 1hyperbolas. 1And that each temperature has 1associated with it an isotherm. 1So if you take that, let's just do one more step. 1And let's think about the actual work we did by 1traveling from this state to this state. 1Or if you just want to think of it in visual terms, from 1removing our pebbles slowly and slowly with this reservoir 1down here the whole time, from this state to this state. 1Where our volume has increased, our pressure has-- 1So our volume has increased. 1Our pressure has gone down. but our temperature has stayed 1the same the entire time. 1So, several videos ago, we learned that the work done is 1the area under this graph. 1It's the area under that graph. 1Or, if we want to do in calculus terms-- and I'm about 1to break into calculus, so if you don't want to see calculus 1cover your eyes or ears. 1It would be the integral. 1And the rest of this video will be a little bit mathy, 1and I guess I should make that statement on the 1title of the video. 1But if I want to calculate what this area is, 1I can now do this. 1The isotherm assumption makes our math a little bit easier. 1Because we know that PV is equal to nRT, ideal gas law. 1Or we could say P, if we divide both sides by V, is 1equal to nRT, divided by V. 1So there we have it. 1We have P as a function of V. 1This function right here, this graph right here, is this. 1We could write P as a function of v is equal to nRT over V. 1So if we want to figure out the area under the curve, we 1just integrate this function from our starting, our V1 to 1our ending point, to our V2. 1So what is that going to be? 1Well, we're going to integrate from V1 to V2. 1Actually, that shouldn't be an equal. 1The work is going to be the integral from V1 to V2, times 1our function, P as a function of V, times dV. 1We're summing up all of the little rectangles here. 1We did that a couple of videos ago. 1So what's P as a function of V? 1So work done is equal to, from V1 to V2, nRT 1over V, times dV. 1Now, this is our simplifying assumption. 1We said we're sitting on top of a reservoir. 1That this reservoir keeps our temperature the 1same the whole time. 1And we're going to learn in a second, it's doing that by 1transferring heat into the system. 1And we're going to calculate how much heat is transferred 1into the system. 1So, if we look at this right here, temperature-- since 1we're assuming we're on an isotherm, is a constant. n and 1R are definitely constants. 1So we can rewrite this integral as the integral from 1V1 to V2 of 1 over V, dV. 1And then we could put the nRT out here. 1I should have done that first. nRT, it's 1just a constant term. 1Now, what's the antiderivative of 1 over V? 1It's the natural log of V. 1So our work is equal to nRT times the natural log-- this 1is the antiderivative-- of V, evaluated at V2 minus it 1evaluated at V1. 1So that is equal to nRT times, evaluated at V2, so the 1natural log of V2. 1Minus the natural log of V1. 1Now we know from logarithm properties is the same thing 1as nRT times the natural log of V2 over V1. 1So there you have it, we actually 1calculated the real value. 1If we know our starting volume and our finishing volume, we 1can actually figure out the work done in 1this isothermic process. 1The work done in this isothermic process is the area 1under this. 1And we figured out what it was. 1By pushing up that piston, it was nRT. 1These are the number of moles we have, ideal gas constant. 1Our temperature that we're sitting on. 1It would be T1 in this case. 1And the natural log of our finishing volume divided by 1our starting volume. 1Now, let me ask a follow-up question. 1How much heat was put into the system by this isotherm here? 1It put in heat to keep the temperature up, otherwise the 1temperature would have gone down, right? 1Heat was going into the system the entire time. 1How much was it? 1Well, since it's an isotherm, since the temperature did not 1change, what do we know about the internal energy? 1Did the internal energy change? 1The temperature not changing told us that the kinetic 1energy didn't change. 1If the kinetic energy didn't change, then the internal 1energy did not change. 1And we know that the change in internal energy is equal to 1the heat put into the system minus the 1work done by the system. 1Now, if this is 0-- so we know that this didn't change, 1because the temperature didn't change. 1So that means 0 is equal to Q minus W, or that 1Q is equal to W. 1So this is the work done by the system. 1You'll end up getting something in joules. 1And this is also equal to the heat put into the system. 1It's also equal to Q. 1So when you look at this, if we were to just draw this part 1of the curve-- let me redraw it just to make things neat. 1I want to give you a little bit of the convention of what 1people in the thermodynamics world tend to do. 1I'll make a neat drawing here. 1We started here, at state 1. 1And we moved along this rectangular hyperbola, which 1is an isotherm, to state 2. 1And now we calculated the area under this, which is the work 1done, which was this value right here. 1Let me write it there. 1It's nRT natural log of V2 over V1. 1This is V2. 1This is V1. 1This whole axis, remember, was the V-axis, volume axis. 1This axis here was the pressure axis. 1And the convention is that because we did work, but we 1were constant temperature, so our internal energy didn't 1change, we had to add energy to the system to make up for 1the work we did. 1So some heat must have been added to the system. 1And then what they do is they just put this little downward 1arrow and they write a Q right there. 1So some heat was put into the system during this isothermic 1process right there. 1And the value of that Q is equivalent to the work we did. 1We put the exact amount of heat into the system as the 1work that was performed. 1And because of that, our internal energy didn't change. 1Or you could say our temperature didn't change. 1Or you could go the other way. 1Because our temperature didn't change, these two things have 1to be equal. 1Anyway, I want to leave you there. 1Hopefully I gave you a little bit more of an intuition of 1how PV diagrams work, a little bit more intuition behind what 1isotherms and adiabatic mean. 1And the most important thing is, once we get a little bit 1mathy, this result can be useful for coming up with 1other interesting things about a lot of these thermal systems 1that we're dealing with. 1See you in the next video.",science_chemistry_thermodynamics-chemistry
" -  Each small square in the diagram has a side length of one centimeter. So, what is the area of the figure? So, we have this figure down here in blue, and we want to know its area. Area is the total space it covers. And, we're also told that each of these little squares has a side length of one centimeter. So, that means that each of these squares is one square centimeter. So, we can find the area by seeing how many square centimeters does this figure cover? One way would be to just try to draw the little square centimeters and count them. There's one square centimeter, there's two, and so on and keep counting them all the way through. Or, what we could do is we could look at this and try to break it into two shapes. So we can say down here, into two rectangles. Down here we have one rectangle, and up here we have a second rectangle. And then we can find the area of each rectangle and add it together to find the total area that the figure covers. Down here on the bottom, we have two rows of unit squares. And each of those has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So there's two rows of seven unit squares, or seven square centimeters, so the bottom rectangle is made up of 14 square centimeters. It covers 14 square centimeters. And the top rectangle, let's see we have one row, two, three, four, five rows. And each of those rows has one, two square centimeters, so we have five rows of two square centimeters, or 10. So, this top rectangle here that we have in blue covers 10 square centimeters, plus the bottom rectangle that we outlined in green covers 14 square centimeters, so in total, the entire figure covers 24 square centimeters. So, 24 square centimeters is our area, because area is how much space does it cover, and we figured out that it covered 24 square centimeters.",math_in-in-class-6-math-india-icse_in-in-6-perimeter-and-area-icse
" -  We can calculate the depth d of snow, in centimeters, that accumulates in Harper's yard during the first h hours of a snowstorm using the equation d is equal to five times h. So d is the depth of snow in centimeters, h is time that elapses in hours. How many hours does it take for one centimeter of snow to accumulate in Harper's yard? Pause this video and see if you can figure that out. All right so we wanna figure out what h gives us a d of one centimeter. Remember d is measured in centimeters. So we really just need to solve the equation one centimeter, when d is equal to one, what is h going to be? And to solve for h we just need to divide both sides by five. So you divide both sides by five, the coefficient on the h, and you are left with h is equal to 1/5. And the unit for h is hours, 1/5 of an hour. So 1/5 of an hour. If they had minutes there, then you would say well 1/5 of an hour, there's 60 minutes, well this is 12 minutes. But they just want it as a number of hours, so 1/5 of an hour. How many centimeters of snow accumulates in per hour? Or this is a little bit of a typo. How many centimeters of snow accumulate in we could say one hour, in one hour, or they could have said how many centimeters of snow accumulate per hour. That's another way of thinking about it. So we could get rid of per hour. So pause the video and see if you can figure that out. Well there's a couple of ways to think about it. Perhaps the easiest one is to say, well what is d when h is equal to one? And so we could just say d when h is equal to one, when only one hour has elapsed, well it's going to be five times one which is equal to five, and our units for d are in centimeters. So five centimeters. Let's do another example. Betty's Bakery calculates the total price d in dollars for c cupcakes using the equation d is equal to two c. What does two mean in this situation? So pause this video and see if you can answer this question. So remember d is in dollars for c cupcakes. Now one way to think about it is, what happens if we take d is equal to two times c, what happens if we divide both sides by c? You have d over c is equal to two. And so what would be the units right over here? Well we have dollars, d dollars, over c cupcakes. So this would be $2, because that's the units for d, per cupcake, dollars per cupcake. This is the unit rate per cupcake. How much do you have to pay per cupcake? So which of these choices match up to that? The bakery charges $2 for each cupcake, yeah $2 per cupcake, that looks right. The bakery sells two cupcakes for a dollar. No that would be two cupcakes per dollar, not $2 per cupcake. The bakery sells two types of cupcakes. No no we're definitely not talking about two types of cupcakes, they're just talking about cupcakes generally, or I guess one type of cupcake, we don't know, but just cupcakes generally is $2 per cupcake.",math_7th-engage-ny_engage-7th-module-1
" -  Let's say we're having a birthday party and these are the kids at the birthday party. And all the kids, they have a bunch of different ages, and what we are curious about is how many kids of each age do we have? Well, to help think about that, we can draw what is called a line plot. And I've always viewed the term line plot a bit confusing because in my brain you use a lot more dots than you use lines, but let's look at what a line plot is. So what I will do is I will draw, I guess this involves a line right over here, I'll draw a line down here, and then I'll create buckets for each of the ages. So let's see, I have students here from age three all the way to age seven, so I could say age three, age four, age five, age six, and age seven. I don't have to go to two, or I don't have to go to eight. There aren't any kids in those ages. Although, I could if I want. And then I look at, well, how many kids do I have of each age? Well, I have one person attending the party, Diya, she's age three. So I would put, I might put an X here, or I could put a dot here. Different line plots would put different things here. But that shows me that I have, this partier (chuckles) is age three right over here. Now I have Imran, age five. So that's someone right over here who'd be at age five. You could think of this dot, this represents Imran, who's age five. Then you have Surya, who's also age five. He's also age five, so that means we have a second person at the party who is age five. So under age five, we now have two people. This is Imran and this is Surya. Then you have Jasper, who is six. So that's one person who is age six. Then you also have Vikram, who is age six. Whoops, let me do that in that same color. We also have Vikram, who is age six. So let's put him in the age six bucket. Then we have Luke, who is seven. Luke, who is seven. So that would be a dot right over there. And then finally I have Anya, who's also age six, who is also age six. So just like that, I was able to take all of the data that I have in this table, and I'm able to put it on this line plot. And the reason why this line plot is useful is it helps us look at, well, how many of each age do we have? It might be a little bit more confusing to just look at the table here because when you look at the line plot, it's very clear. Hey look, there's no one here who is age four. And look, we have the most people who are age six. And if we asked ourselves a question, if you didn't even have this. Actually, let me just even take it away. If we didn't even have that there, if we didn't have the table and we just had the line plot, and if someone said hey look, you know, these are ages right over here. This has our ages in years old, and each dot represents a student who's at the party. So based on this line plot, how many people are more than five years old? Well, you could look at this and you could say, okay, more than five years old. That would be six years old or seven years old. It's not showing anyone who's eight, nine, 10, 11, and on, and on, and on, and on. So let's look at all the dots. Let's look at all the dots here that are more than five years old. There are three six-year-olds and there's one seven-year-old. So there are one, two, three, four people who are old than five years old. You could go the other way around. You could say how many people are less than five years old? Well then you could say, okay, less than five years old would be either three years old or four years old. And when you look at those dots, you see there's only one dot. Only one person attending the party is less than five years old. Hopefully, you found that interesting.",math_4th-grade-foundations-engageny_4th-m5-engage-ny-foundations
" -  Gus plans to install a handrail around a skating rink. The rink forms a 40 meter by 20 meter rectangle. How many meters of handrail does Gus need? So here's what we know about the skating rink. It's a 40 meter by 20 meter rectangle. So let's draw the skating rink. That might help us to visualize, and we know that one side length is 40 meters and another side length is 20 meters. So Gus definitely needs to put some handrails 40 meters here and 20 meters here, but that is not enough. As somebody who doesn't know how to skate, I very much hope Gus puts handrail on this length and this length also. He needs to put the handrails all the way around the outside where what we could call the perimeter of the shape, the entire distance around the outside. Because the skating rink is a rectangle, we know that opposite sides are equal. So if this length is 40 meters up here, then this length down here must also be 40 meters. And we can do the same thing with 20. If we have 20 over here, then the length across must also be 20 meters. So now we can figure out the entire amount of handrail Gus needs, the amount of meters he needs to buy to put around the skating rink. For this first side here, he needs 40 meters plus to go down this side, he'll need another 20 meters of handrail. Going across the bottom of the rink, he'll need another 40 meters of handrail, and then, going up the side, he'll need another 20 meters of handrail. So we can add these to find the total amount he needs. 40 plus 20 is 60. Then 60 plus 40 plus 40 is 100, and 100 plus 20 more is 120 meters. So to go the entire distance around the outside of the skating rink, or the perimeter of the skating rink with handrail, Gus will need 120 meters of handrail.",math_in-in-class-3rd-math-cbse_3rd-perimeter
" -  We are told, ""Select the two fractions ""that are greater than one."" So pause this video and see if you can figure out which two of these fractions are greater than one. All right, now let's work on this together. And so, the main realization here, the main thing to pay attention to is how the numerator relates to the denominator. When we are at one, they're equal to each other. For example, one is equal to one whole. I guess you could write it that way, one oneths. Or you could also write it as two halves, is also equal to three thirds, is also equal to four fourths. We could go on and on. If you want it in terms of sixths, one would be equal to six sixths. And so, if whatever we have up here is larger than the denominator, so if we have seven sixths or if we were to have maybe five fourths. Notice, the numerator is larger than denominator. These are all situations when we are greater than one. And all the situations where the numerator is less than the denominator, so example one half or nine 11ths, or 10 11ths, these are all situations where we are less than one. All of this is less than one. So let's look over here. Four is less than six. Four sixths is less than six sixths. Remember is the same thing as six sixths. So this is not greater than one, so I would not select that. Nine fourths, well that's definitely larger than four fourths. That is greater than one and once again our numerator is larger than our denominator, so we know that we are greater than one. So I will select that one. And then we see again five halves. Two halves is equal to one, so five halves is definitely greater than one. So I like that one as well. And notice, five is greater than two and then we are already know we picked our two choices, but we can look at the other ones. Seven is less than eight, so seven eighths is less than eight eighths, so this is less than one. And three thirds, we've already talked about it, that's equal to one. So I like those two choices. Let's do another example that tackles it a little bit of a different way. It says, ""What, which fraction could represent ""Point A on the number line?"" And Point A is here. They don't tell us a lot about Point A, but all they do tell us by looking at the number line is that Point A is less than one. So which of these, another way to think about it, is less than one? All right, in order for it to be less than one the numerator has to be less than the denominator. Here our numerator is greater than the denominator. Seven fourths is definitely larger than four fourths. Remember, four fourths is equal to one. This right over here I could rewrite as four fourths. And so, seven fourths is going to be someplace, seven fourths is going to be someplace over there. So this is definitely not our choice. Two halves, well once again that's the same thing as one. That's right over there. So that's not our choice. What about five eighths? Well, five eighths, the numerator is less than the denominator. Eight eighths is equal to one, so that's that point again. So five eighths would be to the left of that. So that could be Point A. So I like that choice.",math_in-in-class-3rd-math-cbse_imp-fractions
" -  You're probably familiar with the general term factor. So if I were to say: What are the factors of 12, you could say: Well what are the whole numbers that I can multiply by another whole number to get 12? So for examples, you could say things like, well I could multiply one times 12 to get 12. So you could say that one is a factor of 12. You could even say that 12 is a factor of 12. You could say two times six is equal to 12, so you could say that two is a factor of 12 and that six is also a factor of 12. And of course three times four is also 12, so both three and four are factors of 12. So if you said well what are the factors of 12 and you've seen this before, well you could say: one, two, three, four, six, and 12, those are all factors of 12. And you could also phase it the other way around, so let me just give an example. So if I were to pick on three, I could say that three is a factor of 12. Or to phrase it slightly differently, I could say that 12 is divisible, 12 is divisible by three. Now what I wanna do in this video is extend this idea of being a factor or divisibility into the algebraic world. So for example, if I were to take 3xy. So this is a monomial with an integer coefficient. Three is an integer right over here. And if I were to multiply it with another monomial with an integer coefficient, I don't know, let's say times negative two X squared, Y to the third power, what is this going to be equal to? Well this would be equal to, if we multiply the coefficients, three times negative two is going to be negative six. X times X squared is X to the third power. And then Y times Y to the third is Y to the fourth power. And so what we could say is, if we wanted to say factors of negative six X to the third, Y to the fourth, we could say that 3xy is a factor of this just as an example; so let me write that down. We could write that 3xy is a factor of, is a factor of... of negative six X to the third power, Y to the fourth, or we could phrase that the other way around. We could say that negative six X to the third, Y to the fourth, is divisible by, is divisible by 3xy. So hopefully you're seeing the parallels. If I'm taking these two monomials with integer coefficients and I multiply 'em and I get this other, in this case, this other monomial, I could say that either one of these and there's actually other factors of this, but I could say either one of these is a factor of this monomial, or we could say that negative six X to the third, Y to the four is divisible by one of its factors. And we could even extend this to binomials or polynomials. For example, if I were to take, if I were to take, let me scroll down a little bit, whoops, if I were to take, let me say X plus three and I wanted to multiply it times X plus seven, we know that this is going to be equal to, if I were to write it as a trinomial, it's gonna be X times X, so X squared, and then it's gonna be three X plus seven X, so plus 10x; and if any of this looks familiar, we have a lot of videos where we go in detail of multiplying binomials like this. And then three times seven is 21. Plus 21. So because I multiplied these two, in this case binomials, or we could consider themselves to be polynomials, polynomials or binomials with integer coefficients. Notice the coefficients here, they're one, one. The constants here, they're all integers. Because I'm dealing with all integers here, we could say that either one of these binomials is a factor of this trinomial, or we could say this trinomial is divisible by either one of these. So let me write that down. So I could say, I'll just pick on X plus seven. We could say that X plus seven is a factor, is a factor of X squared plus 10x plus 21; or we could say that X squared plus 10x plus 21 is divisible by, is divisible by I could say X plus three or I could say X plus seven is divisible by, X plus seven. And the key is, is that both of these binomials, or even if we were dealing with polynomials, we are dealing with things that have integer, we're dealing with things that have integer coefficients.",math_algebra-home_alg-polynomials
" Solve the system of equations using any method. We have y is equal to 2 times the quantity x minus 4 squared plus 3. We also have y is equal to negative x squared plus 2 x minus 2. The solution-- it might be one, it might be none, or it might be two solutions-- to this system occurs for the x values that generate the same y values. There's the same x and y that satisfy both of these equations. In order to find the x values, they need to equal the same y values, so this y has to be that y value. So the solution is going to occur when this guy right here-- negative x squared plus 2x minus 2 is equal to that guy up there, or equal to 2 times x minus 4 squared plus 3. Now let's just try to solve for x. The left hand side-- we're going to have to multiply this out, so let's do that first. It's negative x squared plus 2x minus 2 is equal to. And on the right hand side, 2 times x minus 4 squared is x squared minus 8x plus 16 plus 3. This is going to be equal to 2x squared-- I'm just distributing the 2-- minus 16x plus 32 plus 3, which is equal to 2x squared minus 16x plus 35. That's, of course, going to be equal to this thing on the left hand side, negative x squared plus 2x minus 2. Let's just get rid of this whole thing from the left hand side all at once by adding x squared to both sides. We can all do it in one step. We're going to add x squared to both sides. Let's subtract 2x from both sides, and let's add 2 to both sides. On the left hand side, those cancel out, those cancel out, those cancel out. You're left with 0 is equal to 2x squared plus x squared is 3x squared. Negative 16x minus 2x is negative 18x, and then 35 plus 2 is 37. So we just have a plain vanilla quadratic equation right here. We might as well apply the quadratic formula here to try to solve it. Our solutions are going to be x is equal to negative b. Well, b is negative 18, so negative b is positive 18. It's 18 plus or minus the square root of 18 squared minus 4 times 3 times c-- times 37. All of that is over 2 times a-- 2 times 3, which is 6. Let's think about what this is going to be. Over here, we have 18 plus or minus the square root of-- let's just use a calculator. I could multiply it out but I think-- we have 18 squared minus 4 times 3 times 37, which is negative 120. It's 18 plus or minus the square root of negative 120. You might have even been able to figure out that this is negative. 4 times 3 is 12. 12 times 37 is going to be a bigger number than 18. Although it's not 100% obvious, but you might be able to just get the intuition there. We definitely end up with a negative number under the radical here. Now, if we're dealing with real numbers, there is no square root of negative 120. So there is no solution to this quadratic equation. There is no solution. If we wanted to, we could have just looked at the discrimit. The discrimit is this part-- b squared minus 4ac. We see the discrimit is negative, there's no solution, which means that these two guys-- these two equations-- never intersect. There is no solution to the system. There are no x values that when you put into both of these equations give you the exact same y value. Let's think a little bit about why that happened. This one is already in kind of our y-intercept form. It's an upward opening parabola, so it looks something like this. I'll do my best to draw it-- just a quick and dirty version of it. Let me draw my axes in a neutral color. Let's say that this right here is my y-axis, that right there is my x-axis. x and y. This vertex-- it's in the vertex form-- occurs when x is equal to 4 and y is equal to 3. So x is equal to 4 and y is equal to 3. It's an upward opening parabola. We have a positive coefficient out here. So this will look something like this. I don't know the exact thing, but that's close enough. Now, what will this thing look like? It's a downward opening parabola and we can actually put this in vertex form. Let me put the second equation in vertex form, just so we have it. So we have a good sense. So, y is equal to-- we could factor in a negative 1-- negative x squared minus 2x plus 2. Actually, let me put the plus 2 further out-- plus 2, all the way up out there. Then we could say, half of negative 2 is negative 1. You square it, so you have a plus 1 and then a minus 1 there. This part right over here, we can rewrite as x minus 1 squared, so it becomes negative x minus 1 squared. Let me just do it one step at a time. I don't want to skip steps. Negative x minus 1 squared minus 1 plus 2. So that's plus 1 out here. Or if we want to distribute the negative, we get y is equal to negative x minus 1 squared minus 1. Here the vertex occurs at x is equal to 1, y is equal to negative 1. The vertex is there, and this is a downward opening parabola. We have a negative coefficient out here on the second degree term, so it's going to look something like this. So as you see, they don't intersect. This vertex is above it and it opens upward. This is its minimum point. And it's above this guy's maximum point. So they will never intersect, so there is no solution to this system of equations.",math_math3_equations
" -  We are told that researchers suspect that myopia, or nearsightedness, is becoming more common over time. A study from the year 2000 showed 132 cases of myopia in 400 randomly selected people. A separate study from 2015 showed 228 cases in 600 randomly selected people. So what we're going to do in this video is do a hypothesis test to see if we have evidence to suggest the researcher suspicion that myopia is becoming more common over time. If at any point you are inspired, I encourage you to pause the video and try to work through things on your own, but here I go. I'm going to do it with you. So let's just start off by setting our null and alternative hypothesis. So remember, our null hypothesis, this would be that the known news here. So that would be that contrary to their suspicions, that myopia is not becoming more common. And so the way that we're measuring more common over time is we could look at the proportion of folks who have myopia in 2015 and compare that to the proportion in 2000. So our null hypothesis is that there's no difference. Is that the true proportion of folks who have myopia in 2015 is equal to the proportion of folks who have myopia in 2000. And then our alternative hypothesis, remember, they are, they suspect it's becoming more common over time. So that would be a situation where our true proportion in 2015 is greater than the true proportion in 2000. In this scenario, myopia would be becoming more common over time because 2015 happens after 2000. So before we even go about testing our null hypothesis, seeing if we can reject or not, which would suggest our alternative, you have to look at your conditions for inference. And we've done this many times before. You have your random condition, and it looks like we meet that because in both of the samples we have 400 randomly selected people, randomly selected people. So that looks good. Then you have your normal condition. And to meet your normal condition, your number of successes and failures in each of the samples have to be at least 10. And we see that that is the case. We have 132 successes so to speak, not that it's a success for someone to have myopia, but the way this is being constructed that would be a success. And then 400 minus 132 failures. In each case, either of those numbers would be greater than 10. And same thing for the sample from 2015, so we're meeting both of those. And then the last condition that we always talk about, is the independence condition. And two ways to get there, either you are sampling with replacement or you feel good that your sample size is no more than 10 percent of the population. And I think it is safe to say that even this larger sample of 600, that there is more than 6,000 people out there. And so I think it's reasonable to say that we're meeting that independence condition. Even though they're not making it explicit here. But it's good to always think about this. Now the next thing you wanna do in a hypothesis test is set your significance level, your alpha. And I'll set my significance level to 0.05. So we're not going to assume the null hypothesis and say, well what is the probability of getting a difference between 2015 and 2000 that is at least as large as the one that we got. And in that probability is less than our significance level then we would reject our null hypothesis and that would suggest the alternative. If that probability is greater than our significance level, then we fail to reject the null hypothesis and we fail to have evidence for the researchers suspicion. So let's move ahead with that. So what we wanna do, let's come up with a Z value, or a Z score. So our Z is going to be equal to a sample proportion in 2015 minus our sample proportion in 2000. All of that over a standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the difference between the sample proportions in 2015 and 2000. Now, this is going to be, and I will say approximately equal to, we can calculate this numerator exactly, but this denominator we are going to estimate. So this numerator is going to be, let's see, in 2015, I'll use some different colors, 2015 we have 228 cases out of 600. So it's 228 out of 600. And then in 2000, we have 132 cases out of 400. So minus 132 over 400. And then all of that over the square root. And what we use in the denominator here, under the radical sign, is we use the combined proportion. Could write that as P hat sub C. And the reason why we use the combined proportion, we talked about this in previous videos, is remember, when we do a hypothesis test, we assume that our null hypothesis is true. And if our null hypothesis is true there's no difference between our proportions in 2015 and 2000. And so to get a better estimate of the true proportion, well we should just add up our samples. So our sample size would be 600 plus 400 and the number of cases of myopia would be 228 plus 132. Plus 132. Which would get us to, what is this, 360 over 1000 which is equal to 0.36. And there, and we can use that inside the expression when we're trying to estimate our standard deviation of this sampling distribution. So this is going to be 0.36 times one minus 0.36, which would be 0.64 over the sample size in 2015, which is 600, plus 0.36 times 0.64 over the sample size in 2000, which is equal to 400. And let's see, before I even get my calculator out, I think I can simplify this a little bit. 228 over 600, 228 divided by 6 is going to be equal to 38, so this would be 0.38. Let's see, 132 divided by four would be 33, so this would be 0.33. And so our entire numerator is going to be 0.05, 0.05. And so noW I can put this into my calculator and I will get 0.05 divided by the square root of, let's see, I'm gonna have 0.36 times 0.64 divided by 600 plus 0.36 times 0.64 divided by 400 is going to get me approximately 1.61. So this is going to be approximately 1.61. And so one way to think about it is, the difference that we got between our sample proportions, between 2015 and 2000 of 0.05, but that is 1.61 standard deviations above our mean of our sampling distribution, if we assume that the null hypothesis is true. And so from this, we can calculate our P value. Remember, our P value, our P value is equal to the probability that our Z score is at least that big, is greater than or equal to 1.61. And one way to think about it, if you look at the sample distribution, I really could just look at any normal distribution now since we normalized for a Z, so we're looking at 1.61 standard deviations above the mean. So Z is equal to 1.61. So we're thinking about this area right over here. That would be our P value. And to help us with that, we can get out a Z table. And we see this Z table gives us the cumulative area up to some Z score, and so we would just have to whatever this gives us, we would just have to do one minus that. So if we go to 1.61, we get 0.9463. So it would be one minus 0.9463. Is equal to one minus 0.9463, which is equal to, let's see, it's 0.0537. And notice, this P value is ever so slightly higher than our significance level. But this is why we wanna set our significance level ahead of time. We don't wanna get tempted to say oh, I'm so close, let me just raise my significance level a little bit more so that I can reject my null hypothesis and then I can have something that I can tell my friends about. No, that would not be good science. That would not be good statistics. We have to be disciplined. So here, because our P value, our P value is greater than our significance level, even though it's very, it's by a very small amount, we fail to reject our null hypothesis. And another way to think about it, in terms of the context 1of the question, we can say that there is not 1enough evidence to suggest that myopia 1becoming more common over time. 1Myopia becoming more common over time. 1And we're done.",math_ap-statistics_two-sample-inference
"  We need to add 7.056 to 605.7 to 5.67. Now when you're adding any number, you always want to make sure you line up numbers in the same place. And especially when you're dealing with decimals, the easiest way to do that is to just line up the decimals. So let's do that. So the first number right here is 7.056. This second number right here is 605.7. And then this last number is 5.67. So now we have everything lined up. Everything that's in the ones place is below or above everything else in the ones place. Everything in the tenths place is below or above everything else in the tenths place, and so on and so forth. So we can add. So let's add it.  So you want to start off in the smallest place. So you start off here. This is the tenths, hundredths, thousandths place. This is literally 6 thousandths, and you want to add it to the other thousandths. There aren't any other thousandths. So you can view it two ways. You can just bring in this 6 down, or you could view this 605.7 as the same thing as 605.700. You can add as many zeroes to the right of this decimal, to the right of the 7, as you want, since we're sitting on the right side of the decimal, without changing its value. You can also do it here. This 5.67, you can write it as 5.670. When you write it like this, and you have 6 plus 0 plus 0 is 6. And you keep going. 5 plus 0 plus 7 is 12. You write the 2 in the hundredths place, and carry the 1. 1 plus 0 plus 7 is 8, plus 6 is 14. Write the 4, regroup the 1 into the ones place. 1 plus 7 is 8. 8 plus 5 is 13. 13 plus 5 is 18. This is 18. Carry or regroup the 1. 1 plus 0 is just 1. And then finally. You have the 6 in the hundreds place. Nothing gets added to it, so you can just bring down that 6 and it's right there. And you don't want to forget the decimal. And so when you add the numbers you get 618.426, or 618 and 426 thousandths. And we're done. ",math_6th-engage-ny_engage-6th-module-2
" -  We have some type of study described here. I encourage you to pause this video, and think about whether this is an observational study, it's an experiment, or it's a sample study. And also think about whether it was conducted well. All right, now let's do this together. A group of doctors was interested in comparing the effectiveness of placebo pills and real pills in treating migraines. Placebo pills are pills that look just like the regular pill, and from a patient's point of view, they don't know which on they're getting. The reason why we do this in studies is because there's something called a placebo effect. Often times, just by taking something that you think is good for you, some medicine that you think might help you, it actually does help you. We can think about why the placebo effect happens, but this is well documented. So when people are trying to test medicine, they wanna say, well, does this have an effect above and beyond the placebo effect. That's why they are putting them in these two, that's why they're comparing the real pills to the placebo pills. They randomly assigned a group of 300 patients suffering from migraines into two groups. So they have their 300, they have their 300 patients right over here. And they're randomly putting them into the placebo group. Placebo group, or the real pill group. One group was given a real pill, oh no, we already read that. Both groups were told which kind of pill they got. That is sketchy because the whole point about a placebo is that you think you got the real thing, or you think you might have gotten the real thing. If you're told you got a placebo, that tends to undermine the placebo effect. If you're just told you're given a sugar pill, well, then the impact, well anyway. This is, that right over there is definitely bad practice. So let's keep going over here. Before taking the pills, and a day afterwards, the patients were asked to fill out questionnaires regarding their condition. Then, the doctors analyzed the overall changes in questionnaires for each group and compared them. All right, so first of all, what type of study is this? Well, we're taking our groups, we are randomly putting them into two different groups. You can call the placebo group maybe the control group. And then you're putting the real pill as you're actual experimental group. So this is a classic experiment. This is a classic experiment. You're trying to establish a causal relationship. You wanna see whether this real pill actually makes migraines better. Migraines better. So does it actually do it, and does it actually do it better than a placebo? And you're randomly putting the people in both groups to try to distribute any confounding variables that there might be there. This is clearly an experiment. Now the other options, you might have said, well, this may be an observational study? Remember, an observational study, observational, that's more of where you look at a population, you look at a group, you ask them a bunch of questions often, and you see if they're correlations between two variables. So variable one, and variable two, and you're able to make some type of correlational statement. You're not trying to get at causality. In a sample study, a sample study, this is just you trying to estimate a parameter for the entire population. So a sample study might of been, of the entire population what percentage gets migraines. You can't talk to the entire population, maybe the entire population is millions of people, so you take a sample of say 100 people. And you ask them, do you get migraines? Then you say, okay, that percentage of our sample that get migraines, that's a good estimate for the parameter. What percentage of my entire population actually gets migraines? So this was clearly an experiment. Now the next question is, well, was this experiment conducted well? Even when I read it, I was bothered by both groups were told which kind of pill they got. That completely defeats the purpose of a placebo. The placebo effect is, hey, I think I'm taking something good for me, and it's been documented that when you think you're taking a pill that helps you, it often times does help you. And so when someone's coming up with a new medicine, it better perform, or it better be more effective than just that placebo. I don't like the fact that, this is a very bad study to tell both groups what kind of pill they got. You actually should tell neither group which type of pill they got.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-4
" - [Sal] Let's do some practice examples from our intro to slope y intercept exercise. What is the slope of y is equal to negative four x minus three? So you might already recognize, this is in slope intercept form. Just as a reminder, slope intercept form is y is equal to mx plus b, where the coefficient on this x term right over here, that is our slope, and then this constant right over here, that is going to give you your y intercept. So if they're saying, what is the slope here? Well I just need to figure out, what is the coefficient on this x term? And you can see that the coefficient here is a negative four. So that is going to be our m, that is going to be our slope. Now just as a reminder, you have to make sure that it's solved in this way, that is is solved for y, y is equal to something times x minus three, so that's our slope. Let's do another one of these. So we're asked, what is the y intercept of y is equal to negative three x minus two? So once again we already have it in slope intercept form. It's already been solved for y. It's of the form y is equal to mx plus b, where m, our slope, is given right over here, negative three. But they're not asking for our slope, they're asking for the y intercept. Well the y intercept is given by b here, so b is negative two. Pay close attention to the sign here. So b is equal to negative two. But when I look at these choices, I don't see a b is equal to negative two, so what are they talking about? Well a y intercept is, what is the y value when x is equal to zero? And you could see that here, if x was equal to zero then that term goes away and y is equal to b. So if you want to know the point where the graph described by this equation intercepts the y axis, well it's going to be what is y when x is equal to zero? Well when x is equal to zero, y is equal to negative two. And you could see that in our original equation, again. If x were zero, this term would go away, and y would be equal to negative two. So zero, comma, negative two. So it would be that choice right over there. On Khan Academy obviously you just have to click on that, you don't have to shade it in. Let's do one more. Complete the equation of the line whose slope is five, and y intercept is zero, comma, four. So once again the general form is y is equal to our slope times x, if I want to put it in slope intercept form, plus our y intercept. Well they're telling us, our slope is five. Whose slope is five. So we know that m is going to be five. And they tell us that the y intercept is zero, four. So the y intercept, b, that is the value of y when x is equal to zero. So the value of y when x equals zero is this four right over here. So that is going to be four. So I could say y is equal to five times x plus four. And when you're actually entering it on Khan Academy, you would just type it in, or if you're using the app you would use it with your finger. And I always make the mistake of writing y equals, and I type in y equals five x plus four. Notice they already gave you the y equals right over there. That's all you have to do, recognize the slope, the y intercept, and then remember what the slope intercept form actually is.",math_algebra-home_alg-linear-eq-func
" -  What we are going to do in this video is talk a little bit about lipids. Now, a lot of times, lipids are strongly associated with fats, and that's not incorrect. Fats are lipids, but not all lipids are fats. A better definition or a better association for lipids would be a class of molecules that you often see in biological systems that are not so water soluble. And I didn't say outright hydrophobic, which means not attracted to water, because there are definitely lipids that have parts that are hydrophobic, that are trying to get away from the water. But there is other parts that are hydrophilic, that like the water, that would be attracted to water molecules. Now, in terms of roles they play in the body, and we can think of fat molecules here, well, they definitely play a role in terms of energy storage. Whenever I look at my belly, I just like to think of all that energy that is there covering my six-pack. They could be involved in signaling. In future videos, we're going to study hormones, and hormones are nothing but molecules that help transmit a signal from one part of the body to another part of the body. And many of these hormones are lipids. They're also involved in membranes. So a lot of the time in biology, we're gonna talk about cellular membranes and how they're formed with these phospholipids. And we'll see these phospholipids, in particular, have one end that's trying to get away from the water and another end that is attracted to the water. And that's actually what makes them good for membranes. Just going back to fats, let's actually take a look at what some of these lipid molecules look like. So this right over here is an example of a fat molecule, but the general structure you're going to have is these three fatty acids. So that's one right over there, one fatty acid, two fatty acids, and three fatty acids that are connected to a glycerol. And don't worry too much about the words here. You'll study them more when you get to an organic chemistry class. But that's where this word triglyceride comes from, tri- for your three fatty acids and -glyceride from a glycerol. And triglyceride is, in fact, another word for fat. And what makes a triglyceride not so soluble in water? Look at these long hydrocarbon chains where you just essentially have a bunch of carbons and hydrogens. Those parts, remember, things that are soluble in water, they tend to be polar molecules, things that have a partial charge on one end or another or even a full charge. But when we look at these hydrocarbon chains, they tend to not have these partial charges on one side or another, and so that doesn't make them so soluble in water. And another word that you sometimes hear associated with fats, saturated or unsaturated fat. That's really referring to what's going on on these hydrocarbon chains. If the carbons are as bonded to as many hydrogens as they can, well, then you're talking about a saturated fat. It's saturated with hydrogens. If it's not bounded, if it, in theory, it could bond to more hydrogens because it has some double bonds in there, well, then it's unsaturated. Maybe in a future video, we'll talk about the health issues of saturated versus unsaturated fat. Sometimes in popular culture, fat gets a bad name because everyone's trying to get their six-packs or whatever else, but it's very important to realize that without fats you would die. Many vitamins, which are not so soluble in water, making them, in fact, lipids, need fat in order to be absorbed into the body properly. But as I also mentioned, all lipids are not fats. Here are more examples of lipids, and I'm not gonna go into detail into their molecular structure. But you see something similar here. They all have long chains of hydrocarbons that aren't so soluble in water. These parts right over here would be hydrophobic, hydrophobic. But what's interesting, especially about this sphingomyelin, which is involved in your myelin sheath in the brain, it helps electrically insulate neurons, it's also involved in membranes, it makes up a substantial part of the phospholipids in membranes, is that this sphingomyelin right over here has a part that actually is hydrophilic. And as we'll see later on, that's what makes things, molecules like this, phospholipids, this is a sphingophospholipid, makes them good for membrane structures. Because the part that's attracted to the water could be on the outside, and the part that's not attracted to the water could be on the inside. And so you can form these membranes that a cross-section of which would look something like this where the circular parts are the part that want, the parts that want to be around the water, while these tails right over here, these are the hydrophobic chains that want to go away from the water. And this is, in fact, what cellular membranes actually look like if you were zoom really, really, really far in. I'll leave you there. Between lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, we've really covered the major macromolecules that you will see in biological systems. Once again, what makes them macromolecules? Well, they can be composed of many, many, many, many, many atoms. They aren't small molecules.",science_high-school-biology_hs-biology-foundations
" So we've got the function, f of x is equal to x squared. And what I'm concerned with, is finding the area under the curve, y is equal to f of x, so that's my y axis. This is my, my, x axis. Then let me draw my function. My function looks like this. At least in the, in the first quadrant. That's where I'll graph it for now. I could also graph it, obviously in the second quadrant. But, what I care about is the area under this curve and above the positive x axis, between, between x equals 1 and x equals 4, x equals 4. And I'm tired of approximating areas. I wanna find the exact area under this curve above the x axis. And the way we denote the exact area under the curve, this little brown shaded area, is using the definite integral. The definite integral from 1 to 4 of f of x, dx. And the way that, or the way I conceptualize where this notation comes from, is we imagine a bunch of infinite, an infinite number of infinitely thin rectangles that we sum up to find this area. Let me draw one of those infinitely thin rectangles, maybe not so infinitely thin. So, let me draw it like this. So, that would be one of the rectangles, that would be another rectangle. This should be reminiscent of a Riemann sum. In fact, that's where the Riemann integral comes from. Think of a Riemann sum where you have an infinite number of these rectangles, where the width of each of the rectangles. This is how I conceptualize it, is dx, and the height of this rectangle is the function evaluated at an x that's within this interval right over here. And so, this part right over here is the area of one of those rectangles, and we were summing them all up. And this kind of an elongated s, reminiscent of a sigma for summing. We're summing up the infinite number, of those infinitely thin rectangles, or the areas of those infinitely thin rectangles between 1 and 4. So that's where the notation of the definite integral comes from. But we still haven't done anything. We've just written some notation that says the exact area of the un- Between 1 and 4, under the curve f of x, and above the x axis. In order to actually do anything really productive with this, we have to turn to the second fundamental theorem of calculus, sometimes called part two of the fundamental theorem of calculus. >> Which tells us, that if f has an antiderivative, so if we have the antiderivative of f, so f of x is derivative, derivative of some function capital F of x, or another way of saying it is, f, capital F of x is the antiderivative, antiderivative of lower case f of x. Then I can evaluate this thing, and we do a whole video on conceptually understanding why this makes sense. We could evaluate this, by evaluating the antiderivative of f, or an antiderivative of f, at 4. And from that, subtract the antiderivative evaluated at 1. So, let's do it for this particular case right over here. So we are taking, I'll just rewrite this statement. Instead of writing f of x, I'll write x squared. So, the definite integral from 1 to 4 of x squared dx. Well, we're just gonna have to figure out what the antiderivative is. So if f of x is equal to x squared, what is capital F of x equal to? What is the antiderivative? Well, you might remember from your power rule, that if you take the derivative with respect to x of x to the third, you are going to get 3x squared, which is pretty darn close to x squared except for this factor of 3. So, let's divide both sides by 3. Let's divide both sides by 3, and you get the derivative of x to the third divided by 3 is indeed x squared. Or, you can say this is the same thing as the derivative with respect to x of, x to the third over 3. Take the derivative of this. It'll be 3 times one third. And then you'll decrement the power, it'll just be x squared. So, this right over here, once again, is x squared. It's just equal to, just equal to x squared. So, in this case, our capital F of x, our antiderivative, is x to the third, x to the third over 3. And so we just have to evaluate that at 4 and at 1, and sometimes the way we would, the, the notation we would use is, we'll say that the antiderivative is x to the third over 3, and we're going to evaluate it, the one I, I always just like to write the numbers up here, at 4 and from that subtracted, evaluated at 1. Sometimes you'll see people write a little line here too, we'll say we're evaluate it at 4 and then at 1. But I'll just do it without the line. If we're gonna evaluate this thing at 4 and from that subtract it, subtract it evaluated at 1, so this going to be equal to 4 to the third power is 64, so it's going to be 64 over 3. Let me color code it, this is, this right over here, is this, right over there and then from that, we're going to subtract this business evaluated at one. Well, when you evaluate it at 1, you get 1 to the third is one over 3. You get one third. So just to be clear, this is this right over there. And then we are ready to just subtract these fractions. 64 over 3, minus one third, is equal to 63 over 3. And 3 goes into 63 exactly, exactly 21 times. So, whatever the units are, the area of this brown area is 21 square units.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-definite-integrals
" A newborn calf weighs 40 kilograms. Each week its weight increases by 5%. Let W be the weight in kilograms of the calf after t weeks. Is W a linear function or an exponential function? So, if W were a linear function, that means that every week that goes by, the weight would increase by the same amount. So let's say that every week that went by, the weight increases ... Or, really, they're talking about mass here. The mass increased by 5 kilograms. Then we'd be dealing with a linear function. But they're not saying that the weight increases by 5 kilograms. They're saying by 5%. After one week it'll be 1.05 times 40 kilograms. After another week it'll be 1.05 times that, it'll be 5 percent more. After the next week it'll be 1.05 times that. So really, if we really think about this function, it's going to be 40 kilograms times 1.05 to the t power. We're compounding by 5% every time. We're increasing by a factor of 1.05. Or another way of thinking about it, by a factor of 105% every week. Because we have that growth by a factor, not just by a constant number, that tells us that this is going to be an exponential function. So let's see which if these choices describe that. This function is linear, no, we don't have to even read that. This function is linear, nope. This function is exponential because W increases by a factor of 5 each time t increases by 1. No, that's not right. We're increasing by 5%. Increasing by 5% means you're 1.05 times as big as you were before increasing. So it's really this function is exponential because W increases by a factor of 1.05 each time t increases by 1. That, right over there, is the right answer. Let's try 1 more of these. Determine whether the quantity described is changing in a linear fashion or an exponential fashion. Fidel has a rare coin worth $550. Each year the coin's value increases by 10%. Well, this is just like the last example we saw. We're increasing every year that goes by as we increase by a factor of 1.1. If we grow by 10%, that's increasing by a factor of 110% or 1.1. So this is definitely exponential. If it was increasing $10 per year, then it would be linear. But here we're increasing by a percentage. Your uncle bought a car for 130,000 Mexican pesos. Each year the value of the car decreases by 10,000 pesos. So here we're not multiplying by a factor, we're decreasing by a fixed amount. 1 year goes by, we're at 120,000. 2 years goes by we're at 110,000. So this is definitely a linear ... This can be described by a linear model. The number of wild hogs in Arkansas increases by a factor of 3 every 5 years. So a factor of 3 every 5 years. They're not saying it increases by 3 hogs every 5 years. We're multiplying by 3 every 5 years. So this is definitely ... This one right over here is going to be exponential. Then, finally, you work as a waiter at a restaurant. You earn $50 in tips every day you work. Well, this is super ... This should jump out as very linear. Every day you work, another $50. Work 1 day, $50. 2 days, $100. So forth and so on. They're not saying that you earned 50 times as much as the day before. They're not saying that you earned 50% more. They're saying that you're increasing by a fixed quantity. So this is going to be a linear model.",math_math1_exp-func
" Let's do some more of these classic age word problems. So we're told that William is 4 times as old as Ben. 12 years ago, William was 7 times as old as Ben. How old is Ben now? Once again, it's a good idea to try to do this on your own first, and then I'll work through it. What's the unknown here? Well, the unknown here is how old is Ben now. So let's set a variable equal to that, and we do x or y. But since Ben starts with a b, let's use b for Ben. So let's let b equal Ben's current age, Ben's age now. Let's see how all of this other information relates to Ben's current age, and then maybe we can set up some equation and then solve for things. I'll do it a little bit more structured in this one. You could have done many of the problems we've been working on in this way. Let's think about Ben, and then let's think about William. I'll do William in blue here. So let's think about William. And then there's two points in time we're talking about. We're talking about now, today, and we're going to talk about 12 years ago. Over here, let's call that now. This will be our now column, and then this will be our 12 years ago. Let's see what we can fill in here. What is Ben's age now? Well, we just defined that as the variable b. That's the unknown. That's what we have to figure out. So let's just stick that there. That's just going to be b. Well, what's Ben's age 12 years ago? So maybe we want to express it in terms of b. If he's b now, 12 years ago, he was just b minus 12. Fair enough. Now what is William's age today? Well, this first sentence gave us the information. William is 4 times as old as Ben. And we can assume that they're talking about today, is 4 times as old as Ben. So if Ben is b, William is going to be 4b. And so how old was William 12 years ago? Well, if he's 4b right now, 12 years ago, he'll just be 12 less than that. So he's 4b now. 12 years ago, he was 4b minus 12. So that's kind of interesting. But we haven't quite yet made use of the second statement. This is William 12 years ago. 12 years ago, William was 7 times as old as Ben. So 12 years ago, this number is going to be 7 times this number. Or another way to think about, take this number and multiply it by 7, and you're going to get this number. 12 years ago, Ben's age is 1/7 of William's age, or William's age is 7 times Ben's age. So let's see if we can set that up as an equation. We can have-- let me write this down-- 7 times Ben's age 12 years ago, b minus 12, is going to be equal to William's age. And it seems like we've done the hard part. We've set up the equation. Now we just use a little bit of our algebraic tools to solve for b. So let's do that. The first thing we might want to do, we could distribute the 7, so 7 times b, 7 times, essentially, a negative 12. We have 7b minus 7 times 12-- let's see. That's 84-- is going to be equal to 4b minus 12. This whole expression is literally 7 times Ben's age 12 years ago. Now what can we do to solve this? Well, we can subtract 4b from both sides, so let's do that. I could do two steps at the same time. Well, actually, let's just keep it simple. I'm going to subtract 4b from both sides. That goes away. On the right-hand side, I have a negative 12. On the left-hand side, I am left with 7b minus 4b is 3b. And then I still have a minus 84. Well, I want to get rid of this negative 84, this minus 84 on the left-hand side. So let's add 84 to both sides. On the left-hand side, I'm just left with 3b. And on the right-hand side, I have negative 12 plus 84, or 84 minus 12, which is 72. Now if I want to solve for b, I just have to divide both sides of that equation by 3. And so I am left with b is equal to-- and now we have our drum roll-- 72/3. And you might be able to do that in your head. It would be 24, I believe. You could work it out on paper if you have trouble. Let's just do it real quick. 72, 3 goes into 7 two times. You get a 2 times 3 is 6, subtract, you bring down the 2, 3 goes into 12 four times. So b is equal to 24. Going back to our question, what is Ben's age now? It is 24. And let's verify that this is actually the case. They're telling us that William is 4 times as old as Ben. So what is William's current age? Well, 4 times 24 is 96, so William is a senior. We should call him Mr. William. He is 96 years old. Maybe he's Ben's grandfather or great-grandfather. Then they say 12 years ago, William-- well, 12 years ago, William was 84 years old. So he was 84 years old. They say that's 7 times as old as Ben. Well, 12 years ago, if he's 24 now, Ben was 12. And indeed, 84 is 7 times 12, so it all worked out.",math_8th-grade-illustrative-math_unit-4-linear-equations-and-linear-systems
" I think you've probably heard the word divide before, where someone tells you to divide something up. Divide the money between you and your brother or between you and your buddy. And it essentially means to cut up something. So let me write down the word divide. Let's say that I have 4 quarters. Do my best to draw the quarters. If I have 4 quarters just like that. That's my rendition of George Washington on the quarters. And let's say there's two of us and we're going to divide the quarters between us. So this is me right here. Let me try my best to draw me. So that's me right there. Let's see, I have a lot of hair. And then this is you right there. Do my best. So you're bald. You have side burns. Maybe you have a little bit of a beard. I want to get too focused on the drawing. So that's you, that's me, and we're going to divide these 4 quarters between the 2 of us. So notice, we have 4 quarters and we're going to divide between the 2 of us. There are 2 of us. And I want to stress the number 2. So we're going to divide 4 quarters by 2. We're going to divide it between the 2 of us. And you've probably done something like this. What happens? Well, each of us are going to get 2 quarters. So let me divide it. We're going to divide it into 2. Essentially what I did do is I take the 4 quarters and I divide it into 2 equal groups. And that's what division is. We cut up this group of quarters into 2 equal groups. So when you divide 4 quarters into 2 groups, so this was 4 quarters right there. And you want to divide it into 2 groups. This is group 1. Group 1 right here. And this is group 2 right here. How many numbers are in each group? Or how many quarters are in each group? Well, in each group I have 1, 2 quarters. Let me use a brighter color. I have 1, 2 quarters in each group. 1 quarter and 2 quarters in each group. So to write this out mathematically, I think this is something that you've done, probably as long as you've been splitting money between you and your siblings and your buddies. Actually, let me scroll over a little bit, so you can see my entire picture. How do we write this mathematically? We can write that 4 divided by-- so this 4. Let me use the right colors. So this 4, which is this 4, divided by the 2 groups, these are the 2 groups: group 1 and this is group 2 right here. So divided into 2 groups or into 2 collections. 4 divided by 2 is equal to-- when you divide 4 into 2 groups, each group is going to have 2 quarters in it. It's going to be equal to 2. And I just wanted to use this example because I want to show you that division is something that you've been using all along. And another important, I guess, takeaway or thing to realize about this, is on some level this is the opposite of multiplication. If I said that I had 2 groups of 2 quarters I would multiply the 2 groups times the 2 quarters each and I would say I would then have 4 quarters. So on some level these are saying the same thing. But just to make it a little bit more concrete in our head, let's do a couple of more examples. Let's do a bunch of more examples. So let's write down, what is 6 divided by-- I'm trying to keep it nice and color coded. 6 divided by 3, what is that equal to? Let's just draw 6 objects. They can be anything. Let's say I have 6 bell peppers. I won't take too much trouble to draw them. Well, that's not what a bell pepper looks like, but you get the idea. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And I'm going to divide it by 3. And one way that we can think about that is that means I want to divide my 6 bell peppers into 3 equal groups of bell peppers. You could kind of think of it if 3 people are going to share these bell peppers, how many do each of them get? So let's divide it into 3 groups. So that's our 6 bell peppers. I'm going to divide it into 3 groups. So the best way to divide it into 3 groups is I can have 1 group right there, 2 groups, or the second group right there, and then, the third group. And then each group will have exactly how many bell peppers? They'll have 1, 2. 1, 2. 1, 2 bell peppers. So 6 divided by 3 is equal to 2. So the best way or one way to think about it is that you divided the 6 into 3 groups. Now you could view that a slightly different way, although it's not completely different, but it's a good way to think about it. You could also think of it as 6 divided by 3. And once again, let's say I have raspberries now-- easier to draw. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And here, instead of dividing it into 3 groups like we did here. This was 1 group, 2 group, 3 groups. Instead of dividing into 3 groups, what I want to do is say well, if I'm dividing 6 divided by 3, I want to divide it into groups of 3. Not into 3 groups. I want to divide it into groups of 3. So how many groups of 3 am I going to have? Well, let me draw some groups of 3. So that is one group of 3. And that is two groups of 3. So if I take 6 things and I divide them into groups of 3, I will end up with 1, 2 groups. So that's another way to think about division. And this is an interesting thing. When you think about these two relations, you'll see a relationship between 6 divided by 3 and 6 divided by 3. Let me do that right here. What is 6 divided by 2 when you think of it in this context right here? 6 divided by 2, when you do it like that-- let me draw 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. When we think about 6 divided by 2 in terms of dividing it into 2 groups, what we can end up is we could have 1 group like this and then 1 group like this, and each group will have 3 elements. It'll have 3 things in it. So 6 divided by 2 is 3. Or you could think of it the other way. You could say that 6 divided by 2 is-- you're taking 6 objects: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And your dividing it into groups of 2 where each group has 2 elements. And that on some level is an easier thing to do. If each group has 2 elements, well, that's the 1 right there. They don't even have to be nicely ordered. This could be one group right there and that could be the other group right there. I don't have to draw them all stacked up. These are just groups of 2. But how many groups do I have? I have 1, 2, 3. I have 3 groups. But notice something, it's no coincidence that 6 divided by 3 is 2 and 6 divided by 2 is 3. Let me write that down. We get 6 divided by 3 is equal to 2 and 6 divided by 2 is equal to 3. And the reason why you see this relation where you can kind of swap this 2 and this 3 is because 2 times 3 is equal to 6. Let's say I have 2 groups of 3. Let me draw 2 groups of 3. So that's 1 group of 3 and then here's another group of 3. So 2 groups of 3 is equal to 6. 2 times 3 is equal to 6. Or you could think of it the other way if I have 3 groups of 2. So that's 1 group of 2 right there. I have another group of 2 right there. And then I have a 3 group of 2 right there. What is that equal to? 3 groups of 2-- 3 times 2. That's also equal to 6. So 2 times 3 is equal to 6. 3 times 2 is equal to 6. We saw this in the multiplication video that the order doesn't matter. But that's the reason why if you want to divide it, if you want to go the other way-- if you have 6 things and you want to divide it into groups of 2, you get 3. If you have 6 and you want to divide into groups of 3, you get 2. Let's do a couple of more problems. I think it'll really make sense about what division is all about. Let's do an interesting one. Let's do 9 divided by 4. So if we think about 9 divided by 4, let me draw 9 objects. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Now when you divide by 4, for this problem, I'm thinking about dividing it into groups of 4. So if I want to divide it into groups of 4, let me try doing that. 1So here is one group of 4. 1I just picked any of them right like that. 1That's one group of 4. 1Then here's another group of 4 right there. 1And then I have this left over thing. 1Maybe we could call it a remainder, where I can't put 1this one into a group of 4. 1When I'm dividing by 4 I can only cut up the 19 into groups of 4. 1So the answer here, and this is a new concept for you maybe, 9 1divided by 4 is going to be 2 groups. 1I have one group here and another group here, and then 1I have a remainder of 1. 1I have 1 left over that I wasn't able to do with. 1Remainder-- that says remainder 1. 19 divided by 4 is 2 remainder 1. 1If I asked you what 12 divided by 4 is, so let me do 12. 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 1So let me write that down. 112 divided by 4. 1So I want to divide these 12 objects-- maybe 1they're apples or plums. 1And divide them into groups of 4. 1So let me see if I can do that. 1So this is one group of 4 just like that. 1This is another group of 4 just like that. 1And this is pretty straightforward. 1And then I have a third group of 4 just like that. 1And there's nothing left over like I had before. 1I can exactly divide 12 objects into 3 groups of 4. 11, 2, 3 groups of 4. 1So 12 divided by 4 is equal to 3. 1And we can do the exercise that we saw on the previous video. 1What is 12 divided by 3? 1Let me do a new color. 112 divided by 3. 1Now based on what we've learn so far we say, that should just 1be 4 because 3 times 4 is 12. 1But let's prove it to ourselves. 1So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 20, 11, 12. 1Let's divide it into groups of 3. 1And I'm going to make them a little strange looking just 1so you see that you don't always have to do it into 1nice, clean columns. 1So that's a group of 3 right there. 112 divided by 3. 1Let's see, here is another group of 3 just like that. 1And then, maybe I'll take this group of 3 like that. 1And I'll take this group of 3. 1There was obviously a much easier way of dividing it up 1then doing these weird l-shaped things, but I want to show 1you it doesn't matter. 1You're just dividing it into groups of 3. 1And how many groups do we have? 1We have one group. 1Then we have our second group right here. 1And then we have our third group right there. 1And then we have-- let me do it in a new color. 1And then we have our fourth group right there. 1So we have exactly 4 groups. 1And when I say there was an easier way to divide it, the 1easier way was obviously, maybe not obviously-- if I want to 1divide these into groups of 3 I could have just done 1, 12, 3, 4 groups of 3. 1Either of these I'm dividing the 12 objects 1into packets of 3. 1You can imagine them that way. 1Let's do another one that maybe has a remainder. 1Let's see. 1What is 14 divided by 5? 1So let's draw 14 objects. 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 14. 114 objects. 1And I'm going to divide it into groups of 5. 1Well, the easiest thing is there's one group right there, 1two groups right there. 1But then this last one, I only have 4 left, so I can't 1make another group of 5. 1So the answer here is I can make 2 groups of 5 and I'm 1going to have a remainder-- r for remainder-- of 4. 12 remainder 4. 1Now, once you get enough practice, you're not always 1going to be wanting to draw these circles and dividing 1them up like that. 1Although that would not be incorrect. 1So another way to think about this type of problem is to 1say, well, 14 divided by 5, how do I figure that out? 1Actually, another way of writing this and no 1harm in showing you. 1I could say 14 divided by 5 is the same thing as 15 divided 1by-- this sign right-- divided by 5. 1And what you do is you say, well, let's see. 1How many times does 5 go into 14? 1Well, let's see. 15 times and you kind of do multiplication 1tables in your head. 15 times 1 is equal to 5. 15 times 2 is equal to 10. 1So that's still less than 14, so 5 goes at least two times. 15 times 3 is equal to 15. 1Well that's bigger than 14, so I have to go back here. 1So 5 only goes two times. 1So it goes 2 times. 12 times 5 is 10. 1And then you subtract. 1You say 14 minus 10 is 4. 1And that's the same remainder as right here. 1Well, I could divide 5 into 14 exactly two times, which 1would get us 2 groups of 5. 1Which is essentially just 10. 1And we still have the 4 left over. 1Let me do a couple of more just to really make sure you get 1this stuff really, really, really, really well. 1Let me write it in that notation. 1Let's say I do 8 divided by 2. 1And I could also write this as 8-- so I want 1to know what that is. 1That's a question mark. 1I could also write this as 8 divided by 2. 1And the way I do either of these, I'll draw the circles in 1the second, but the way I do it without drawing the circles, I 1say, well, 2 times 1 is equal to 2. 1So that definitely goes into 8, but maybe I can think of a 1larger number that goes into-- that when I multiply it 1by 2 still goes into 8. 12 times 2 is equal to 4. 1That's still less than 8. 1So 2 times 3 is equal to 6. 1Still less than 8. 12 times-- oh, something weird happened to my pen. 12 times 4 is exactly equal to 8. 1So 2 goes into 8 four times. 1So I could say 2 goes into 8 four times. 1Or 8 divided by 2 is equal to 4. 1We can even draw our circles. 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1I drew them messy on purpose. 1Let's divide them into groups of 2. 1I have one group of 2, two groups of 2, three groups 1of 2, four groups of 2. 1So if I have 8 objects, divide them into groups of 2, 1you have four groups. 1So 8 divided by 2 is 4. 1Hopefully you found that helpful.",math_arithmetic-home_multiply-divide
" Let g of x equal negative 4x plus 7. What is the value of the limit as x approaches negative 1 of all of this? So before we think about this, let's just visualize the line. And then we can think about what they're asking here. So let me draw some axes here. So this is my vertical axis and this is my horizontal axis. And let's say this is my x-axis. We'll label that the x-axis. I'll graph g of x. g of x is going to have a positive-- I guess you would say y-intercept. or vertical axis intercept. It's going to have a slope of negative 4, so it's going to look something like this. Let me draw my best. So it's going to look something like that. And we already know the slope here is going to be negative 4. We get that right from this slope intercept form of the equation, slope is equal to negative 4. And they ask us, what is the limit as x approaches negative 1 of all of this kind of stuff? So let's plot the point negative 1. So when x is negative 1, so that's this point right over here. And this point right over here would be the point negative 1, g of negative 1. Let me label everything else. So I could call this my y-axis. I could call this graph. This is the graph of y is equal to g of x. So what they're doing right over here is they're finding the slope between an arbitrary point x, g of x, and this point right over here. So let's do that. So let's take another x. So let's say this is x. This would be the x, g of x. And this expression right over here, notice it is your change in the vertical axis. That would be your g of x. Let me make it this way. So this would be your change in the vertical axis. That would be g of x minus g of negative 1. And then that's over-- actually, let me write it this way so you can keep track of the colors-- minus g of negative 1, all of that over your change in the horizontal axis. Well, your change in the horizontal axis is this distance, which is the same thing as this distance. Notice your change in vertical over change in horizontal, change in vertical over change in horizontal, reviewing the green point as the endpoint. So it's going to be x minus negative 1. And this is the exact same expression. These are the exact same expression. You can simplify them, minus negative 1, and this becomes plus. This could become a plus 1. But these are the exact same expression. So this is the expression, really, for the slope between negative 1 and g of negative 1 and an arbitrary x. Well, we already know that no matter what x you pick, the slope between x, g of , and this point right over here is going to be constant. It's going to be the slope of the line. It's going to be equal to negative 4. This thing is going to be equal to negative 4. It's going to be equal to negative 4. Doesn't matter how close x gets, and weather x comes from the right or whether x comes from the left. So this thing, taking the limit of this, this just gets you to negative 4. It's really just the slope of the line. So even if you were to take the limit as x approaches negative 1, as x gets closer and closer and closer to negative 1, well then, these points are just going to get closer and closer and closer. But every time you calculate the slope, it's just going to be the slope of the line, which is negative 4. Now, you could also do this algebraically. And let's try to do it algebraically. So let's actually just take the limit as x approaches negative 1 of g of x. Well, they already told us what g of x is. It is negative 4x plus 7, minus g of negative 1. So that's minus, what is g of negative 1? Negative 1 times 4 is positive 4. Positive 4 plus 7 is 11. All of that over x plus 1, all of that over x plus 1. And that's really x minus negative 1, is you want to think of it that way. But I'll just write x plus 1 this way here. So this is going to be equal to the limit as x approaches negative 1 of, in our numerator-- let's see. 7 minus 11 is negative 4. We can factor out a negative 4. It's a negative 4 times x plus 1, all of that over x plus 1. And then since we're just trying to find the limit as x approaches negative 1, so we can cancel those out. And this is going to be non-zero for any x value other than negative 1. And so this is going to be equal to negative 4. So either way, we get negative 4. But if you just realize, hey, this is a line. It's going to have a constant slope. This is just the slope of between some arbitrary point on the line and the point negative 1, 11, really. Negative 1, 11, you say, well that's just going to the same as the slope of a line. It's negative 4.",math_old-differential-calculus_derivative-intro-dc
" For us modern humans with our easy access to the local supermarket it's easy to forget that throughout human history and even today the amount of humans or human population has been limited by our ability to get calories or get human consumable food from the land, so what I want to do in this video is give us a little bit of a framework for thinking about how humans have been gathering calories from the land and how that's placed an upper limit on the number of humans that can live in any given area, or the population density of humans. So right over here you have some gentlemen looking for food, they are hunter-gatherers. I'll say HG for short, and the H part, the hunter part that they might actually find some animals. I think these guys are trying right over here are trying to trap some rabbits and the gathering part, they're just literally looking for food maybe they find fruit of some sort, or some nuts or maybe some roots that are edible by humans so literally just walk around either try to kill things or find things they can consume. So I'll call this right over here stage one. So this is hunter-gatherers, this is what most humans have done through most of human history. And just to give us a little bit of a framework for how much they could get from the land, I looked in some of the best sense of studying HG populations in land like this maybe they can get about 200 calories. I'll make this a whole column, this whole column is the amount that they can get in terms of calories per square kilometre per day. Now it's obviously going to be hugely dependent on the number of animals that live there, the type of land that's there, if they're next to a stream where maybe fish are just jumping out of the stream this number would be much higher, if they were in some type of desert this number would be much lower. But this is actually fairly in line with some of the studies of HG cultures. Now if this the number of calories that they can get from each square kilometre per day, how many humans can live in a square kilometre per day? What is the density of humans? Well, to figure that out we have know on average how many calories does a human need to survive, and for the sake of this video I'm going to make the assumption that a human being needs 2,000 calories per day to survive in a non-malnourished state. And obviously it's hugely dependent on how activ this person is or how large they are. And one other note: this whole I will be using Calories with the capital C. The Calories with the capital C are the calories that people are used to refering to when you go to the gym and you run on the treadmill and it says how many calories you've burnt or you look at the back of your candy bar and it says 200 calories. These are tha calories I'm talking about. They're slightly different notion than the calories that you encounter in your chemistry class. Those calories are calories with a lower case c. And just so that you can be optimally confused it turns out that 1 Calory with an upper case C is equal to 1,000 calories with a lower case c. And the lower case c calories are the amount of energy needed to heat 1 gramme of water 1°C. So this is what you see in your chemistry class but this is not what we are going to be talking about in this video. We're talking about the capital C Calories that dietitians are always talking about. So with this assumption that the average human eats 2000 Calories a day to not get malnourished, and obviously man would eat more, women would eat less, children would eat even less, but with this assumption, what is the density of humans that could be supported by this culture right over here? Well, 200 Calories is 1 tenth of the average daily human requirement if you believe this assumption. The the population density, humans per square kilometre you can always support 1 tenth of a human with this Calory output! So you can only support 0.1 of a human per a square kilometre. So 1 human would actually need 10 square kilometres to hunt from and gather from in order to support just themselves! They would need maybe 30 or 40 square kilometres to support an entire family, so they could wander around and kill the animals and find whatever they need to find on that land. Now let's go to kind of you can view as maybe the next stage although it's now always the case that herding is going to be more productive than HG, especially with that case with the fish jumping out of the water, but let's go to the scenario right over here. So this is, we can call this a pastoral life-style. So this is 2, I'll call it pastoral. And over here is the realisation that, look, you have all of this vegetation that maybe humans can't consume but there are other animals that can consume this vegetation and they can turn those calories into calories that can be consumed by humans and, namely, the calories are themselves! So this gentleman right over here after he gets these sheep to be nice and fat, he can either eat the sheep or he can drink their milk, so one way to think about this cattle or these sheep right over here by herding them and letting them eat this grass he is turning non-human-consumable calories into human-consumable calories. And for the sake of our thought experiment let's tell we got 10 time increase in the human-consumable calories per square kilometre. So now instead of 200 we're up to 2,000. And so instead of one human per square kilometre per day to support one human ... oh sorry, instead of 0.1 we can now support 1 human. So in that 10 square kilometres we can now support 10 people, in 100 square kilometres we can now support 100 people. Now the next stage - and I'm skipping a bunch of stages because we have things like subsistence agriculture and various forms that are not going to be equally productive, it depends what the land is like, it depends what tools at disposal, but the next stage that I'll just kind of jump to we can call traditional agriculture. So this right over here, let's call that traditional agriculture. And that's this one over here as well, so both of these I'm going to call traditional agriculture. For the purposes of this video the difference between traditional agriculture and modern agriculture - in traditional agriculture you didn't have mechanisation, so you had very primitive mechanisation, you definitely didn't have fossil fuel based engines, you didn't have modern pesticides, you didn't have modern genetically engineered crops, but you have some of the basic science of breeding crop and irrigating and using animals as tools. So in this stage right over here, and once again, it completely depends on where you are on the planet, how fertile the land is, how good your tools are, what crops you are actually producing. Let's assume that we've got a hundredfold increasse in the productivity. And looking in some of the historical records it looks like, it's depending on once again where you are, that's not out of the realm of possibility. So you have a hundredfold increase, so insdead of 2,000 calories per square kilometre per day you can get 200,000 calories per square kilometre per day, and now you can support 100 humans per square kilometre - if you wanna to! So you might not have 100 humans, one on all of the land, you might not be able to farm from, or there are other limits on the population for whatever they might be, but the important thing is to think about this upper bound. In this traditional you are able to get type of productivity from your land and you are able to in theory support 100 people per 1 square kilometre, that means if all of a sudden you have 200 people living there, they maybe every once migrate to this land because it seems as specially fertile or there are really small farmers living there, then all of a sudden not everyone is going to get 2,000 calories a day, some people might get malnourished, other people might actually starve. There is this upper bound on the actual number of people that can be there based on how productive the land actually is. Now let's move over to modern agriculture and we want to talk a little bit about what exactly is modern agriculture. You have machines like this combine over here that does a lot of the human labour. One human can... I'll talk about the different dimensions because there are actually two dimensions here: how much calories can you get from the land, and how much energy and labour can one human input into the land using tools at their disposal. So in this case cattle, these oxen pulling this plough, or in this case this combine that's fueled by fossil fuels. But in modern agriculture, because all of the things, you have these amazing tools, you have genetically engineered crops, you have modern pesticides and ... not everyone is a fan of all of these things, but they have hugely increased our productivity. So you have modern agriculture. Let's say that you have another factor of 10 from traditional agriculture. so now you can get 2,000,000 calories per square kilometre per day, or you can support 1,000 humans per square kilometre. So once again this right over here is an upper bound. And just to give a sense, I picked these numbers just so that nubmers would be clear I looked in some historical records, these are completely out of line with what it looks like human have been able to do in the past, but to give you a sense of what human populatin densities look like right now and why this upper bound seems to be right about correct, in a place like the U.S. the population density is 30 people per square kilometre, 1in a more dense country or a significantly more dense country like India 1the population density is 300 humans per square kilometre. 1And in the most population dense country in the world, 1which is where I come from, or actually I was born in New Orleans, 1but where some of my ancestors came from, 1which is Bangladesh, so there's a lot of people like me, I guess, 1Bangladesh has population density of 900 humans per square kilometre! 1To some degree this is a testament to the fertility of the land and whatever else, 1but this is pretty near the limits depending on 1agricultural productivity in what now on the land 1of modern technology, so it really makes you think 1if you don't get population under control, 1you might end up with some of these kind of hitting the wall type of scenarios. 1And so the last thing I want you to think about 1and this is why I reffered to a little bit more, 1is just think about those two dimensions 1because sometimes it get a little bit muddled. 1One is the kind of the productivity of land 1and at the other there is productivity of labour. 1So right over here in HG, they're not getting many calories from their land 1so they're right over there, and the humans have to do all the labour, 1they don't have animals helping them in any way, 1they definitely don't have robots or any types of engines helping them in any way, 1and so there have to spend a lot of human time and a lot of human labour 1doing the work, getting that productivity from the land. 1But as progress with things that aid humans, 1so for example if you all of a sudden have cattle helping you 1or you have other tools that help you, 1you get more human productivity, so less and less of human labour 1has to be used to get that productivity from the land 1so maybe other humans can do other things 1like paint pictures or become blacksmiths or whatever, 1and in this direction you get higher productivity per unit of land 1and so that comes from moving from HG to a pastoral life-style 1to traditional farming with irrigation, to modern farming. 1And so in this graph kind of tools for the individuals move us up, 1getting productivity from the land moves us right, 1modern argriculture gets us right over here. 1So we're getting mach more calories per unit land 1and we're getting much more calories per unit labour. 1So you need much smaller percentage of the human population 1actually involved in the farming. 1Anyway, I let you go there, hopefuly that gives you at least an undesrtanding 1of that food doesn't just come from nowhere, 1it really is a rate-limiting factor on humanity's population.",science_cosmology-and-astronomy_life-earth-universe
" -  We're told Divya is seated on a Ferris Wheel at time t equals zero. The graph below shows her height h in meters, t seconds after the ride starts. So at time equals zero, she is, looks like about two, what is this, this would be one and a half, so it looks like she's about two meters off the ground and then as time increases, she gets as high as, it looks like this is close to 30, maybe 34 meters and then she comes back down, looks like two meters and up to 34 meters again, so let's read the question. So the question asks us, approximately how long does it take Divya to complete one revolution on the Ferris Wheel? All right, so this is interesting, so this is when she's at the bottom of the Ferris Wheel, so then she gets to the top of the Ferris Wheel, and then she keeps rotating until she gets back to the bottom of the Ferris Wheel again. So it took her 60 and t is in terms of seconds. So it took her 60 seconds to go from the bottom to the bottom again, and in another 60 seconds, she would have completed another revolution. And so let me fill that in, it is going to take her 60 seconds, 60 seconds, and we of course can check our answer if we like. Let's do another one of these. So here we have, a doctor observes the electrical activity of Finn's heart over a period of time. The electrical activity of Finn's heart is cyclical, as we hope it would be, and peaks every 0.9 seconds. Which of the following graphs could model the situation if t stands for time in seconds, and e stands for the electrical activity of Finn's heart in volts? Over here it looks like we peaked at zero seconds, and then here we're peaking a little bit more than one, this looks maybe at 1.1, maybe at 2.2 and 3.3. This looks like it's peaking a little bit more than every one second, so like maybe every 1.1 seconds, not every 0.9 seconds, so I'd rule out A. This one is peaking, it looks like the interval between peaks is less than a second, but it looks like a good bit less than a second. It looks like maybe every three quarters of a second, or maybe every four-fifths of a second. Not quite nine-tenths, nine-tenths this first peak would be a little bit closer to one, but this one is close. Choice C is looking good. The first we're at zero, then the first peak, this looks pretty close to one but it's less than one. It looks like a tenth less than one, so I like choice C. Now choice D, it looks like we're peaking every half-second, so it's definitely not that. So this looks like a peak of every 0.9 seconds. This is the best representation that I... This is the best representation that I can think of. And you can actually verify that. If you have a peak every 0.9 seconds, you're going to have four peaks in 3.6 seconds. So one, two, three, four, this looks like it's at 3.6. Over here, you have one, two, three, four, you've had four peaks in less than three seconds. So this one definitely isn't 0.9. So instead of just even forcing yourself to eyeball just between this peak and that peak, you can say well, if we're every 0.9 seconds, how long would three peaks take or four peaks, and then you can actually get a little bit more precise as you try to eyeball it. So we can check our answer and verify that we got it right.",math_algebra2_modeling
" -  What I want to do in this video is get some practice writing series in sigma notation and I have a series in front of us right over here. We have seven plus nine plus 11 and we keep on adding all the way up to 405. So first, let's just think about what's going on here. How can we think about what happens at each successive term? So we're at seven and then we're going to nine and then we're going to 11. It looks like we're adding two every time so it looks like this is an arithmetic series. So we add two and then we add two again and we're going to keep adding two all the way until we get to 405. So let's think about how many times we are going to add two to get to 200, sorry, how many times we have to add two to get to 405. So 405 is seven plus two times what? So let me write this down. So if we wanted 405 is equal to seven plus two times, I'll just write two times x. I'm just trying to figure out how many times do I have to add two to seven to get to 405? And so that is going to be equal to, let's see, so we subtract seven from both sides. We have 398 is equal to two x or let's see, divide both sides by two and we get this is going to be what? 199? 199 is equal to x. So we're essentially adding two 199 times. So this is the first time we're adding two. This is two times. We're adding two times one, adding two times two and here, we're adding two times 199 to our original seven. So let's think about this a little bit. So this is going be a sum, a sum from, so there's a couple of ways we could think about it. We could think about how many times we've added two so we could start with us adding two zero times, the number seven is when we haven't added two at all, all the way to when we add two 199 times. And let's think about this a little bit. This is going to be, we could write it as seven plus two times k. Seven times two, seven plus two times k. When k equals zero, this is just going to be seven. When k equals one, it's seven times two plus one. Well, it's going to be nine. When k is equal to two, it's going to be seven plus two times two which is 11. And all the way when k is equal to 199, it's going to be seven plus two times 199 which is 398 which would be 405. So that's one way that we could write it. Another way, we could also write it as, let me do this in a different color, we could, if we want to start our index at k is equal to one then let's see, it's going to be the first term is going to be seven plus two times k minus one, times k minus one. Notice, the first term works out because we're not adding two at all so one minus one is equal to zero so you're just going to get seven. Then when k is equal to two, the second term, we're going to add two one time because two minus one is two so that gives us that one. And so how many total terms are we going to have here? Well, one way to think about is I just shifted the indices up by one so we're going to go from k equals one to 200. And you can verify this. When k is equal to 200, this is going to be 200 minus one which is 199. Two times 199 is 398 plus seven is indeed 405. So when k equals 200, that is our last term here. So either way, these are legitimate ways of expressing this arithmetic series in using sigma notation.",math_algebra-home_alg-series-and-induction
" Let's once again see if we can order now a different set of decimals from least to greatest, and once again I encourage you to pause this video and try to do this on your own. So let's go to the most significant place, the ones place here. None of these have any ones. So then we can go to the next most significant place, which is the tenths place. This has five tenths. This has six tenths. This has one tenth. This has five tenths. This has one tenth. So if we just look at the tenths place, the ones that have the fewest tenths-- this has only one tenth, this one only has one tenth, this one has five tenths, this one has five tenths, and then this one has six tenths. So I've ordered it by what's going on in the tenths place. Now, both of these have the same number of tenths. Let's move to the hundredths place to figure out which of these is larger. This one has six hundredths. This has five hundredths, so this one is larger. It has more hundredths. Same number of tenths, more hundredths. And hundredths are obviously more significant than thousandths, so it doesn't matter which one has the more thousandths. It matters that this one has more tenths, and actually this one has more thousandths as well. But now let's go look at these two. These have the same number of tenths. They both have five tenths. But this one has six hundredths, while this one only has two hundredths, so this one is larger. And then finally, this one of course, had six tenths, so this one had the most tenths. So we don't even have to look at the other places here. And we're done.",math_in-in-class-6-math-india-icse_in-in-6-decimals-icse
" -  So i have a box and whiskers plot showing us the ages of students at a party. And what I'm hoping to do in this video is get a little bit of practice interpreting this. And what I have here are five different statements and I want you to look at these statements. Pause the video, look at these statements, and think about which of these, based on the information in the box and whiskers plot, which of these are for sure true, which of these are for sure false, and which of these we don't have enough information, it could go either way. Alright, so let's work through these. So the first statement is that all of the students are less than 17 years old. Well we see, right over here, that the maximum age, that's the right end of this right whisker is 16. So it is the case that all of the students are less than 17 years old. So this is definitely going to be true. The next statement. At least 75% of the students are 10 years old or older. So, when you look at this, this feels right, because 10 is, 10 is the value that is at the beginning of the second quartile. This is the second quartile right over there. And actually, let me do this, let me do this in a different color. So, this is the second quartile. So 25% of the value of the numbers are in the second, or roughly, sometimes it's not exactly, so approximately, I'll say roughly 25% are going to be in this second quartile, approximately 25% are going to be in the third quartile, and approximately 25% are going to be in the fourth quartile. So it seems reasonable for saying 10 years old or older that this is going to be, this is going to be true. In fact, you could even have a couple of values in the first quartile that are 10. But to make that a little more tangible, let's look at some, so I'm feeling, I'm feeling good that this is true, but let's look a few more examples to make this a little more concrete. So they don't know, we don't know, based on the information here exactly how many students are at the party. We'll have to construct some scenarios. So we could do a scenario, let's see if we can do... We could do a scenario where well let's see, let's see if I can, I can construct something where, let's see, the median is 13. We know that for sure. The median is 13, so if I have an odd number, I would have 13 in the middle, just like that, and maybe I have three on either side. And I'm just making that number up. I'm just trying to see what I can learn about different types of data sets that could be described by this box and whiskers plot. So 10 is going to be the middle of the bottom half. So that's 10 right over there. And 15 is going to be the middle of the top half. That's what this box and whiskers plot is telling us. And they of course tell us what the minimum, the minimum is seven. And they tell us that the maximum is 16. So we know that's seven and then that is 16. And then this, right over here, could be anything. It could be 10, it could be 11, it could be 12, it could be 13. It wouldn't change what these medians are. It wouldn't change this box and whiskers plot. Similarly, this could be 13, it could be 14, it could be 15, and so any of those values wouldn't change it. And so 75% are 10 or older, well, this value, in this case, six out of seven are 10 years old or older. And we could try it out with other, other scenarios where... let's try to minimize the number of 10s given this data set. Well we could do something like, let's say that we have eight. So let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And so here we know that the minimum, we know that the minimum is seven, we know that the maximum is 16. We know, we know that the, we know that the mean of these middle two values, we have an even number now so, the median is going to be the mean of these two values. So, it's going to be the mean of this and this, is going to be 13. And we know that the mean of, we know that the mean of this and this is going to be 10 and that the mean of this and this is going to be, is going to be 15. So what could we construct? Well actually, we don't even have to construct to answer this question. We know that, we know that this is going, this is going to have to be 10 or larger. And then all of these other things are going to be 10 or larger, so this is exactly 75%. Exactly 75% if we assume that this is less than 10, are going to be 10 years old or older. So feeling very good, very good, about this one right over here. And actually, just to make this concrete, I'll put in some values here. You know this could be, this could be a nine and an 11. This could be a 12 and a 14. This could be a 14 and a 16. Or, it could be, it could be a 15 and a 15. You could think about it and in any of those, in any of those ways. But feeling very good that this is definitely going to be true based on the information given in this plot. Now they say there's only one seven-year-old at the party. One seven-year-old at the party. Well this first, this first possibility that we looked at, that was the case. There was only one seven-year-old at the party and there was one 16-year-old at the party. And actually, that was the next statement, there's only one 16-year-old at the party. So both of these seem like we can definitely construct data that's consistent with this box plot, box and whiskers plot, where this is true. But could we construct one where it's not true? Well sure. Let's imagine, let's see, we have our median at 13. Median at 13. And then we have, let's see, one, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. This is gonna be, this is gonna be the 10, the median of this bottom half. This is going to be 15. This is going to be seven. This is going to be 16. Well this could also be seven. It doesn't have to be. It could be seven, eight, nine, or ten. This could also be 16. Doesn't have to be. It could be 15 as well. But just like that, I've constructed a data set, and these could be, you know this could be 10, 11, 12, 13. This could be 10, 11, 12, 13. This could be 13, 14, 15. This one also could be 13, 14, 15. But the simple thing is, or the basic idea here, I can have a data set where I have multiple sevens and multiple 16s, or I could have a data set where I only have one seven or only one 16. So both of these statements, we just plain don't know. We just don't, we just don't know. Now the next statement, exactly half the students are older than 13. Well if you look at this possibility up here, we saw that three out of the seven are older than 13. So that's not exactly half. 3/7 is not 1/2. But in this one over here, we did see that exactly half are over, are older than 13. In fact, if you're saying exactly half... Well, in this one we're saying that exactly half are older than 13. We have an even number right over here. And so it is exactly half. So it's possible that it's true, it's possible that it's not true based on the information given. We once again, we once again don't, we once again do not know. Anyway, hopefully you found this interesting. This is, the whole point of me doing this is when you look at statistics, sometimes it's easy to kind of say, okay I think it roughly means that, and that's sometimes okay. But it's very important to think about what types of actual statements you can make and what you can't make and it's very important when you're looking at statistics to say, well you know what, I just don't know. That the data actually is not telling me that thing for sure.",math_statistics-probability_summarizing-quantitative-data
" -  Most solids offer some amount of resistance to the flow of current through them. This allows us to define things like the resistivity, or the conductivity, but the same is true for liquids. Consider this container full of a liquid. We can measure its resistivity. Now, if I took a battery, and I put one lead here, and one lead here, if there is a voltage and this liquid is able to conduct electricity, then this current should be able to flow through the intervening liquid over to the other side and then back up. Sometimes, this is done with AC current, otherwise, you might get electrolysis and then you get bubbles in here and that changes the liquid in some way. We want to measure the resistance and the resistivity of the liquid, not of some altered liquid. So, sometimes you use AC, but this is the general principal. Send in a voltage, a certain amount of current will flow. How can we use that, to determine the resistivity? Well, we know resistivity is equal to the resistance that we measure times the area divided by the length, and now you see there's kinda of a problem length. I can imagine getting that. This length in here would just be this distance. There's my length, because my ""resistor,"" is this liquid in here. But, what's my area? So, this would be a bad experiment to do. If we want to measure the resistivity, what we really want, is something where we have a well defined area. Let me get rid of this. Imagine you had two plates. Take these two plates. You put them in the solution you want to measure the resistivity of, so, we put them in here. Stick them into there. They have a well defined area. We've got those. We can measure those if we want. We set them apart some known distance between them, L, and you hook them up to battery. So, take this one, hook it up to a known voltage, hook the other side up to the other plate, and if this solution, if this electrolytic solution in here can conduct electricity, current will flow from this side to the other side, and you can measure these quantities. You measure the length, that's easy. You measure the area. You got that. How do we measure the resistance? Well, we know the voltage. We can have a known voltage of the battery up here, and you can stick ammeter in here to measure the current. If I stick an ammeter, ammeters measure the current. Now, I can just use Ohm's law, and I know that the resistance is just going to be the voltage divided by the current, and if plug all these values into here, I can get an experimental value for the resistivity of this liquid, sometimes it's called the electrolytic resistivity. Or, one over the electrolytic resistivity would be the electrolytic conductivity. So, this would be the electrolytic conductivity. So, this is an experimental way to do it. Honestly, you don't even have to go through all that much trouble. You can just take a solution. First, put a solution in here that has a known resistivity. That way, you can just do this: R equals Rho L over A. If you know the resistivity, and you can easily measure the resistance, then you can just figure out what this constant is, and this will stay the same. You just leave those same plates in there with the same length and the same area. Put a new solution in there, and that gives you this number, and this number staying the same. So, technically speaking, you don't have to go in there, measure the area each time, and the length between these each time, if you have some calibrated electrolytic solution where it has a known resistivity. Or, you could use it the other way. If you had a solution with a known resistivity, but there may be impurities in there, or there may be dissolved salts, or something, and you want to know what the concentration is. Well, that is going to directly affect how much current will flow, and it will directly affect the measured electrolytic conductivity. So, if you measure this, and it comes out different from what you would expect from a baseline solution. You can figure out what the concentration is of the conductive impurities within this solution.",science_physics_circuits-topic
" - So I have drawn four different triglyceride molecules over here. And some of you might be saying, ""wait I thought triglycerides they involve ""all of these carbons and hydrogens and oxygens"". Well I see the oxygens over here but where's all of the carbons and hydrogens? And my answer to you is that they will be implicit. This is a short-hand way of diagramming out these large molecules. And you'll see this many times when you take chemistry, biology, organic chemistry. And what's happening here is that each of these pointy parts of this chain, each of these vertices there's implicitly a carbon. There's a carbon there, there's a carbon there. There's a carbon there. And there's also, if we don't put a letter at the end of the chain, there's also a carbon right over there. So implicitly there's a carbon there, there's a carbon there, there's a carbon there. Now you might also be wondering what about the hydrogens? Well we assume that every carbon has four covalent bonds. And so if there's extra covalent bonds for each of these carbons, we assume that those covalent bonds are with hydrogen. So for example, this carbon right over here, it has two covalent bonds. So the other two covalent bonds must be must be with hydrogens. Same thing for this carbon right over there. It must be bonded to two hydrogens. This carbon, the way its drawn, we only explicitly see one covalent bond. So there must be three covalent bonds. There must be three covalent bonds to hydrogens. So the carbons and hydrogens are all there. They're just implicitly there. Now you might notice, and actually, if you don't notice, I encourage you to pause and think about what the difference is between this triglyceride, this triglyceride this triglyceride and that triglyceride. And it might jump at you pretty quickly. What jumps at you is this triglyceride has no double bonds. This one has one double bond. This one has several double bonds. And this one also has several double bonds. But these two are also different and we're gonna think about the way that they're different. You might immediately see that this one kinda kinds and curves while this one is able to stay relatively straight. And actually that is the main difference. And we're gonna talk about it in a second why that is. But first lets talk about this one. When you have all single bonds one way to think about it is that you have put as many hydrogens onto these carbon chains as you can. Or another way of thinking about it is we have saturated this fat with hydrogens. And that's why this is called a saturated fat. A saturated, this is a saturated fat. This is something that you might have heard of. This is referring to things like butter. They've a lot of different fats that we tend to associate with being solid at room temperature. And the reason why they're solid at room temperature is because this are all bonded to these hydrogens. There's no kinks for them to do to the double bonds. These are able to be relatively dense. Which allows it to be solid or typically solid at room temperature. And these are sometimes associated with, I don't want to get into the whole nutritional battles about saturated fat and fat's good or bad. But these are sometimes associated these are sometimes called your bad fats. But as we'll see they aren't the worse fats. The worse fats are actually this one right over here. But we'll talk about that in a second. So this is saturated fat because a way to think about it is it's saturated with as many hydrogens as possible. Now this one of the right, and I don't know anything about it it has all single bonds. Now over here, or all single bonds between the carbons. Over here we see a double bond. We see a double bond between that carbon and that carbon. And because of that, this carbon already has three covalent bonds so it's only gonna be bonded with one hydrogen. This one already has three covalent bonds so it's only gonna be bonded with one hydrogen as opposed to two like these characters over here. And because of that we don't have as many hydrogens on the chain as possible. So we consider this to be an unsaturated fat. Unsaturated fat. We don't have as many hydrogens as possible. And because of that unsaturated fat, and specially polyunsaturated fats, these double bonds they tend to form these kinks in the structure which keep the molecules from getting really, really dense which tends to make them liquid or more likely to be liquid at room temperature. So this is an unsaturated fat. This right over here, we have multiple, we have multiple double bonds in play. This is called a polyunsaturated fat. Polyunsaturated fat. And since this actually only has, they're both unsaturated fats. This is a polyunsaturated fat. And since this only has one double bond we can call this a monounsaturated fat. So these are both unsaturated fat. This is many times happening so poly. This is happening once, so we call it monounsaturated fat. Now one question you might have is why are the kinks forming for this molecule and this molecule. And why are they not forming with this molecule even though this one has double bonds as well. And this goes to our good friends cis and trans. And so you might remember, if you have a double bond between carbons. And lets say that you have, lets say that you have one configuration. Let me just do it this way. Lets say you've one configuration where this is attached to some type of a carbon chain, and lets say that this is a hydrogen. Then on the other side the rest of the carbon chain it could be in one of two configurations. The rest of the carbon the rest of the carbon chain could be on the same side as the carbon chain on the left. So I'll put R' there. And, let me do that in the same color. So you have your hydrogen. So this is one configuration. Now another configuration would be carbon double bonded to carbon. You have your hydrogen but now the hydrogens are on opposite sides. And your chains, the rest of the carbon chains are on opposite sides. And as we talked about before, this is because double bonds are rigid. You can't rotate around it. So it matters, these are actually different, these are actually different isomers right over here. Depending on whether this chain is on the same side as this chain. Or whether is on the same side. When it's on the same side we call this a cis configuration and this is a trans, trans configuration. And it turns out that most naturally produced unsaturated fats are in the cis configuration. And because they're on the cis configuration whenever you have these double bonds, it forms, it makes the chain actually bend. And if you have many of these double bonds it makes it bend a lot. And so polyunsaturated fats are even more likely to be liquid because it's very hard to pack them. So what's going on over here? Well these are actually the configuration where the, I guess you could say, the rest of the carbon chains are on opposite sides of the double bond. Notice this carbon chain it might be a little bit hard to see is above the double bond. We formed a covalent bond going upward there. While this carbon chain, right over here, is below the double bond. And because of that it doesn't form a kink and these are in the trans configuration. And so this right over here, this is called a trans fat. This is called a trans fat. And they aren't typically found, they aren't typically found in nature. Now it's interesting about trans fats is a lot of folks say ""hey you know, okay, ""maybe saturated fat is bad for us. ""Maybe we shouldn't eat as much butter and all of that"". And some of that's even up for debate these days. And they say, ""what if we started with unsaturated fats?"". Which are typically viewed as more healthy, our polyunsaturated fat. And were just throw a bunch of hydrogens on them, may be not to fully saturate it, but enough hydrogen so that some of these double bonds disappear. And so it's more solid at room temperature which might make it a good replacement for butter in cooking. And a lot of the shortening that you might have seen even 10, 15 years ago, or even today in a lot of places, they're essentially trans fat. And so what happened is is that, yes, you can replace a lot of these, you can start to saturate it more with hydrogens. But that process also turned some of the cis double bonds into trans double bonds. And at first people said, ""oh that's harmless, ""this is probably good for you, it's still unsaturated"". But it has some of the properties of a saturated fat. It's nice and solid and buttery and all of that. And maybe is even cheaper to produce. You can take it from other oils. But it turns out that this is very unhealthy. There's a lot of debates in nutrition, but this is unequivocally unhealthy. This does not exist in nature and it has all sorts of bad impacts. And that's why a lot of states, and even countries have now banned trans fats. They actually, I've even heard people go so far and say ""this is actually poisonous ""to your body"" in certain ways. And it really affects you in extremely negative ways. That might be extra strong language but I'm, I guess I'm trying to scare you a little bit. Don't eat trans fats. Anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that.",science_biology_macromolecules
" We've done several videos already where we're approximating the area under a curve by breaking up that area into rectangles and then finding the sum of the areas of those rectangles as an approximation. And this was actually the first example that we looked at where each of the rectangles had an equal width. So we equally partitioned the interval between our two boundaries between a and b. And the height of the rectangle was the function evaluated at the left endpoint of each rectangle. And we wanted to generalize it and write it in sigma notation. It looked something like this. And this was one case. Later on, we looked at a situation where you define the height by the function value at the right endpoint or at the midpoint. And then we even constructed trapezoids. And these are all particular instances of Riemann sums. So this right over here is a Riemann sum. And when people talk about Riemann sums, they're talking about the more general notion. You don't have to just do it this way. You could use trapezoids. You don't even have to have equally-spaced partitions. I used equally-spaced partitions because it made things a little bit conceptually simpler. And this right here is a picture of the person that Riemann sums was named after. This is Bernhard Riemann. And he made many contributions to mathematics. But what he is most known for, at least if you're taking a first-year calculus course, is the Riemann sum. And how this is used to define the Riemann integral. Both Newton and Leibniz had come up with the idea of the integral when they had formulated calculus, but the Riemann integral is kind of the most mainstream formal, or I would say rigorous, definition of what an integral is. So as you could imagine, this is one instance of a Riemann sum. We have n right over here. The larger n is, the better an approximation it's going to be. So his definition of an integral, which is the actual area under the curve, or his definition of a definite integral, which is the actual area under a curve between a and b is to take this Riemann sum, it doesn't have to be this one, take any Riemann sum, and take the limit as n approaches infinity. So just to be clear, what's happening when n approaches infinity? Let me draw another diagram here. So let's say that's my y-axis. This is my x-axis. This is my function. As n approaches infinity-- so this is a, this is b-- you're just going to have a ton of rectangles. You're just going to get a ton of rectangles over there. And there are going to become better and better approximations for the actual area. And the actual area under the curve is denoted by the integral from a to b of f of x times dx. And you see where this is coming from or how these notations are close. Or at least in my brain, how they're connected. Delta x was the width for each of these sections. This right here is delta x. So that is a delta x. This is another delta x. This is another delta x. A reasonable way to conceptualize what dx is, or what a differential is, is what delta x approaches, if it becomes infinitely small. So you can conceptualize this, and it's not a very rigorous way of thinking about it, is an infinitely small-- but not 0-- infinitely small delta x, is one way that you can conceptualize this. So once again, as you have your function times a little small change in delta x. And you are summing, although you're summing an infinite number of these things, from a to b. So I'm going to leave you there just so that you see the connection. You know the name for these things. And once again, this one over here, this isn't the only Riemann sum. In fact, this is often called the left Riemann sum if you're using it with rectangles. You can do a right Riemann sum. You could use the midpoint. You could use a trapezoid. But if you take the limit of any of those Riemann sums, as n approaches infinity, then that you get as a Riemann definition of the integral. Now so far, we haven't talked about how to actually evaluate this thing. This is just a definition right now. And for that we will do in future videos.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-accumulation-riemann-sums
" Lisa owns a ""Random Candy"" vending machine, which is a machine that picks a candy out of an assortment in a random fashion. Lisa controls the probability in which each candy is picked. She is running out of ""Honey Bunny,"" so she wants to program its probability so that the probability of getting a different candy twice in a row is greater than 2 and 1/4 times the probability of getting ""Honey Bunny"" in one try. So let me read that again. She wants to program its probability so that the probability of getting a different candy twice in a row, or really any other candy twice in a row, is greater than 2 and 1/4 times the probability of getting ""Honey Bunny"" in one try. Write an inequality that models the situation. Use p to represent the probability of getting ""Honey Bunny"" in one try. Solve the inequality, and complete the sentence. Remember that the probability must be a number between 0 and 1. So we want to write the inequality that models the problem here. And then we want to complete the sentence, the probability of getting ""Honey Bunny"" in one try must be-- so they give us a bunch of options. Greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or equal to, and then we have to put some number here. So to work through this, I've copy and pasted this problem onto my little scratch pad right over here. And so let's just think about it a little bit. So they tell us, use p to represent the probability of getting ""Honey Bunny"" in one try. And they also say she wants to program its probability so that the probability of getting a different candy twice in a row is greater than 2 and 1/4 the probability of getting ""Honey Bunny"" in one try. So if p is the probability of getting ""Honey Bunny,"" what's the probability of getting any other candy at once? Well, that's going to be 1 minus p. If you have a probability of p of getting ""Honey Bunny, well, then it's 1 minus p of anything but ""Honey Bunny."" Now, what's the probability of getting this twice in a row, of getting anything else twice in a row? Well, you're just going to multiply this probability times itself. It's going to be 1 minus p times 1 minus p, or we could just write that as 1 minus p squared. So this right over here is the probability of getting a different candy, any other candy, twice in a row. So prob of any other non-""Honey Bunny"" candy, any other candy, twice in a row. Now, they tell us that this probability needs to be greater than 2 and 1/4 times the probability of getting ""Honey Bunny"" in one try. So is greater than 2 and 1/4 times the probability of getting ""Honey Bunny"" in one try, well, that is p-- times p. So we have just set up the first part. We have written an inequality that models the situation. Now let's actually solve this inequality. And so to do that, I will just expand 1 minus p squared out. 1 minus p squared is the same thing as-- well, I'll just multiply it out. So this is going to be 1 squared minus 2p plus p squared. And that's going to be greater than 2 and 1/4 p. Now let's see. If we subtract 2 and 1/4 p from both sides, we're going to be left with-- and I'm going to reorder this. We're going to get p squared. So you have minus 2p minus 2 and 1/4 p, so that's going to get us minus 4 and 1/4 p. Or let me just write that as 17/4 p plus 1 is greater than 0. And so let's think about solving this quadratic right over here. And under which circumstances is this greater than 0? To think about it, let's factor it. And actually, before we factor it, let's simplify it a little bit. I don't like having this 17/4 right over here, so let's multiply both sides times 4. And since 4 is a positive number, it's not going to change the sign, the direction of this inequality. So we could rewrite this as 4p squared minus 17p plus 4 is greater than 0. And let's see. What are the roots of this? And we could use the quadratic formula if we wanted to do it really quick. We could probably do it other ways. But negative b-- so it's going to be 17 plus or minus the square root of negative 17 squared-- b squared-- so that's 289 minus 4 times a times c. Well a times c is 16 times 4, so minus 64. All of that over 2 times a-- all of that over 8. So that's 17 plus or minus-- let's see, this is the square root of 225 over 8, which is equal to 17 plus or minus 15 over 8, which is equal to-- let's see, 17 minus 15 over 8 is 2/8-- which is equal to 2/8 or 1/4. So that's one of them. That's when we take the minus. And if we add 17 plus 15, that gets us to 32 divided by 8 is 4. So there's two situations right over here. Let's factor this out. We could write this as p minus 1/4 times p minus 4 is greater than 0. So under what circumstances is this going to be true? What constraints are this going to be true? Well if you're taking the product of two terms and they are going to be greater than 0, that means that these two things have to be the same sign. Or actually, in particular, they both have to be positive, or they both have to be negative. So let's look at those two situations. And I'll switch colors here just for fun-- so both positive or both negative. So if they are both positive-- let me do it here. That means that p minus 1/4 has to be greater than 0, and p minus 4 is greater than 0. Add 1/4 on both sides right over here. You get p is greater than 1/4, and p is greater than 4. So that's the situation where they are both positive. Now, what about if they are both negative? Well then you have p minus 1/4 is less than 0, and p minus 4 is less than 0. Add 1/4 here. So p needs to be less than 1/4, and p needs to be less than 4. Now, what does this constraint simplify to? p has to be greater than 1/4, and p has to be greater than 4. Well, if p is greater than 4, it's definitely going to be greater than 1/4. So all of this collapses into p needs to be greater than 4. That's the situation where both are positive. p must be greater than 4. Now what about here? Well if p is less than 1/4, it's definitely going to be less than four. And this is an and right over here, so this collapses to p is a less than 1/4. So which one do we go with-- p needs to be greater than 4, or p needs to be less than 1/4? Well, we need to remind ourselves that we're talking about a probability. To go back to the original problem, we're talking about a probability of someone getting ""Honey Bunny"" in one try. A probability must be between 0 and 1, so the probability having to be greater than 4, well that just doesn't make any sense. That doesn't make any sense in the context of this question. So we have to go with the probability of getting ""Honey Bunny"" needs to be less than 1/4, or less than 0.25, which makes complete sense. So let's fill in this information. This was the inequality that modeled the problem. And we got p has to be less than 1/4. So let's go back to the original problem. The inequality was 1 minus p squared needs to be greater than 2 and 1/4. So we could write that multiple times. I could write that as 2.25 times p. And then the probability of getting ""Honey Bunny"" in one try must be less than 0.25. And we're done.",math_algebra-home_alg-modeling
" I don't think it's any secret that if one were to do any kind of science, they're going to be dealing with a lot of numbers. It doesn't matter whether you do biology, or chemistry, or physics, numbers are involved. And in many cases, the numbers are very large. They are very, very large numbers. Very large numbers. Or, they're very, small, very small numbers. Very small numbers. You could imagine some very large numbers. If I were to ask you, how many atoms are there in the human body? Or how cells are in the human body? Or the mass of the Earth, in kilograms, those are very large numbers. If I were to ask you the mass of an electron, that would be a very, very small number. So any kind of science, you're going to be dealing with these. And just as an example, let me show you one of the most common numbers you're going to see, in especially chemistry. It's called Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number. And if I were write it in just the standard way of writing a number, it would literally be written as-- do it in a new color. It would be 6022-- and then another 20 zeroes. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. And even I were to throw some commas in here, it's not going to really help the situation to make it more readable. Let me throw some commas in here. This is still a huge number. If I have to write this on a piece of paper or if I were to publish some paper on using Avogadro's number, it would take me forever to write this. And even more, it's hard to tell if I forgot to write a zero or if I maybe wrote too many zeroes. So there's a problem here. Is there a better way to write this? So is there a better way to write this than to write it all out like this? To write literally the 6 followed by the 23 digits, or the 6022 followed by the 20 zeroes there? And to answer that question-- and in case you're curious, Avogadro's number, if you had 12 grams of carbon, especially 12 grams of carbon-12, this is how many atoms you would have in that. And just so you know, 12 grams is like a 50th of a pound. So that just gives you an idea of how many atoms are laying around at any point in time. This is a huge number. The point of here isn't to teach you some chemistry. The point of here is to talk about an easier way to write this. And the easier way to write this we call scientific notation. Scientific notation. And take my word for it, although it might be a little unnatural for you at this video. It really is an easier way to write things like things like that. Before I show you how to do it, let me show you the underlying theory behind scientific notation. If I were to tell you, what is 10 to the 0 power? We know that's equal to 1. What is 10 to the 1 power? That's equal to 10. What's 10 squared? That's 10 times 10. That's 100. What is 10 to the third? 10 to the third is 10 times 10 times 10, which is equal to 1,000. I think you see a general pattern here. 10 to the 0 has no 0's. No 0's in it. 10 to the 1 has one 0. 10 to the second power-- I was going to say the two-th power. 10 to the second power has two 0's. Finally, 10 to the third has three 0's. Don't want to beat a dead horse here, but I think you get the idea. Three 0's. If I were to do 10 to the 100th power, what would that look like? I don't feel like writing it all out here, but it would be 1 followed by-- you could guess it-- a hundred 0's. So it would just be a bunch of 0's. And if we were to count up all of those 0's, you would have one hundred 0's right there. And actually, this might be interesting, just as an aside. You may or may not know what this number is called. This is called a googol. A googol. In the early '90s if someone said, hey, that's a googol, you wouldn't have thought of a search engine. You would have thought of the number 10 to the 100th power, which is a huge number. It's more than the number of atoms, or the estimated number of atoms, in the known universe. In the known universe. It raises the question of what else is there out there. But I was reading up on this not too long ago. And if I remember correctly, the known universe has the order of 10 to the 79th to 10 to the 81 atoms. And this is, of course, rough. No one can really count this. People are just kind of estimating it. Or even better, guesstimating this. But this is a huge number. What may be even more interesting to you is this number was the motivation behind the naming a very popular search engine-- Google. Google is essentially just a misspelling of the word ""googol"" with the O-L. And I don't know why they called it Google. Maybe they got the domain name. Maybe they want to hold this much information. Maybe that many bytes of information. Or, it's just a cool word. Whatever it is-- maybe it was the founder's favorite number. But it's a cool thing to know. But anyway, I'm digressing. This is a googol. It's just 1 with a hundred 0's. But I could equivalently have just written that as 10 to 100, which is clearly an easier way. This is an easier way to write this. This is easier. In fact, this is so hard to write that I didn't even take the trouble to write it. It would have taken me forever. This was just twenty 0's right here. A hundred 0's I would have filled up this screen and you have found it boring. So I didn't even write it. So clearly, this is easier to write. This is just good for powers of 10. But how can we write something that isn't a direct power of 10? How can we use the power of this simplicity? How can we use the power of the simplicity somehow? And to do that, you just need to make the realization. This number, we can write it as-- so this has how many digits in it? It has 1, 2, 3, and then twenty 0's. So it has 23 digits after the 6. 23 digits after the 6. So what happens if I use this-- if I try to get close to it with a power of 10? So what if I were to say 10 to the 23? Do it in this magenta. 10 to the 23rd power. That's equal to what? That equals 1 with 23 0's. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. You get the idea, that's 10 to the 23rd. Now, can we somehow write this guy as some multiple of this guy? Well, we can. Because if we multiplied this guy by 6-- if we multiply 6 times 10 to the 23rd, what do we get? Well, we're just going to have a 6 with twenty three 0's. We're going to have a 6, and then you're going to have twenty three 0's. Let me write that. You're going to have twenty three 0's like that. Because all I did, if you take 6 times this. You know how to multiply. You'd have the 6 times this 1. You'd get a 6. And then all the 6 times the 0's will all be 0. So you'll have 6 followed by twenty three 0's. So that's pretty useful. But still, we're not getting quite to this number. I mean, this had some 2's in there. So how could we do it a little bit better? Well, what if we wrote it as a decimal? This number right here is identical to this number if these 2's were 0's. But if we want to put those 2's there, what can we do? We could put some decimals here. We could say that this is the same thing as 6.022 times 10 to the 23rd. And now, this number is identical to this number, but it's a much easier way to write it. And you could verify it, if you like. It will take you a long time. Maybe we should do it with a smaller number first. But if you multiply 6.022 times 10 to the 23rd, and you write it all out, you will get this number right there. You will get Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number. And although this is complicated or it looks a little bit unintuitive to you at first, this was just a number written out. This has a multiplication and then a 10 to a power. You might say, hey, that's not so simple. But it really is. Because you immediately know how many 0's there are. And it's obviously a much shorter way to write this number. Let's do a couple of more. I started with Avogadro's number because it really shows you the need for a scientific notation. So you don't have to write things like that over and over again. So let's do a couple of other numbers. And we'll just write them in scientific notation. So let's say I have the number 7,345. And I wanted to write it in scientific notation. So I guess the best way to think about it is, it's 7,345. So how can I represent a thousand? Well, I wrote it over here, 10 to the third is 1,000. So we know that 10 to the third is equal to 1,000. So that's essentially the largest power of 10 that I can fit into this. This is seven 1,000's. So if this is seven 1,000's, and then it's 0.3 1,00's, then it's 0.4 1,000's-- I don't know if that helps you, we can write this as 7.345 times 10 to the third because it's going to be seven 1,000's plus 0.3 1,000's. What's 0.3 times 1,000? 0.3 times 1,000 is 300. What's 0.04 times 1,000? That's 40. What's 0.05 times 1,000? That's a 5. So 7.345 times 1,000 is equal to 7,345. 1Let me multiply it out just to make it clear. 1So if I took 7.345 times 1,000. 1The way I do it is I ignore the 0's. 1I essentially multiply 1 times that guy up there. 1So I get 7, 3, 4, 5. 1Then I had three 0's here, so I put those on the end. 1And then I have three decimal places. 11, 2, 3. 1So 1, 2, 3. 1Put the decimal right there. 1And there you have it, 7.345 times 1,000 is indeed 7,345. 1Let's do a couple of them. 1Let's say we wanted to write the number 16 in scientific notation. 1Obviously, there's no need to write in scientific notation. 1But how would you do it? 1Well, what's the largest power of 10 that fits into 6? 1Well, the largest power of 10 that fits into 6 is just 1. 1So we could write it as something times 10 to the 0. 1This is just 1, right? 1That's just 1. 1So 6 is what times 1? 1Well, it's just 6. 1So 6 is equal to 6 times 10 to the 0. 1You wouldn't actually have to write it this way. 1This is much simpler, but it shows you 1that you really can express any number in scientific notation. 1Now, what if we wanted to represent something like this? 1I had started off the video saying in science 1you deal with very large and very small numbers. 1So let's say you had the number-- do it in this color. 1And you had 1, 2, 3, 4. 1And then, let's say five 0's. 1And then you have followed by a 7. 1Well, once again, this is not an easy number to deal with. 1But how can we deal with it as a power of 10? 1As a power of 10? 1So what's the largest power of 10 that fits into this number, 1that this number is divisible by? 1So let's think about it. 1All the powers of 10 we did before were going to positive 1or going to-- well, yeah, positive powers of 10. 1We could also do negative powers of 10. 1We know that 10 to the 0 is 1. 1Let's start there. 110 to the minus 1 is equal to 1/10, which is equal to 0.1. 1Let me switch colors. 1I'll do pink. 110 to the minus 2 is equal to 1 over 10 squared, which 1is equal to 1/100, which is equal to 0.01. 1And you I think you get the idea that the--, well, let 1me just do one more so that you can get the idea. 110 to the minus 3. 110 to the minus 3 is equal to 1 over 10 to the third, 1which is equal to 1/1,000, which is equal to the 0.001. 1So the general pattern here is 10 to the whatever 1negative power is however many places you're 1going to have behind the decimal point. 1So here, it's not the number of 0's. 1In here, 10 to the minus 3, you only 1have two 0's but you have three places 1behind the decimal point. 1So what is the largest power of 10 that goes into this? 1Well, how many places behind the decimal point do I have? 1I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1So 10 to the minus 6 is going to be equal to 0.-- 1and we're going to have six places 1behind the decimal point. 1And the last place is going to be a 1. 1So you're going to have Five 0's and a 1. 1That's 10 to the minus 6. 1Now, this number right here is 7 times this number. 1If we multiply this times 7, we get 7 times 1. 1And then we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 numbers 1behind the decimal point. 1So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 1So this number times 7 is clearly equal to the number 1that we started off with. 1So we can rewrite this number. 1Instead of writing this number every time, 1we can write it as being equal to this number. 1Or, we could write it as 7. 1This is equal to 7 times this number. 1But this number is no better than that number. 1But this number is the same thing as 10 to the minus 6. 17 times 10 to the minus 6. 1So now you can imagine numbers like-- imagine 1the number-- what if we had a 7-- let 1me think of it this way. 1Let's say we had a 7, 3 over there. 1So what would we do? 1Well, we'd want to go to the first digit 1right here because this is kind of the largest power of 10 1that could go into this thing right here. 1So if we wanted to represent that thing, 1let me do another decimal that's like that one. 1So let's say I did 0.0000516 and I wanted to represent this 1in scientific notation. 1I'd go to the first non-digit 0-- 1the first non-zero digit, not non-digit 0, which is there. 1And I'm like, OK, what's the largest power of 10 1that will fit into that? 1So I'll go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1So it's going to be equal to 5.16. 1So I take 5 there, then everything else 1is going to be behind the decimal point. 1Times 10. 1So this is going to be the largest power of 10 that 1fits into this first non-zero number. 1So it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1So 10 to the minus 5 power. 1Let me do another example. 1So the point I wanted to make is you just go to the first-- 1if you're starting at the left, the first non-zero number. 1That's what you get your power from. 1That's where i got my 10 to the minus 5 1because I counted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1You got to count that number just like we did over here. 1And then, everything else will be behind the decimal. 1Let me do another example. 1Let's say I had 0.-- and my wife always point out 1that I have to write a 0 in front of my decimal points 1because she's a doctor. 1And if people don't see the decimal point, 1someone might overdose on some medication. 1So let's write it her way, 0.0000000008192. 1Clearly, this is a super cumbersome number to write. 1And you might forget about a 0 or add too 1many 0's, which could be costly if you're 1doing some important scientific research. 1Or, maybe doing-- well, you wouldn't prescribe medicine 1at this small a dose. 1Or maybe you would, I don't want to get into that. 1But how would I write this in scientific notation? 1So I start off with the first non-zero number, 1if I'm starting from the left. 1So it's going to be 8.192. 1I just put a decimal and write 0.192 times-- times 10 to what? 1Well, I just count. 1Times 10 to the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 1I have to include that number, 10 to the minus 10. 1And I think you'll find it reasonably satisfactory 1that this number is easier to write 1than that number over there. 1Now, and this is another powerful thing 1about scientific notation. 1Let's say I have these two numbers 1and I want to multiply them. 1Let's say I want to multiply the number 0.005 times the number 10.0008. 1This is actually a fairly straightforward one to do, 1but sometimes it can get quite cumbersome. 1And especially if you're dealing with twenty or thirty 10's on either sides of the decimal point. 1Put a 0 here to make my wife happy. 1But when you do it in scientific notation, 1it will actually simplify it. 1This guy can be rewritten as 5 times 10 to the what? 1I have 1, 2, 3 spaces behind the decimal. 110 to the third. 1And then this is 8, so this is times 8 times 110 to the-- sorry, this is 5 times 10 to the minus 3. 1That's very important. 15 times 10 to the 3 would have been 5,000. 1Be very careful about that. 1Now, what is this guy equal to? 1This is 1, 2, 3, 4 places behind the decimal. 1So it's 8 times 10 to the minus 4. 1If we're multiplying these two things, 1this is the same thing as 5 times 10 to the minus 3 1times 8 times 10 to the minus 4. 1There's nothing special about the scientific notation. 1It literally means what it's saying. 1So for multiplying, you could write it out like this. 1And multiplication, order doesn't matter. 1So I could rewrite this as 5 times 8 times 110 to the minus 3 times 10 to the minus 4. 1And then, what is 5 times 8? 15 times 8 we know is 40. 1So it's 40 times 10 to the minus 3 times 10 to the minus 4. 1And if you know your exponent rules, 1you know that when you multiply two numbers that 1have the same base, you can just add their exponents. 1So you just add the minus 3 and the minus 4. 1So it's equal to 40 times 10 to the minus 7. 1Let's do another example. 1Let's say we were to multiply Avogadro's number. 1So we know that's 6.022 times 10 to the 23rd. 1Now, let's say we multiply that times some really small number. 1So times, say, 7.23 times 10 to the minus 22. 1So this is some really small number. 1You're going to have a decimal, and then you're going to have 1twenty one 0's. 1Then you're going ti have a 7 and a 2 and a 3. 1So this is a really small number. 1But the multiplication, when you do it in scientific notation, 1is actually fairly straightforward. 1This is going to be equal to 6.0-- let me write it properly. 16.022 times 10 to the 23rd times 7.23 times 10 to the minus 22. 1We can change the order, so it's equal to 6.022 times 7.23. 1That's that part. 1So you can view it as these first parts 1of our scientific notation times 10 to the 23rd times 10 1to the minus 22. 1And now, this is-- you're going to do 1some little decimal multiplication right here. 1It's going to be-- some number-- 40 something, I think. 1I can't do this one in my head. 1But this part is pretty easy to calculate. 1I'll just leave this the way it is. 1But this part right here, this will be times. 210 to the 23rd times 10 to the minus 22. 2You just add the exponents. 2You get times 10 to the first power. 2And then this number, whatever it's going to equal, 2I'll just leave it out here since I 2don't have a calculator. 20.23. 2Let's see, it will be 7.2. 2Let's see, 0.2 times-- it's like a fifth. 2It'll be like 41-something. 2So this is approximately 41 times 10 to the 1. 2Or, another way is approximately-- 2it's going to be 410-something. 2And to get it right, you just have 2to actually perform this multiplication. 2So hopefully you see that scientific notation is, one, 2really useful for super large and super small numbers. 2And not only is it more useful to kind of understand 2the numbers and to write the numbers, 2but it also simplifies operating on the numbers.",math_pre-algebra_pre-algebra-exponents-radicals
" -  The distribution of resting pulse rates of all students at Santa Maria High School was approximately normal with mean of 80 beats per minute and standard deviation of nine beats per minute. The school nurse plans to provide additional screening to students whose resting pulse rates are in the top 30% of the students who were tested. What is the minimum resting pulse rate at that school for students who will receive additional screening? Round to the nearest whole number. If you feel like you know how to tackle this, I encourage you to pause this video and try to work it out. All right, now let's work this out together. They're telling us that the distribution of resting pulse rates are approximately normal. So we could use a normal distribution. And they tell us several things about this normal distribution. They tell us that the mean is 80 beats per minute. So that is the mean right over there. And they tell us that the standard deviation is nine beats per minute. So on this normal distribution, we have one standard deviation above the mean, two standard deviations above the mean, so this distance right over here is nine. So this would be 89. This one right over here would be 98. And you could also go standard deviations below the mean, this right over here would be 71, this would be 62, but what we're concerned about is the top 30% because that is who is going to be tested. So there's gonna be some value here, some threshold. Let's say it is right over here, that if you are at that score, you have reached the minimum threshold to get an additional screening. You are in the top 30%. So that means that this area right over here is going to be 30% or 0.3. So what we can do, we can use a z-table to say for what z-score is 70% of the distribution less than that. And then we can take that z-score and use the mean and the standard deviation to come up with an actual value. In previous examples, we started with the z-score and were looking for the percentage. This time we're looking for the percentage. We want it to be at least 70% and then come up with the corresponding z-score. So let's see, immediately when we look at this, and we are to the right of the mean, and so we're gonna have a positive z-score. So we're starting at 50% here. We definitely want to get to the 67%, 68, 69, we're getting close and on our table this is the lowest z-score that gets us across that 70% threshold. It's at 0.7019. So it definitely crosses the threshold. And so that is a z-score of 0.53. 0.52 is too little. So we need a z-score of 0.53. Let's write that down. 0.53, right over there, and we just now have to figure out what value gives us a z-score of 0.53. Well, this just means 0.53 standard deviations above the mean. So to get the value, we would take our mean and we would add 0.53 standard deviation. So 0.53 times nine. And this will get us 0.53 times nine is equal to 4.77 plus 80 is equal to 84.77. 84.77 and they want us to round to the nearest whole number. So we will just round to 85 beats per minute. So that's the threshold. If you have that resting heartbeat, then the school nurse is going to give you some additional screening. You are in the top 30% of students who are tested.",math_statistics-probability_modeling-distributions-of-data
" All right, we're doing the California Standards released questions in geometry now. And here's the first question. It says, which of the following best describes deductive reasoning? And I'm not a huge fan of when they ask essentially definitional questions in math class. But we'll do it and hopefully it will help you understand what deductive reasoning is. Although, I do think that deductive reasoning itself is probably more natural than the definition they'll give here. Well, actually before I even look at the definitions, let me tell you what it is. And then we can see which of these definitions matches it. Deductive reasoning is, if I give you a bunch of statements and then from those statements you deduce, or you come to some conclusion that you know must be true. Like if, I said that all boys are tall. If I told you all boys are tall. And if I told you that Bill is a boy. Bill is a boy. That's two separate words, a and boy. So if you say, OK, if these two statements are true, what can you deduce? Well I say well, Bill is a boy and all boys are tall. Then Bill must be tall. You deduced this last statement from these two other statements that you knew were true. And this one has to be true if those two are true. So Bill must be tall. That is deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning. Bill must be tall, not Bill must be deductive. So anyway, you have some statements and you deduce other statements that must be true given those. And you often hear another type of reasoning, inductive reasoning. And that's when you're given a couple of examples and you generalize. Well, I don't want to get too complicated here, because this is a question on deductive reasoning. But generalizations often aren't a good thing. But if you see a couple of examples and you see a pattern there you can often extrapolate and get to a kind of broader generalization. That's inductive reasoning. But that's not what they're asking us about this. Let's see if we can find the definition of deductive reasoning in the California Standards language. Use logic to draw conclusions based on accepted statements. Yeah, well actually that sounds about right. That's what we did here. We used logic to draw conclusions based on accepted statements, which were those two. So I'm going to go with A, so far. Accepting the meaning of a term without definition. Well, I don't even know how one can do that. How do you accept the meaning of something without it having being defined? Let's see, so it's not B. I don't think anything is really B. C, defining mathematical terms to correspond with physical objects. No, that's not really anything related to deductive reasoning either. D, inferring a general truth by examining a number of specific examples. Well, this is more of what I had just talked about, inductive reasoning. So, they want to know what deductive reasoning is, so I'm going to go with A. Use logic to draw conclusions based on accepted statements. Next problem. OK, let me copy and paste the whole thing. Copy and paste is essential with these geometry problems, we won't have to redraw everything. OK, in the diagram below, angle 1, and this right here, you should learn, means congruent. When you say two angles are congruent, so in this case they're saying angle 1 is congruent to angle 4, that means that they have the same angle measure. And the only difference between congruent and being equal is that congruent says they can have the same angle measure, but they could be in different directions. And the rays that come out from them could be of different lengths. Although I'd often say that's equal as well. But if we're dealing with congruency, that's what it means. It essentially just means the angle measures are equal. So we could draw that here. Angle 1 is congruent to angle 4. It just mean that these angle measures are the same. Whether we're measuring them in degrees or radians. All right, now what do they want us to come to a conclusion? Which of the following conclusions does not have to be true? Does not have to be true. Not. Angles 3 and 4 are supplementary angles. What does supplementary mean? That means that angle 3 plus angle 4 have to be equal to 180. This is the definition of a supplementary angle. Supplementary. So angles 3 and 4, they're actually opposite angles. And you can play with these. If you had these two lines and you kind of changed the angle at which they instersect, you would see that angles 3 and 4 are actually going to be congruent angles. They're always going to be equal to each other in measure. So they are equal to each other. And if angle 4 is, we don't know what it is. If angle 4 is 95 degrees, then angle 3 is also going to be 95 degrees. If angle 4 is 30 degrees, angle 3 is also going to be 30 degrees. So I can think of a bunch of cases where this will not be equal to 180. The only way that this would be equal to 180, angle 3 plus angle 4, is if angle 4 were a 90 degree angle, and angle 3 were also a 90 degree angle. But they don't tell us that. All they tell us is that angle 4 and angle 1 are the same, at least when you measure the angles. So I would already go with choice A. That does not have to be true. That'll only be true if both of those angles were 90 degrees. Let's see, line L is parallel to line M. That's true. If that angle is equal to this angle, the best way to think about it is, this angle is also equal to, and you could watch the videos on the angle game that I do. We do this quite a bit. But opposite angles are equal. And that should be intuitive to you at this point. Because you can imagine that if these two lines, if I were to change the angle at which they cross, no matter what angle I do it at, that's always going to be equal to this. So angle 1 is going to congruent to angle 2. And if these two lines are parallel, if L and M are parallel, then 2 and 4 are going to be the same. Or you can think of it the other way. If 4 and 1 are the same, and 1 is the same as 2, then that means 4 is the same as 2. And if 4 and 2 are the same, then that means that these two lines are parallel. So this is definitely true. Angle 1 is congruent to angle 3. Once again, if angle 1 is congruent to angle 4, so those two are congruent, and angle 3 is congruent to angle 4, because they're opposite angles. Or instead of saying congruent, I could say equal. If this is equal to this, and this is equal to this, then this is equal to that. All right. And then, the last one, 2 is congruent to 3. 2 is congruent to 3. Well, by the same logic, if 1 is congruent to 4, and since 1 and 2 are opposite, it's also the same as 2. And 4, because it's opposite of 3, it's congruent to that, all these angles have to be the same thing. So 2 and 3 would also be congruent angles. So all of the other ones must be true, B, C and D. So A is definitely our choice. Next problem. Let me copy and paste it. OK. Consider the arguments below. Every multiple of 4 is even, 376 is a multiple of 4. Therefore, 376 is even. Fair enough. A number can be written as a repeating decimal if it is rational. Pi cannot be written as a repeating decimal. Therefore, pi is not rational. Which ones, if any, use deductive reasoning? OK, so statement one, every multiple of 4 is even. 376 is a multiple of 4. So this is deductive reasoning. Because you know that every multiple of 4 is even. So you pick any multiple of 4, it's going to be even. 376 is a multiple of 4. Therefore, it has to be even. So this is correct logic. So statement one is definitely deductive reasoning. Let's see, statement number two. A number can be written as a repeating decimal if it is rational. So if you're rational, that means that you can write it as a repeating decimal. That's like 0.33333. That's 1/3. That's all they mean by a repeating decimal. But notice, this statement right here, a number can be written as a repeating decimal if it is rational. That doesn't say that a repeating decimal means that it's rational. It just means that a rational number can be written as a repeating decimal. This statement doesn't let us go the other way. It doesn't say that a repeating decimal can definitely be written as a rational number. It just says that if it is rational, a number can be written as a repeating decimal. Fair enough. And then it says pi cannot be written as a repeating decimal. Pi cannot be written as a repeating decimal. So if pi cannot be written as a repeating decimal, pi be rational? Well if pi was rational, if pi was in this set, if pi were rational, then you could write it as a repeating decimal. But it said that you cannot write it as a repeating decimal. So therefore, pi cannot be rational. 1Cannot be in the set of rationals. 1So therefore this is also sound deductive reasoning. 1So both one and two use deductive reasoning. 1As far as I know. 1I'm out of time. 1See you in the next video.",math_geometry-home_geometry-miscellaneous
" Find the range and the mid-range of the following sets of numbers. So what the range tells us is essentially how spread apart these numbers are, and the way you calculate it is that you just take the difference between the largest of these numbers and the smallest of these numbers. And so if we look at the largest of these numbers, I'll circle it in magenta, it looks like it is 94. 94 is larger than every other number here, so that's the largest of the numbers. And from that, we want to subtract the smallest of the numbers. And the smallest of the numbers in our set right over here is 65. So you want to subtract 65 from 94. And this is equal to-- Let's see, if this was 95 minus 65, it would be 30. 94 is one less than that, so it is 29. So the larger this number is, that means the more spread out. The larger the difference between the largest and the smallest number. The smaller this is, that means the tighter the range, just to use the word itself, of the numbers actually are. So that's the range. The mid-range is one way of thinking to some degree of kind of central tendency, so mid-range. And what you do with the mid-range is you take the average of the largest number and the smallest number. So here we took the difference. That's the range. The mid-range would be the average of these two numbers. So it would be 94 plus 65. And when I talk about average, I'm talking about the arithmetic mean over 2. So this is going to be what? 90 plus 60 is 150. 150, 4 plus 5 is 159. 159 divided by 2 is equal to-- 150 divided by 2 is 75. 9 divided by 2 is 4 and 1/2. So this would be 79.5. So it's one kind of way of thinking about the middle of these numbers. Another way is obviously the arithmetic mean, where you actually take the arithmetic mean of everything here. Obviously, you could also look at things like the median and the mode. So range and mid-range.",math_statistics-probability_summarizing-quantitative-data
" -  So we have two different substances here and just for the sake of an argument, let's assume that they are in their liquid state. Well you probably already recognize this substance right here, each molecule has one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, this is water and we have drawn all neat hydrogen bonds right over there. Now this substance, at least right now, might be a little less familiar to you, you might recognize you have an O-H group, and then you have a carbon chain, this tells you that this is an alcohol, and what type of alcohol? Well you have two carbons here, so this is ethyl alcohol or known as ethanol. So this right over here, let me write that down. This is ethanol, which is the primary constituent in the alcohol that people drink, it's also an additive into car fuel, but what I wanna think about here, is if we assume that both of these are in their liquid state and let's say they're hanging out in a cup and we're just at sea level so it's just a standard pressure conditions. Which one is going to be easier to vaporize or which one is going to have more of it's molecules turning into vapor, or I guess you could say turning into vapor more easily? Well you immediately see that they both have hydrogen bonds, you have this hydrogen bond between the partially negative end and the partial positive ends, hydrogen bond between the partial negative end and the partial positive ends. The other thing that you notice is that, I guess you could think of it on a per molecule basis, on average you have fewer hydrogen bonds on the ethanol than you have on the water. Ethanol-- Oxygen is more electronegative, we already know it's more electronegative than hydrogen, it's also more electronegative than carbon, but it's a lot more electronegative than hydrogen. So you have this imbalance here and then on top of that, this carbon, you have a lot more atoms here in which to distribute a partial charge. There could be a very weak partial charge distributed here amongst the carbons but you have a stronger partial charge on the hydrogen but it's not gonna be strong as what you have here because, once again, you have a larger molecule to distribute especially around this carbon to help dissipate charging. So you're gonna have weaker partial charges here and they're occurring in fewer places so you have less hydrogen bonding on the ethanol than you have on the water. Let me write that, you have less hydrogen bonding. As we've already talked about, in the liquid state and frankly, in the solid state as well, the hydrogen bonding is what is keeping these things together, that's what's keeping the water together, flowing next to each other. This is what's keeping the ethanol together. So if you have less hydrogen-- Let me write this down, less hydrogen bonding, it actually has more hydrogen atoms per molecule, but if you have less hydrogen bonding, it's gonna take less energy to break these things free. Before I even talk about breaking things free and these molecules turning into vapors entering their gas state, let's just think about how that happens. When we talk about the temperature of a system, we're really just talking about the average kinetic energy. Each molecule, remember they're all bouncing around in all different ways, this one might have, for example, a much higher kinetic energy than this one. They're all moving in different directions, this one might have a little bit higher, and maybe this one all of a sudden has a really high kinetic energy because it's just been knocked in just the exact right ways and it's enough to overcome both these hydrogen bonds over here and the pressure from the air above it. Remember this isn't happening in a vacuum, you have air up here, air molecules, I'll just draw the generic, you have different types of things, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etcetera etcetera. But if I just draw generic air molecules, there's also some pressure from these things bouncing around but this one might have enough, this particular molecule might have enough kinetic energy to overcome the hydrogen bonds and overcome the pressure from the molecules above it to essentially vaporize, to turn into its gas state. The same thing might be true over here, maybe this is the molecule that has the super high kinetic energy to be able to break free. In that case, it is going to turn into its gaseous state. The hydrogen bonds are gonna break apart, and it's gonna be so far from any of its sibling molecules, I guess you could say, from the other ethanol molecules that it won't be able to form new hydrogen bonds. Same thing with this one, once it vaporizes, it's out in gaseous state, it's much further from any other water molecules, it's not going to be able to form those hydrogen bonds with them. Because there's more hydrogen bonds here to break, than here, you can imagine it would take, on average, more heat to vaporize this thing than to vaporize this thing and that is indeed the case. The term for how much heat do you need to vaporize a certain mass of a substance, you can imagine, is called the heat of vaporization, let me write that down, heat of vaporization and you can imagine, it is higher for water than it is for ethanol and I will give you the numbers here, at least ones that I've been able to look up. I found slightly different numbers, depending on which resource I looked at but what I found for water, the heat of vaporization is 2260 joules per gram or instead of using joules, remember joules is a unit of energy it could be a unit of heat, instead of joules if you wanna think of it in terms of calories, that's equivalent to 541 calories per gram while the heat of vaporization for ethanol is a good bit lower. The heat of vaporization for ethanol--let me make this clear this right over here is water, that's for water. The same thing for ethanol. The heat of vaporization for ethanol is, based on what I looked up, is 841 joules per gram or if we wanna write them as calories, 201 calories per gram which means it would require, roughly, 201 calories to evaporate, to fully vaporize a gram of ethanol at standard temperature, keeping the temperature constant. We could talk more about that in other videos, but the big thing that we're talking about here is, look, it requires less energy to vaporize this thing and you can run the experiment, take a glass of water, equivalent glasses, fill them up the same amount of time, a glass of water and a glass of ethanol and then see how long it takes. You can put a heat lamp on top of them or you could just put them outside where they're experiencing the same atmospheric conditions, the same sun's rays and see what's the difference-- how much more energy, how much more time does it take for the water to evaporate than the ethanol. There's a similar idea here which is boiling point. We've all boiled things, boiling point is the point at which the vapor pressure from the substance has become equal to and starts to overcome the pressure from just a regular atmospheric pressure. And so you can imagine that water has a higher temperature at which it starts to boil than ethanol and that is indeed the case. Water's boiling point is exactly 100° Celsius, in fact, water's boiling point was an important data point for even establishing the Celsius scale, so by definition, it's 100° Celsius, while ethanol's boiling point is approximately 78° Celsius. So it boils at a much lower temperature an that's because there's just fewer hydrogen bonds to actually break.",science_biology_water-acids-and-bases
" We're on problem 51. And they say, a diagram from a proof of the Pythagorean theorem is pictured below. And they they say, which statement would not be used in the proof of the Pythagorean theorem? So since they have drawn this diagram out, I think we might as well just kind of do the proof and then we can look at their choices and see which ones kind of match up to what we did. Hopefully, they do it the same way. And this is a pretty neat proof of the Pythagorean theorem. I don't think I've done it yet. So I might as well do it now. Well, let's figure out what the area of this large square is right. Well there's two ways to think about it you could just say, OK, this is a square. That's a, that's b. Well this is going to be b as well. This is going to be a as well. So the area of the square is going to be the length of one of its sides squared. So we could say the whole square's area is a plus b squared. And that's equal to a squared plus 2ab plus b squared. Fair enough. Now we can also say that the area of this larger square, and it's a bit of an optical illusion, it looks like it's tilted to the left because of the way it's drawn. But anyway, that the area of this larger square is also the area of these four triangles plus the area of this smaller square. So this, the area of the larger square, which we figured out just by taking one side of it and squaring it, that should be equal to the area of the four smaller triangles. So there's four of them. And what's the area of each of them. Let's see, let's just pick this one. 1/2 base times height. So it's 1/2 times a times b. So 1/2 ab is one of these and I multiply by 4 to get all four of these triangles. And then we want to add the area of this inside square. And that's just going to be c squared. So plus c squared. Let's see if we can simplify this. So you get a squared plus 2ab plus b squared is equal to 4 times 1/2 is 2ab plus c squared. Well, we could subtract 2ab from both sides of this equation. The top and the bottom of this equation the way I've written it. But if we do that, subtract 2ab from there, subtract 2ab from there, and you're left with a squared plus b squared is equal to c squared, which is the Pythagorean theorem. And we've proved it. So let's see which of their choices matches what we did. OK, which statement would not be used in the proof of the Pythagorean theorem. The area of a triangle equals 1/2 ab. We used that. The four right triangles are congruent. No, we used that. The area of the inner square is equal to half of the area of the larger square. We didn't use that. I think this is the one that would not be used in the proof. Choice D, the area of the larger square is equal to the sum of the squares of the smaller square and the four congruent triangles. No, that that was the crux of the proof. So we definitely used that. So C is our answer. That's the statement that would not be used in the proof. I'm learning to copy and paste ahead of time. So I don't waste your time. All right, a right triangle's hypotenuse has length 5. If one leg has length 2, what is the length of the other leg? Pythagorean theorem, x squared plus 2 squared is equal to 5 squared, because 5 is the hypotenuse. x squared plus 4 is equal to 25. Subtract 4 from both sides. x squared is equal to 21. So x is equal to the square root of 21. So choice B. Next question. A new pipeline is being constructed to reroute oil flow around the exterior of a national wildlife preserve. I guess that's the national wildlife preserve. The plan showing the old pipeline and the new route is shown below. OK, how many extra miles will the oil flow once the new route is establised. So the new route is going to be 60 miles plus 32 miles. So the new route is 92 miles. So what was the old route? Well the old route was the hypotenuse of this triangle. So we could say, let's call that x. 60 squared plus 32 squared is equal to x squared. Because that's the hypotenuse. And these numbers, that's a bit of a pain to deal with. Maybe if I can factor out something here I can make it more interesting. So I don't have to multiply out 60 squared and 32 squared and all of the rest. Well, let me see. Both of those are divisible by 4. So then I would have 15 and 8. Yeah, that still doesn't make it that useful. So I'll just multiply them out. So this is 3600. At 32 squared, let's see, 32 times 32. 2 times 32 is 64. 3 times 2 is 6. 3 times 3 is 9. So it's 1024. Plus 1024 is equal to x squared. So let me just switch both sides. x squared is equal to 3600 plus 1024 is 4624. Let me see if I can get an approximate. So x is going to be the square root of this thing right here. So let's see if I can get a handle at least on the magnitude of where this would be. So 20 times 20 is 400. So this is way too small. 60 times 60 is 3600. So 68 times 68, this looks right. Especially because 8 times 8 should end in a 4. Let me try that out. 68 times 68. 8 times 8 is 64. 8 times 6 is 48 plus 6 is 54. 6 times 8, 48. 6 times 6, 36 plus 4 is 40. 4624. So x is 68. Oh, I used 68, I shouldn't have. Because they don't want to know how long was the old pipeline. That's 68. It just happened to be one of the choices. That's just to make sure that you read the question properly. But they want to know how much longer is going to be the new pipeline. So the new one was 92. And the old one is 68. Good thing they had that number there so I could try it out. That was the square root of 4624. So how much longer is the new one? Well 92 minus 68 that's 24 miles. So choice A. Not choice B. B is how long the old pipeline was. We want to know how much longer the new route is. That was tricky. Well not tricky, but I kind of fell for it by forgetting what the question was about. Anyway, next question. Marcia is using a straightedge and compass to do the construction below. Interesting. Which best describes the construction Marcia is doing. So, I assume when they say construction she's drawing something. Let's see what it looks like. It looks she's taking her compass, she's probably putting one of the points here, she put one of the points there and then she kind of drew this arc. And then it looks like she put the point there and then she drew that arc. And then she put the point here and drew that arc. And then put the point there and drew that arc. And the end result, it seems like the reason why she picked this point here is it goes through this line L. So she's probably trying to find another point here, so that she can draw another line. Because they say she has a straightedge. A straightedge is to draw these lines. A compass is to draw these curves. So if she were to draw another line between these two points, it looks something like that, then she would have parallel lines. The reason why she would have parallel lines is because these would be corresponding angles and they would be congruent. And so if you have a transversal the corresponding angles are congruent, you're dealing with parallel lines. So my read of this question is that she's probably trying to draw a line that is parallel to L. A line through P parallel to line L. Yeah, that's what I think she's trying to do. All right, choice A. 55. Given angle A. So given this angle. 1What is the first step in constructing the angle 1bisector of angle A? 1OK, well actually I've never done this. 1But I can assume that if I have a compass. 1You know what a compass is, it has those two points. 1One of them is like a pivot point. 1It looks something like this. 1It looks like it has a little pivot point, and then on the 1other side you can stick your pencil. 1And you can adjust it up here. 1And the bottom line, you pivot around this and then you can 1draw circles of arbitrary radiuses. 1It seems like that's what they did here. 1So if I want to draw the angle bisector of a, just thinking 1about it, it seems I could put the pivot point here, and then 1I can put the pencil and I can draw this circle. 1And really, as long as I just find the two points that it 1intersects those two lines or those two rays, 1then I'll be fine. 1And I could have done it anywhere. 1I could have done it here. 1I could have done it out here. 1They just picked points B and C. 1And then from each of those points, you can 1put your pivot here. 1If you put your pivot here, and then you were to draw a 1circle around that, you would have gotten 1this one right here. 1And then if you were to put your pivot point right here, 1draw a circle, you would be able to draw that. 1And then where they interect, that would that would give you 1an indication of where the angle bisector is. 1And you could then draw that line to where they intersect. 1So let's see, they say what is the first step in constructing 1the angle bisector of angle a. 1So they say draw ray AD. 1Well that seems like that would be the last step. 1Then you're done. 1Draw AD, that is the angle biector. 1Draw a line segment connecting points B and C. 1No, that's useless. 1You don't need a line segment. 1I mean even what they have drawn, that's an arc. 1It's not a line. 1From points B and C, draw equal arcs that 1intersect at D. 1That was the second step. 1You have to have points B and C before you can draw those 1equal arcs. 1From point A, draw an arc that intersects the side of the 1angle at points B and C. 1Yeah, that's what we said. 1That was the first step. 1Put your pivot here, and use your pencil to draw the arc. 1You say OK, this point and this point. 1So that would be the first step. 1D. 1And I'm all out of problems and I'm out of time. 1See you in the next video.",math_geometry-home_geometry-miscellaneous
" -  Farmer Jan is a vegetable farmer who divides his field between broccoli crops and spinach crops. Last year, he grew six tons of broccoli per acre, so six tons of broccoli per acre, and nine tons of spinach, nine tons of spinach per acre, for a total of 93 tons of vegetables. This year, he grew two tons of broccoli per acre, so this year, he grew two tons of broccoli per acre, and three tons of spinach per acre, and three tons of spinach per acre, for a total of 31 tons of vegetables. How many acres of broccoli crops and how many acres of spinach crops does Farmer Jan have? So let's think about this. So let's say that the number of acres of broccoli crops, let's call that B, and let's say the acres of spinach crops, acres of spinach crops, let's call that S. So how much broccoli is he going to grow in, I guess you could say, last year? Last year, how much broccoli did he grow? And let me just write this down. This is last year. Last year. And they tell us, last year he grew six tons of broccoli per acre. So if he grew six tons of broccoli per acre, and he has B acres, well, that means he grew six tons per acre times B acres. So he grew 6B tons of broccoli last year. And by the same logic, he grew how much spinach? Well, nine tons of spinach per acre times S acres. So 9S tons of spinach, and then the total is 93 tons, so for a total of 93 tons of vegetables. So this is going to be equal to 93. So now let's think about this year. And in general, when you tackle these, just think about, well, set the variables in general to what they're asking for, and then, how can you use the information that they're giving us? So this year, how much broccoli would he have grown? Well, he grew two tons of broccoli per acre, so he grew two tons per acre. He has the same number of acres. We can assume that. So two tons per acre times B acres is gonna be 2B tons of broccoli. And by that same logic, it's going to be, he grew three tons of spinach per acre. Well, he has S acres. Each of those acres, he's growing three tons of spinach per acre, so it's going to be 3S tons of spinach. And they tell us what that total is. That total is, for a total of 31 tons of vegetables. So this is going to be equal to 31. And so now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, that we can use to solve for B and S. So let's see. What do we wanna solve for first? Well, what we could do, let me rewrite the top equation. So we have 6B plus, plus 9S is equal to 93, is equal to 93. And the second equation, we'll let's try to eliminate the Bs. So let's multiply the second equation by negative three. I'm gonna multiply the left hand side by negative three, and I'm gonna multiply the right hand side by negative three. What am I going to get? Negative three times 2B is negative 6B. That was the whole point by multiplying it by negative three. Negative three times 3S is negative 9S, negative 9S. And then, negative three times 31 is going to be negative 93. So what do we get if we now add the two sides of these equations? So on the left hand side, 6B minus 6B, that's zero. 9S minus 9S, that's zero. We're gonna get just zero. On the right hand side we get 93 minus 93. Well, that's still just going to be zero. So we have this situation where we get zero equals zero, which is going to be true no matter what X and Y are, and so this is a system with an infinite number of solutions. So this has infinite, infinite number of solutions. So one way we could think about it is, these two constraints, they're not giving us enough information. There's an infinite number of B and S combinations that would satisfy these equations, so they're not giving us enough information to say exactly what B and S are. So there is not enough, not enough info! Put an exclamation mark there.",math_algebra_systems-of-equations
" Find the domain of f of x is equal to the principal square root of 2x minus 8. So the domain of a function is just the set of all of the possible valid inputs into the function, or all of the possible values for which the function is defined. And when we look at how the function is defined, right over here, as the square root, the principal square root of 2x minus 8, it's only going to be defined when it's taking the principal square root of a non-negative number. And so 2x minus 8, it's only going to be defined when 2x minus 8 is greater than or equal to 0. It can be 0, because then you just take the square root of 0 is 0. It can be positive. But if this was negative, then all of a sudden, this principle square root function, which we're assuming is just the plain vanilla one for real numbers, it would not be defined. So this function definition is only defined when 2x minus 8 is greater than or equal to 0. And then we could say if 2x minus 8 has to be greater than or equal to 0, we can solve this inequality to see what it's saying about what x has to be. So if we add 8 to both sides of this inequality, you get-- so let me just add 8 to both sides. These 8's cancel out. You get 2x is greater than or equal to 8. 0 plus 8 is 8. And then you divide both sides by 2. Since 2 is a positive number, you don't have to swap the inequality. So you divide both sides by 2. And you get x needs to be greater than or equal to 4. So the domain here is the set of all real numbers that are greater than or equal to 4. x has to be greater than or equal to 4. Or another way of saying it is this function is defined when x is greater than or equal to 4. And we're done.",math_algebra-home_alg-radical-eq-func
" -  What we're going to do in this video is prove that the limit as theta approaches zero of sine of theta over theta is equal to one. So let's start with a little bit of a geometric or trigonometric construction that I have here. So this white circle, this is a unit circle, that we'll label it as such. So it has radius one, unit circle. So what does the length of this salmon-colored line represent? Well, the height of this line would be the y-coordinate of where this radius intersects the unit circle. And so by definition, by the unit circle definition of trig functions, the length of this line is going to be sine of theta. If we wanted to make sure that also worked for thetas that end up in the fourth quadrant, which will be useful, we can just insure that it's the absolute value of the sine of theta. Now what about this blue line over here? Can I express that in terms of a trigonometric function? Well, let's think about it. What would tangent of theta be? Let me write it over here. Tangent of theta is equal to opposite over adjacent. So if we look at this broader triangle right over here, this is our angle theta in radians. This is the opposite side. The adjacent side down here, this just has length one. Remember, this is a unit circle. So this just has length one, so the tangent of theta is the opposite side. The opposite side is equal to the tangent of theta. And just like before, this is going to be a positive value for sitting here in the first quadrant but I want things to work in both the first and the fourth quadrant for the sake of our proof, so I'm just gonna put an absolute value here. So now that we've done, I'm gonna think about some triangles and their respective areas. So first, I'm gonna draw a triangle that sits in this wedge, in this pie piece, this pie slice within the circle, so I can construct this triangle. And so let's think about the area of what I am shading in right over here. How can I express that area? Well, it's a triangle. We know that the area of a triangle is 1/2 base times height. We know the height is the absolute value of the sine of theta and we know that the base is equal to one, so the area here is going to be equal to 1/2 times our base, which is one, times our height, which is the absolute value of the sine of theta. I'll rewrite it over here. I can just rewrite that as the absolute value of the sine of theta over two. Now let's think about the area of this wedge that I am highlighting in this yellow color. So what fraction of the entire circle is this going to be? If I were to go all the way around the circle, it would be two pi radians, so this is theta over to two pis of the entire circle and we know the area of the circle. This is a unit circle, it has a radius one, so it'd be times the area of the circle, which would be pi times the radius square, the radius is one, so it's just gonna be times pi. And so the area of this wedge right over here, theta over two. And if we wanted to make this work for thetas in the fourth quadrant, we could just write an absolute value sign right over there 'cause we're talking about positive area. And now let's think about this larger triangle in this blue color, and this is pretty straightforward. The area here is gonna be 1/2 times base times height. So the area, and once again, this is this entire are, that's going to be 1/2 times our base, which is one, times our height, which is the absolute value of tangent of theta. And so I can just write that down as the absolute value of the tangent of theta over two. Now, how would you compare the areas of this pink or this salmon-colored triangle which sits inside of this wedge and how do you compare that area of the wedge to the bigger triangle? Well, it's clear that the area of the salmon triangle is less than or equal to the area of the wedge and the area of the wedge is less than or equal to the area of the big, blue triangle. The wedge includes the salmon triangle plus this area right over here, and then the blue triangle includes the wedge plus it has this area right over here. So I think we can feel good visually that this statement right over here is true and I'm just gonna do a little bit of algebraic manipulation. Let me multiply everything by two so I can rewrite that the absolute value of sine of theta is less than or equal to the absolute value of theta which is less than or equal to the absolute value of tangent of theta, and let's see. Actually, instead of writing the absolute value of tangent of theta, I'm gonna rewrite that as the absolute value of sine of theta over the absolute value of cosine of theta. That's gonna be the same thing as the absolute value of tangent of theta. And the reason why I did that is we can now divide everything by the absolute value of sine of theta. Since we're dividing by a positive quantity, it's not going to change the direction of the inequalities. So let's do that I'm gonna divide this by an absolute value of sine of theta. I'm gonna divide this by an absolute value of the sine of theta and then I'm gonna divide this by an absolute value of the sine of theta. And what do I get? Well, over here, I get a one and on the right-hand side, I get a one over the absolute value of cosine theta. These two cancel out. So the next step I'm gonna do is take the reciprocal of everything. And so when I take the reciprocal of everything, that actually will switch the inequalities. The reciprocal of one is still going to be one but now, since I'm taking the reciprocal of this here, it's gonna be greater than or equal to the absolute value of the sine of theta over the absolute value of theta, and that's going to be greater than or equal to the reciprocal of one over the absolute value of cosine of theta is the absolute value of cosine of theta. We really just care about the first and fourth quadrants. You can think about this theta approaching zero from that direction or from that direction there, so that would be the first and fourth quadrants. So if we're in the first quadrant and theta is positive, sine of theta is gonna be positive as well. And if we're in the fourth quadrant and theta's negative, well, sine of theta is gonna have the same sign. It's going to be negative as well. And so these absolute value signs aren't necessary. In the first quadrant, sine of theta and theta are both positive. In the fourth quadrant, they're both negative, but when you divide them, you're going to get a positive value, so I can erase those. If we're in the first or fourth quadrant, our X value is not negative, and so cosine of theta, which is the x-coordinate on our unit circle, is not going to be negative, and so we don't need the absolute value signs over there. Now, we should pause a second because we're actually almost done. We have just set up three functions. You could think of this as f of x is equal to, you could view this as f of theta is equal to one, g of theta is equal to this, and h of theta is equal to that. And over the interval that we care about, we could say for negative pi over two is less than theta is less than pi over two, but over this interval, this is true for any theta over which these functions are defined. Sine of theta over theta is defined over this interval, except where theta is equal to zero. But since we're defined everywhere else, we can now find the limit. So what we can say is, well, by the squeeze theorem or by the sandwich theorem, if this is true over the interval, then we also know that the following is true. And this, we deserve a little bit of a drum roll. The limit as theta approaches zero of this is going to be greater than or equal to the limit as theta approaches zero of this, which is the one that we care about, sine of theta over theta, which is going to be greater than or equal to the limit as theta approaches zero of this. Now this is clearly going to be just equal to one. This is what we care about. And this, what's the limit as theta approaches zero of cosine of theta? Well, cosine of zero is just one and it's a continuous function, so this is just gonna be one. So let's see. This limit is going to be less than or equal to one and it's gonna be greater than or equal to one, so this must be equal to one and we are done.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-limits-new
" Let's see if we can write 0.15 as a fraction. So the important thing here is to look at what place these digits are in. So this 1 right over here, this is in the tenths place, so you could view that as 1 times 1/10. This 5 right over here is in the hundredths place, so you could view that as 5 times 1/100. So if I were to rewrite this, I can rewrite this as the sum of-- this 1 represents 1 times 1/10, so that would literally be 1/10 plus-- and this 5 represents 5 times 1/100, so it would be plus 5/100. And if we want to add them up, we want to find a common denominator. The common denominator is 100. Both 10 and-- the least common multiple. 100 is a multiple of both 10 and 100. So we can rewrite this as something over 100 plus something over 100. This isn't going to change. This was already 5/100. If we multiply the denominator here by 10-- that's what we did; we multiplied it by 10-- then we're going to have to multiply this numerator by 10. And so this is the same thing as 10/100. And now we're ready to add. This is the same thing as-- 10 plus 5 is 15/100. And you could have done that a little bit quicker just by inspecting this. You would say, look, my smallest place right over here is in the hundredths place. Instead of calling this 1/10, I could call this literally 10/100. Or I could say this whole thing is 15/100. And now if I want to reduce this to lowest terms, we can-- let's see, both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by 5. So let's divide them both by 5. And so the numerator, 15 divided by 5, is 3. The denominator, 100 divided by 5, is 20. And that's about as simplified as we can get.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_imp-decimals
" Welcome back. We're ready to do part D, and let me copy and paste that in as well. See, I don't think that's going to need this graph, so let me just remove that with a color other than yellow. It's copy and pasted. I don't know if you can read it, but it's helpful for me to review the problem on our clipboard. OK. The rate at which tickets were sold for t -- for over this range is modeled by r of t-- let me write that in case you can't see it-- is the rate at which tickets were sold. r of t is equal to 550 te to the minus t over 2 tickets per hour. Based on the model, how many tickets were sold by  PM? So my t equals 3-- to the nearest whole number? So that's sometimes important. You don't want to give a decimal answer. So this is the rate at which tickets are sold. So this is the derivative of the total tickets sold function. Or another way that we could write it is the total tickets sold-- so let's call that, I don't know, capital T sub-- well let me-- I don't want to do T of t, that's [UNINTELLIGIBLE] So let's say the tickets sold as a function of time is going to be equal to the definite integral-- well, we could say is at any time t, the tickets sold-- and this is the fundamental theorems calculus, I think it might be one of its correlaries or actually sometimes it is the fundamental theorem of calculus, I always forget my definitions. Between time equals 0 and t-- or if we want to know the tickets sold, between time equals 0 and t is equal to the integral of the rate at which the tickets sold was changing. So that's equal to 550te to the minus t over 2dt. Right? That's it. And so if we want to know how many tickets were sold at time equals 3, that's just equal to the definite integral from 0 to 3, or we could also view it as the area under this curve, from time equals 0 to time equal to 3 of 550te to the minus t over 2dt. Now this integral right here, you can solve it analytically using integration of parts, which I just called the reverse product rule, but you only have 45 minutes to do all three of these problems, and they'll let you use your graphing calculator, and your graphic calculator is excellent at doing definite integrals, and they just want the number, right? So let's use our graphic calculators to get that number. Let's see. I don't want to copy, so how do we do that? We just do second the division button but that's calc-- definite, let me use the definite integral, and like what was, let's see, let me make sure I have that-- 550 let's just use x. 550 times x times second e to the minus x divided by 2. I think that's the whole function. And let's see. My independent variable is x, I've just swapped t for x there, and I'm taking the integral from 0 to 3. Click enter, let the calculator do the work. This would have taken you quite a while if you had to actually do the integral yourself. 972.78, and they want us to round to the nearest whole number. So the nearest whole number is 973. So we say 973 tickets sold by  PM. And we're done. That only took us four minutes. And it would have taken us even less if we didn't have to explain it. Anyway. I will see you in problem number three.",math_calculus-all-old_ap-calc-topic
" -  We're told that six identical potato core cubes were isolated from a potato. The initial weight of each cube was recorded. Each cube was then placed in one of six open beakers, each containing a different sucrose solution. The cubes remained in the beakers for 24 hours at a constant temperature of 23 degrees Celsius. After 24 hours, the cubes were removed from the beakers, blotted, and reweighed. The percent change in mass, due to a net gain or loss of water, was calculated for each cube, and the results are shown in the graph to the right, so, this graph right over here. A straight line is drawn on the graph to help estimate results from other sucrose concentrations not tested. Using the straight line on the graph, calculate the water potential, in bars, of the potato core cubes at 23 degrees Celsius. Give your answer to one decimal place. So, pause this video and see if you can work that out. All right, so, first, let's just make sure we're understanding what's going on here. So, there was a potato. We took six cubes from that potato and we stuck those six cubes into six different sucrose molarity solutions, and so, this data point right over here, this was the situation where we took one of the cubes, so, this was a sucrose solution. This was a solution, actually, that contained no sucrose, and so, when we put the cube in that solution, we saw a net gain of mass. It looks like it's about 22% gain in mass, and so, that would have happened because water would have flowed into the cube. Now, at the other extreme, right over here, this is a solution that has a lot of sucrose. It had a very high sucrose concentration, and when we put a cube in there, we see that the mass of that cube went down by 25%, and that would have been because of the net outflow of water from that cube. So, how do we figure out the water potential of the core cubes at 23 degrees Celsius? Well, we could think about a situation where there's some sucrose concentration where, if the cube and the sucrose solution have the same water potential, then you're not going to have any net inflow or outflow, and so, where do we see that on the graph? Well, what we'd wanna do, we have that line where they're trying to fit the data points, and so, where would we expect to see 0% change in mass? So, we would go right over here to 0% change in mass. We would go to the line right over there, and then, we see that this line would say that there's a 0% change in mass. See, if this is 0.4 right over here, this is 0.5 right over here, so, this is about a 0.44 molar sucrose solution, 0.44 molar solution. So, if we can figure out the water potential of this 0.44 molar sucrose solution, well, that's also going to be the water potential of the potato cubes. Well, how do we do that? Well, we've seen the equation before where we introduced ourselves to the idea of water potential, that water potential, using the Greek letter psi, is going to be equal to the solute potential plus the pressure potential. Now, we're dealing with all open containers. We don't have anything that's some piston or something that's pressing down on these containers, and so, because of that, the pressure potential is going to be equal to zero, and so, we just have to figure out the solute potential. So, the solute potential, we have introduced ourselves to this formula in previous videos. It's negative i times C times R times T. This i right over here, this is our ionization constant. This is, since we're dealing with sucrose solutions, it says okay, if I took sucrose and put it into water, every one of those sucrose molecules, does it stay one molecule, or does it disassociate? Well, sucrose doesn't disassociate at all. It just stays one molecule, so, this would be one. If we were dealing with, say, sodium chloride, each sodium chloride molecule would disassociate into a sodium ion and a chloride ion, and so, then, this would be two, but this was one for sucrose. C is the molarity of our solution, and so, we estimated that to be 0.44, so, let me write this down. Our solute water potential is going to be equal to negative one times 0.4, 0.44, I should say, and that's going to be moles. I'll write out all the units. Moles per liter times, it's sometimes called the pressure constant in this context, but this is also the universal gas constant, and if you were doing something like the AP exam, they would give you what this is. So, this is 0.0831 liters times bars, all of that over mole Kelvin. If you're used to seeing other values of this, it's probably because they're dealing with other units right over here, but this is the universal gas constant. And then, we have to multiply that times the temperature that we're dealing with in Kelvin. Now, it's 23 degrees Celsius. To convert to Kelvin, we just add to 273, so, 273 plus 23 is going to be 296, 296 Kelvin, and so, this is going to be equal to, we have a negative here, and we could look at the units. We have the liter canceling out liters, moles canceling out with moles, Kelvin canceling out with Kelvin, so, we're going to get something in bars, which makes sense. That is the unit for our water potential. And then, we get the calculator out. So, we have 0.44 times 0.831 times 296, 296, is equal to, and they want us to round our answer to one decimal place, so, approximately 10.8, and we already had that negative out front, so, negative 10.8 bars, and we're done.",science_ap-biology_cell-structure-and-function
" We are told that the cosine of 58 degrees is roughly equal to 0.53. And that's roughly equal to, because it just keeps going on and on. I just rounded it to the nearest hundredth. And then we're asked, what is the sine of 32 degrees? And I encourage you to pause this video and try it on your own. And a hint is to look at this right triangle. One of the angles is already labeled 32 degrees. Figure out what all of the angles are, and then use the fundamental definitions, your sohcahtoa definitions, to see if you can figure out what sine of 32 degrees is. So I'm assuming you've given a go at it. Let's work it through now. So we know that the sum of the angles of a triangle add up to 180. Now in a right angle, one of the angles is 90 degrees. So that means that the other two must add up to 90. These two add up to 90 plus another 90 is going to be 180 degrees. Or another way to think about is that the other two non-right angles are going to be complementary. So what plus 32 is equal to 90? Well, 90 minus 32 is 58. So this right over here is going to be 58 degrees. Well, why is that interesting? Well, we already know what the cosine of 58 degrees is equal to. But let's think about it in terms of ratios of the lengths of sides of this right triangle. Let's just write down sohcahtoa. Soh, sine, is opposite over hypotenuse. Cah, cosine, is adjacent over hypotenuse. Toa, tangent, is opposite over adjacent. So we could write down the cosine of 58 degrees, which we already know. If we think about it in terms of these fundamental ratios, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. This is a 58 degree angle. The side that is adjacent to it is-- let me do it in this color-- is side BC right over here. It's one of the sides of the angle, the side of the angle that is not the hypotenuse. The other side, this over here, is a hypotenuse. So this is going to be the adjacent, the length of the adjacent side, BC, over the length of the hypotenuse. The length of the hypotenuse, well, that is AB. Now let's think about what the sine of 32 degrees would be. Well, sine is opposite over hypotenuse. So now we're looking at this 32 degree angle. What side is opposite it? Well, it opens up onto BC. And what's the length of the hypotenuse? It's AB. Notice, the sine of 32 degrees is BC over AB. The cosine of 58 degrees is BC over AB. Or another way of thinking about it, the sine of this angle is the same thing as the cosine of this angle. So we could literally write the sine-- I want to do that in that pink color-- the sine of 32 degrees is equal to the cosine of 58 degrees, which is roughly equal to 0.53. And this is a really, really useful property. The sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complement. So we could write this in general terms. We could write that the sine of some angle is equal to the cosine of its complement, is equal to the cosine of 90 minus theta. Think about it. I could change this entire problem. Instead of making this the sine of 32 degrees, I could make this the sine of 25 degrees. And if someone gave you the cosine of-- what's 90 minus 25?-- if someone gave you the cosine of 65 degrees, then you could think about this as 25. The complement is going to be right over here. This would be 65 degrees. And then you could use the exact same idea.",math_geometry_hs-geo-trig
" Let g of x equal cosine of x. So let's actually graph that. So that would be the graph right over there. I drew it ahead of time. So this is a segment of cosine of x between x is equal to 0 and x equals pi. Obviously, it keeps on going in both directions after that. And then they ask us, what is the limit as h approaches 0 of g of pi plus h minus g of pi over h? So let's just think about it a little bit. So they are concerning themselves with g of pi. So let's look at the point pi comma g of pi. So that right there is the point pi comma g of pi. And they're also concerning themselves with g of pi plus h. So let's say that this right over here is the x value pi plus h. And then this right over here would be the point pi plus h, g of pi plus h-- would be this point right over here. And they're essentially trying to find the slope between these two points. If we wanted to find the slope between these points, it would be change in our y value over change in x, or change in the vertical over change in the horizontal. What is our change in the vertical? What is the change in the vertical? Well, the change in the vertical, we'll take this y value here-- so g of pi plus h. We'll subtract this y value here-- minus g of pi. So that was our change in the vertical over the change in the horizontal. Well, what is that going to be? Well that's going to be pi plus h minus pi. And this is exactly what we have or, before we take the limit, what we have right over here. So this is going to be g of pi plus h minus g of pi, all of that over-- these pi's cancel out-- all of that over h. Now, so this is the slope, this slope the way I've-- it's a slope of the secant line right over here. Now let's think about what is going to happen as h gets closer and closer to 0. So the way I've drawn it right over here, that means that this point is going to go further and further to the left. This point is going to go further and further and further to the left. So pi plus h, as h approaches 0, is going to approach pi. If we assumed h was a negative value, then we would be approaching from here. But what is going to happen as h becomes smaller and smaller and smaller? Well, the point pi plus h, g of pi plus h is going to get closer and closer to this point. And the slope of those secant lines-- I know it's hard to see, because it's small here-- they're going to start getting closer and closer to the slope of the tangent line right at x equals pi. So this right over here really is another way of saying the slope of the tangent line at x equals pi. Well, what does that look like? Well the slope of the tangent line, we're at a minimum point at x equals pi right over here. Cosine of pi we know is a negative 1. That's a minimum value. It's one of the minimum values. It keeps going to that for cosine of x. And so its tangent line is just going to be a horizontal line. So we know that this right over here is going to be 0. Now, there are other ways you could have tackled it. We don't have the tools right now to do it purely algebraically-- to say cosine of pi plus h minus cosine of pi. There are ways to do it. But we're not going to do that now. The other option that you could do is use a calculator. So for example, you could say, well, OK, let's just take very small h's and just evaluate them. So we'll evaluate cosine of pi plus some h minus cosine of pi over that small h. And we're going to get smaller and smaller h's here. And so actually, let's try to do that. That could be interesting. So let me clear this. So let's just take a really, really small h's, h's getting really, really close to 0. So let me make sure I'm in Radian mode, first of all. I'm in Degree. So let me fix that. All right, perfect. And now let me take cosine of pi. I'll take a reasonably small h, 0.1, minus cosine of pi. I always forget where the pi is. So that's the numerator. And then let me divide that by the same h, by 0.1. So this is just my previous answer divided by 0.1. So I get 0.04. Now let me make h even smaller. And I'll actually do in one expression, actually, this time. So cosine of-- actually, make it a lot smaller-- of pi plus 0.0001-- so 1/10,000 more than pi, right over there-- minus cosine of pi. And now we are going to divide by this h, 0.0001. And what do we get? 5 times 10 to the negative 5th-- so you see clearly that we're getting to some really, really, really, really small numbers, that this expression is approaching 0.",math_old-differential-calculus_derivative-intro-dc
" We have this strange looking shape here, and then we're given some of its dimensions. We know that this side right over here has a length of 3.5. This side over here is 6.5. Then we know from here to here is 2, and then from here to here is 7. And then they're giving us this dimension right over here is 3.5. So given that, let's see if we can find the area of this entire figure. And I encourage you to pause the video right now and try this on your own. I assume you've given a go at it. And there might be a few things that jump out at you immediately. The first thing is that they have these two triangles up here. And they give us all of the dimensions for them, or at least they give us the base and the height for it, which is enough to figure out the area. If I had a rectangle that was 2 units wide and 3.5 units high, if we know that it would have an area of 2 times 3.5. Now a triangle is just going to be, especially a triangle like this, a right triangle, is just going to be half of a rectangle like this. We just care about half of its area. So this area is going to be 1/2 times 2 times 3.5. 1/2 times 2 is equal to 1. 1 times 3.5 is 3.5 square units. So the area of that part is going to be 3.5 square units. Let's think about the area of this triangle right over here. Well, once again we have its height is 3.5. Its base is 7. So its area is going to be 1/2 times 7 times 3.5. 1/2 times 7 is 3.5 times 3.5. So this part is 3.5, and I'm going to multiply that times 3.5 again. Let's figure out what that product is equal to. 3.5 times 3.5. 5 times 5 is 25. 3 times 5 is 15, plus 2 is 17. Let's cross that out. Move one place over to the left. 3 times 5 is 15. 3 times 3 is 9, plus 1 is 10. So that gets us to 5 plus 0 is 5. 7 plus 5 is 12, carry the 1. 1 plus 1 is 2. And we have a 1. We have two digits to the right of the decimal, one, two. So we're going to have two digits to the right of the decimal in the answer. The area here is 12.25 square units. Now this region may be a little bit more difficult, because it's kind of us this weird trapezoid looking thing. But one thing that might pop out at you is that you can divide it very easily into a rectangle and a triangle. And we can actually figure out the dimensions that we need to figure out the areas of each of these. We know what the width of this rectangle is, or the length of this rectangle, whatever you want to call it. It's going to be 2 units plus 7 units. So this is going to be 9. We know that this distance is 3.5. If this distance right over here is 3.5, then this distance down here has to add up with 3.5 to 6.5, so this must be 3. Now we can actually figure out the area. The area of this rectangle is just going to be its height times its length, or 9 times 3.5. 9 times 3.5. And one way you could do it-- we could even try to do this in our head-- this is going to be 9 times 3 plus 9 times 0.5. 9 times 3 is 27. 9 times 0.5, that's just half of nine, so it's going to be 4.5. 27 plus 4 will get us to 31, so that's going to be equal to 31.5. Or you could multiply it out like this, if you like. But the area of this region is 31.5. And then the area of this triangle right over here is going to be 9 times 3 times 1/2. We're looking at a triangle. 9 times 3 is 27. 27 times 1/2 is 13.5. So to find the area of the entire thing, we just have to sum up these areas. We have 31.5 plus 13.5 plus 12.25 plus 3.5. So we just have a 5 here in the hundredths. That's the only one. 5 plus 5 is 10, plus 7 is 17. 1 plus 1 is 2, plus 3 is 5, plus 2 is 7, plus 3 is 10. 1 plus 3 is 4, plus 1 is 5, plus 1 is 6. So we get a total area for this figure of 60.75 square units.",math_engageny-geo_geo-3
" - What I hope to do in this video is several examples from the Khan Academy exercise on negative number addition and subtraction equivalent expressions. This is just to really make sure that we fully digested how we can compute with negative and positive numbers, and also the properties of arithmetic that we can apply when we compute with them. Let's get started. It says Raul tried to evaluate an expression step by step. All right, they start with the expression, they give us the steps. They say find Raul's mistake. We have Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, or maybe Raul did not make a mistake. Like always, I encourage you to pause the video and try to solve it on your own before I work through it. All right, so let's look at this first step. It says 3 minus negative 5 minus 7. It looks like he correctly recognized that subtracting a negative 5 is the same thing as adding a positive 5. He replaced the minus negative 5 with the plus 5 right over there. That seems right. All right. Step 1 seems all right. Then, what does he do next? He has two options. He could say 3 plus 5 is equal to 8, and then subtract 7 from that, an you would get 1. He could even say 5 minus 7 is negative 2, and then add that to 3, and get 1. It looks like Raul tried to go that second way, but he made a slight mistake. He said 5 minus 7 is equal to 2 not negative 2. 5 minus 7 should be negative 2, but he wrote a positive 2 right over here. His mistake is in Step 2. Then obviously, Step 3 becomes wrong, because Step 2. This is where he first makes the mistake. Let's do several more of these. Which of the following expressions are equivalent to 6 plus negative 4 minus 5. All right, so let's look at all the options here. This first one, let's see, has a negative 5. Well, the negative 5, this minus 5 if you put it out front, you could represent it as a negative 5. Then it has a negative 4 here. Here, we're adding a negative 4, or I guess you could say, we have minus 4 here, which is the same thing as adding a negative 4. That seems reasonable. Then, you have plus 6, and you just had a positive 6 right over here. This one actually seem equivalent. It just the order, they just switched the order. Instead of adding the 6 first, they add the positive 6 last. Instead of having the minus 5 at the end, they put a negative 5 in the beginning. Instead of saying adding negative 4, they just said minus 4. These are all equivalent. This one is going to be an equivalent expression. Now, let's see, this one has ... it has the 6 and the minus 4, they just changed the order. Now, it has positive 5. That's not going to work, because we're subtracting 5 out here. If we want to put the 5 out front, it needs to be a negative 5. This isn't going to be right. I'm not going to select none of the above, because I found a choice that is equivalent. Let's keep going, it's a lot of fun. Which of the following expressions are equivalent to negative 4 plus 4 plus 5 in parenthesis. If I were to compute this, I would say negative 4 plus, and I would add the 4 and the 5 first. I would get 9. It would be negative 4 plus 9 which is equal to 5. Let's see. Zero plus 5, well that's going to be equal to 5. That's equivalent. I mean, I could just do it again. Negative 4 plus 9 is 5, which is the same thing as 9 minus 4. This right here is 5. Now, this is negative 4 minus 4, which would be negative 8. Then, plus 5 would be negative 3. That's not equivalent. In order to be equivalent, this should evaluate out to be 5. I'm not going to select that, and I'm not going to select none of the above, because I all ready found a choice that I like. Let's do a few more of these. One again, which are equivalent? Negative 5 plus 7 minus negative 3. Here you have negative 5 plus 7 plus 3. Well, that make sense. If you subtract a negative 3, that's the same thing as adding a 3. They didn't change the negative 5 plus 7. They didn't change the negative 5 plus 7. I definitely select this one. Definitely select that. Now, let's look at this one. Negative 5, here they're subtracting a 5, so that seems reasonable. Adding 7, they're adding 7. Here, they're subtracting a negative 3, which is the same thing as adding a positive 3. Here, they just have a negative 3 here. If this was a positive 3, then we would be in business. This is a negative 3, so this isn't going to work. I will not select that. I won't select none of the above, because I found a choice. Let's do one more of these. Which of the following expressions are equivalent to X plus Y, and since there's parenthesis around it I would do that first, and then I would subtract Z. Select all that apply. All right. Here, they have Z plus X plus Y. They have the X plus Y part, but then they have a Z here, while over here they have minus Z. If there were a negative Z here, this and this would of been equivalent, but they don't have a negative Z here. I would not select that one. Now, this one you have X plus Y minus Z. Well this, they just changed the parenthesis. Instead of doing the X plus Y first, they're dong the Y minus Z first. This goes back to addition and subtraction. You have the associative property. You could associate these. You could start with adding these two first, and then you do the subtracting, or you could do the subtraction first. Then, you add this one. If you don't believe me, you could try it out with some numbers, and I encourage you to try it out with some negative numbers. It will indeed all work out. All they do is they change where the parenthesis are. They did the Y minus Z first, and then they do the Y minus Z, and then they add it to the X, as opposed to doing the X plus Y first, then subtracting the Z. I would go with that one.",math_in-in-class-6-math-india-icse_in-in-6-addition-and-subtraction-of-negative-numbers-icse
" So I have the series-- negative 5/3 plus 25 over 6 minus 125 over 9 plus-- and it just keeps going on and on and on forever. So this right over here is an infinite sum or an infinite series, and what I want you to do right now is to pause this video and try to express this infinite series using sigma notation. So I'm assuming you've given a go at it, so let's just look at each term of the series and let's see if we can express it with kind of an ever-increasing index. So the first thing that might jump out at you is this oscillating sign that's happening right over here. And whenever we see an oscillating sign, that's a pretty good idea that we could kind of view this as negative 1 to the n-th, where n is our index. So for example, that right over there is negative 1 to the first power. That is-- this right over here is negative 1 to the second power. That right over there is negative 1 to the third power. So it looks like the sign is being defined by raising negative 1 to the index. Now let's look at the other parts of these terms right over here. So we have 5, then we have 25, the we have 125, so these are the powers of 5. So this right over here is 5 to the first power, this right over here is 5 to the second power, this right over here is 5 to the third power. So this part, we're raising 5 to our index. Notice, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3. And then finally, let's look at this. We have 3, 6, and 9. So this literally-- if our index here is 1, this is 3 times 1. If our index here is 2, this is 3 times 2. If our index here is 3, this is 3 times 3. So this is 3 times 1, that is 3 times 2-- let me write it this way-- 3 times 2, that right over there is 3 times 3. So this sets us up pretty well to write this in sigma notation. So let's write it over here just so we can compare. So let me give myself some real estate to work with. So we could write this as the sum-- I'll do it in yellow-- as the sum, so this is our sigma. We can start our index n at 1, from n equals 1, and we're going to keep going on and on forever. We just keep going on and on forever. And so it's negative 1 to the n-th power times 5 to the n-th over-- notice 5 to the n-th-- over 3n is going to be equal to this. And you can verify when n equals 1, it's negative 1 to the nth power-- I'm sorry-- negative 1 to the first power, which is negative 1 times 5 to the first power, which is 5 over 3 times 1. And we can do that for each successive term. And so we're all done.",math_integral-calculus_ic-series
" -  What we're going to do in this video is tackle some word problems involving ratios. So here, we're told that Yoda Soda is the intergalactic party drink that will have all of your friends saying, mm, good this is. You are throwing a party and you need five liters of Yoda Soda for every 12 guests. If you have 36 guests, how many liters of Yoda Soda do you need? So pause this video and try to figure it out on your own. Well, they tell us the ratio of liters of soda to number of guests. So you need five, it's five liters for every 12 guests is the ratio but we wanna have 36 guests. So if the ratio is five liters of soda for every 12 guests but we're in a situation where we have 36 guests, so this is three times as many guests, we're gonna need three times as many liters of soda. So three times five is 15. Five to 12. Five liters for 12 guests or for five liters for every 12 guests is the same thing as 15 liters for every 36 guests. So to answer that question, how many liters do you need, you need 15 liters. Let's do another one of these. Here, we just have a picture of a bunch of fish in a tank and it says there are eight big fish for every blank small fish and then it says there are four big fish for every blank small fish. So pause this video again and see if you can work through this. Alright, so let's just count the big fish first. So there's one, two, three, wait, let me count this way. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. So in this tank, there actually are eight big fish and so let's see how many small fish there are. There's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 small fish. So in the tank, for every eight big fish which you see in red, there are 10 small fish but here it says, there are four big fish for every blank small fish. So what would that be? Well, one way to think about it is we have half as many fish or half as many big fish so we divided it by two. So we're gonna have half as many small fish. So we're gonna divide by two. So for every four big fish, there are five small fish and one way to think about it, you could divide the fish evenly into two groups right over here. So let's see, if we can capture, so if you could have, this is, if I divide it like that, here I have one, two, three, four big fish and one, two, three, four, five small fish then in this group I have one, two, three, four big fish and one, two, three, four, five small fish. So every four big fish, there are five small fish. These are equivalent ratios. Let's keep going. So here, we're told an ice cream shop uses the following ingredients to make one sundae. So they use two scoops of ice cream, four spoonfuls of sprinkles, two tablespoons of whipped cream. How many sundaes did the shop make if they used 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles? So pause the video and try to think about it. So there's a couple of ways to think about it. Here, it says, let's see, we're talking about sprinkles. So that's what's relevant here. Four spoonfuls for every one sundae. So we could say that there, so the ratio of spoonfuls to sundaes is four to one. Four spoonfuls, spoonfuls of sprinkles, let me write it this way, let me write sprinkles, sprinkles. How many spoonfuls? How many spoonfuls for one sundae? But here we're talking about using 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles so that is eight times as many. So you're going to be able to use, create eight times as many sundaes. So you're gonna have 32 spoonfuls of sprinkles for every eight sundaes. So how many sundaes did the shop make? Well, they made eight. Let's do one last example. At a dog park, there are 10 black dogs, five brown dogs, two white dogs and 12 multi-color dogs. For every one brown dog, there are two blank dogs. Pause the video and figure out what goes in this blank. Alright, so let's see. There's five brown dogs for every 10 black dogs, five brown dogs for every two white dogs and five brown dogs for every 12 multi-color dogs but here you're saying for every one brown dog, there are two blank dogs. So what type of dog is there a ratio? So for every brown dog, there's twice as many of that type of dog. Well, here, we see for every five brown dogs, there are 10 black dogs. So one way to think about it, the number of black dogs is always gonna be twice the number of brown dogs. So for every one brown dog, there would be two, two black, two black dogs. One way to think about it, the ratio between brown dogs and black dogs and it's kinda counterintuitive. I used the wrong colors here. I should have used brown and black. So let me do that. So the ratio of brown to black is five brown dogs for every 10, 10 black dogs or if you divide both of these numbers by five, you would get one, one brown dog for every two, for every two black dogs and that's exactly what this statement is saying.",math_in-in-class-6-math-india-icse_in-in-6-ratio-and-proportion-icse
" Alyssa is playing a video game. Her character is on a quest to vanquish an evil sorcerer and his minions from the land. Her character is a wizard whose spells have a range of 6 meters. The locations of objects in the game are stored by the computer in terms of x and y-coordinates. So 5 comma 4 is the location of Alyssa's wizard. 8 comma 7 is the location of Minion A. 2 comma negative 1 is the location of Minion B. 9 comma 0 is the location of Minion C. So what I want to do-- and I want you to pause this video. And I want you to think about, given that her wizard has a range of 6 meters, which of these minions can the wizard actually reach? I'm assuming you're given a go at it. And we just have to remind ourselves, to figure out which of these minions are in reach, we have to say, well, which of these points are within 6 units? We're assuming that these units are in meters right over here. Which of these points are within 6 units of 5 comma 4? And to think about that, we just have to calculate the distance between this point and this point, that point and that point, that point and that point, and see if they are greater than or less than 6 meters. And how do we calculate a distance between two points? Well if this is some point right over here-- that's x1 comma y1. And then this is another point right over here, x2 comma y2. And we want to calculate this distance right over here. The distance formula comes straight out of the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem tells us, if this side right over here is our change in y-- and let's actually just write that as the absolute value of our change in y-- and let's say that this side right over here is the absolute value of our change in x, the Pythagorean theorem tells us that this one, the hypotenuse, is going to be the square root of the sum of the squares of the two sides-- so change in x squared plus change in y squared. You might say, hey, what happened to the absolute value? Well when I square it, it's going to be positive anyway. So I don't have to write down the absolute value. So really I just need to figure out, between each of these two points, what is the change in x? What's the change in y? Square them, add them together, and then take the square root. So for example, if I were to call this P1, if I were to call this P2, maybe we call this P3-- I want to do them in different colors, so you can keep track of what I'm doing. This is P3, and let's say this is P4. So let's first think about the distance between P1 and P2. Well, that's going to be equal to the square root of our change in x squared. So our change in x is 3. That squared is 9, plus our change in y squared. Our change in y is also 3. That squared is 9. So this is going to be square root of 18, which is the same thing as 3 square roots of 2. Now is this more or less than 6? Well 3 times 2 is equal to 6. Square root of 2 is less than 2. It's 1 point something. So this right over here is going to be less than 6. So P2 is in range. Alissa's wizard can get Minion A. Minion A, she can attack. Now think about Minion B. So the distance between P1 and P3 is going to be equal to the square root of-- so your change in x, it's negative 3. Negative 3 squared is positive 9. Our change in y, to go from 4 to negative 1, it's negative 5. That squared is 25-- so 9 plus 25, which is equal to the square root of 34. Now is this greater than or equal to 6? Well, the square root of 36 is 6. So this is the square root of a lower number. So this is going to be less than 6 as well. So Minion B is also in reach. Now let's think about this last point. The distance between P1 and P4 is going to be equal to the square root of our change in x squared-- the change in x is 4, squared is 16-- plus our change in y squared. Our change in y is negative 4. But you square that, and you get another 16. So this is going to be square root of 32, which actually we could just leave it as square root of 32. Square root of 32 is clearly less than the square root of 36, which is 6. So this is also going to be less than 6. So she can get at all of the Minions. They're all within 6 units of her. Now which of these is the furthest away? Well actually, if we were to write this-- we simplified this, but we could write this as the square root of 18. Square root of 18 is clearly the smallest out of square root of 18, square root of 32, and square root of 34. So Minion A is the closest. And Minion B, square root of 34, is the farthest.",math_math1_analytic-geo
" -  We've got the equation Y plus two is equal to negative two, times X minus three. And, what I wanna do is figure out what is the slope of the line that this equation describes? And there's a couple of ways that you can approach it. What my brain wants to do is well, I know a few forms where it's easy to pick out the slope. For example, if I can manipulate that equation to be in the form Y is equal to MX plus B, well then I know that this M here, the coefficient on the X term, well that's going to be my slope. And B is going to be my Y intercept, we cover that in many other videos. Another option is to get into point-slope form. So the general framework or the general template for point-slope form is, if I have an equation of the form Y minus Y1 is equal to M times X minus X1, well then I immediately know that the line that this equation describes is going to have a slope of M once again. And here the Y intercept doesn't jump out at you. Let me make sure you can read this over here. The Y intercept doesn't jump out at you, but you know a point that is on this line. In particular, you know that the point X1, Y1 is going to be on this line. X1, Y1. So let's look at our original example. So it might immediately jump out at you that this is actually in point-slope form. You might say, well okay, I see I have a minus X1, so X1 would be three, I have my slope here and that answers our question, our slope would be negative two. But here it says plus two, I have to subtract a Y1. Well, you could just rewrite this, so it says, so you have Y minus negative two is equal to negative two times X minus three, and then you see it's exactly this point-slope form right over here. So our slope right over there is negative two, and then if I were to ask you, well give me a point that sits on this line, you could say, alright, an X1 would be three, and a Y1 would be negative two. This point sits on the line, it's not the Y intercept, but it's a point on the line and we know the slope is negative two. Now another way to approach this is to just manipulate it so that we get into slope-intercept form. So let's do that, let's manipulate it so we get into slope-intercept form. So the first thing my brain wants to do is distribute this negative two, and if I do that, I get Y plus two is equal to negative 2x, negative two times negative three, plus six. And then I can subtract two from both sides, and then I get Y is equal to negative 2x plus four. And so here I am in slope Y intercept form, and once again, I could say, alright my M here, the coefficient on the X term, is my slope. So my slope is negative two. Let's do another example. So here, this equation doesn't immediately go into either one of these forms, so let's manipulate it. And if it's in either one of them, I like to get into slope Y intercept form, it's a little bit easier for my brain to understand. So let's do that. So let us collect, well let's get the Xs, let's just isolate the Y on the right-hand side, since the 2y is already there. So let's add three to both sides. I'm just trying to get rid of this negative three. So if we add three to both sides, on the left-hand side we have negative 4x plus 10 is equal to 2y, these cancel out. That was the whole point. And now to solve for Y, we just have to divide both sides by two. So if we divide everything by two, we get negative 2x plus five is equal to Y. So this is in slope-intercept form. I just have the Y on the right-hand side instead of the left-hand side. We have Y is equal to mx plus B, and so our M is the coefficient on the X term right over here. So our slope is once again, is negative two, and here our Y intercept is five, in case we wanted to know it. Let's do one more example, one more example. Alright, so once again, this is in neither slope-intercept or point-slope form to begin with, so let's just try to get it to slope-intercept form. And like always, pause the video, and see if you can figure it out yourself. Alright, so let's get all the Ys on the left-hand side isolated, and the Xs on the right-hand side. So let me get rid of this negative 3x. So I'm gonna add 3x to both sides, and let's get rid of this 3y right over here. So let's subtract 3y from both sides. You couldn't do this, I'm doing two steps at once, but once again, I'm trying to get rid of this 3x, so I'm trying to get rid of this negative 3x, so I add 3x to the left, but I have to do it to the right if I want to maintain the equality. And if I want to get rid of this 3y, well I subtract 3y from here, but I have to do it on the left-hand side if I want to maintain the equality. So what do I get? That cancels out, 5y minus 3y is 2y, is equal to 2x plus 3x is 5x, and then these two characters cancel out. And so if I want to solve for Y, I just divide both sides by two and I get Y is equal to five halves X, and I'm done. And you mights say wait, if this doesn't look exactly like slope-intercept form, where is my B? Well your B, if you wanted to see it, you could just write plus zero, B is implicitly zero right over here. So your slope, your slope is going to be the coefficient on the X term, it's going to be five halves. And if you want to know your Y intercept, well it's zero, when X is zero, Y is zero.",math_algebra-home_alg-linear-eq-func
" Jamie wants to know the volume of his gold ring in cubic inches. He gets a rectangular glass with base 3 inches by 2 inches. So you see that here, the base is 3 inches by 2 inches. And he fills the glass 4 inches high with water. So you see that over here, 4 inches high with water. Jamie drops his gold ring in the glass and measures the new height of the water to be 4.25 inches. So this is after the gold ring is dropped. What is the volume of Jamie's ring in cubic inches? Well when you start with this water right over here and you add his ring, whatever that volume is of his ring is going to displace an equal volume of water and push it up. And so the incremental volume that you now have is essentially going to be the volume of his ring. Well what is the incremental volume here? Well it's going to be the volume. If you think about going from this before volume to the after volume, the difference is the base stays the same. It's 3 inches by 2 inches, the difference is-- to make it a little bit neater-- the base is the same. The difference is the height. The height now is 4.25 inches after dropping in the ring So the water went up by 0.25 inches. Let me write that, 0.25 inches is what the water went up by. So we could just think about, what is this incremental volume going to be? So this incremental volume right over here, that I'm shading in with purple. Well to figure that out we just have to measure. We just have to multiply the length times the width times the height times 0.25. So it's just going to be 3 times 2 times 0.25. 3 times 2 is 6, times 0.25, and you could do that either on paper or you might be able do that in your head. 4 times 0.25 is going to be 1, and you have 2 more times 0.25, that's going to be 0.5. So this is going to be 1.50. And we multiply it inches times inches times inches. So this is going to be in terms of cubic inches. 1.5 cubic inches is the volume of Jamie's ring, which is actually a pretty sizable volume for a gold ring. Maybe he has a very big finger or he just likes to spend, or I guess is his, whoever bought him the ring likes to spend a lot on gold.",math_cc-seventh-grade-math_cc-7th-geometry
" -  What is the area of the figure? So down here we have this one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10-sided figure, and we want to know its area, how many square meters does this figure cover? And we have some measurements, that seems helpful, but what's not too helpful to me is I don't know the special trick to find the area of a 10-sided figure so I've got to think about what I do know and what I do know is the way to find area of a rectangle. So what I can do, because I can see, if I can find any rectangles in here. Here's one rectangle, right there. So I can find the area of that part. Then let's see if I can find any more. Here's another rectangle. So I can find the area of that part. We could call that one a rectangle or a square. And then that leaves us with this last part, which is again, a rectangle. So what we did is, we broke this up or decomposed it into three rectangles and now if I find out how much space this purple one covers, and the blue one and the green one, if I combine those, that would tell me the area of the entire figure, how much space the entire figure covers. So let's start with this one right here. This one is three meters long, so we can kind of divide that by three meters, into three equal meters, and then we've got a width of two meters down here so we can split that in half. So if we draw those lines out, we can see this top row is going to cover one square meter, two square meters, three square meters, and then there's two rows of that, so there's two rows of three square meters for a total of six square meters. This rectangle covers six square meters, so this part of the entire figure covers six square meters. The next one, our measurements are three and a three, so it will have three rows of three square meters or nine square meters, and then finally this purple one has three meters and nine, so we can say it will have three rows of nine or nine rows of three square meters which is 27 square meters. So the area of this purple section, it covers completely 27 square meters. The green covers nine square meters, and the blue covered six square meters. So, if we combine all those areas, all those square meters it covers, that will tell us the area of the entire figure. So we have six square meters, plus nine square meters, plus 27, and we can solve that, six plus nine is 15, 15 plus 27, let's see, five ones and seven ones is 12 ones. We'll just find some space up there. And one 10 and two 10's or a 10 and a 20 is 30. And 30 plus 12 is 42. So the area of the entire figure is 42 square meters.",math_in-in-class-6-math-india-icse_in-in-6-perimeter-and-area-icse
" Solve this system. And once again, we have three equations with three unknowns. So this is essentially trying to figure out where three different planes would intersect in three dimensions. And to do this, if we want to do it by elimination, if we want to be able to eliminate variables, it looks like, well, it looks like we have a negative z here. We have a plus 2z. We have a 5z over here. If we were to scale up this third equation by positive 2, then you would have a negative 2z here, and it would cancel out with this 2z there. And then if you were to scale it up by 5, you'd have a negative 5z here, and then that could cancel out with that 5z over there. So let's try to cancel out. Let's try to eliminate the z's first. So let me start with this equation up here. I'll just rewrite it. So we have-- I'll draw an arrow over here-- we have x plus 2y plus 5z is equal to negative 17. And then to cancel out or to eliminate the z's, I'll multiply this equation here times 5. So I'm going to multiply this equation times 5. So we have to multiply both sides by 5. So 3x times 5 is 15x, y times 5 is plus 5y, and then negative z times 5 is negative 5z-- that's the whole point and why we're multiplying it by 5-- is equal to 3 times 5, which is equal to 15. And so if we add these two equations, we get x plus 15x is 16x, 2y plus 5y is 7y, and 5z minus 5z or plus negative 5z, those are going to cancel out. And that is going to be equal to negative 17 plus 15 is negative 2. So we were able to use the constraints in that equation and that equation, and now we have an equation in just x and y. So let's try to do the same thing. Let's trying to eliminate the z's. But now I'll use this equation and this equation. So this equation-- let me just rewrite it over here. We have 2x minus 3y plus 2z is equal to negative 16. I just rewrote it. And now, so that this 2z gets eliminated, let's multiply this equation times 2. So let's multiply it times 2, so we'll have a negative 2z here to eliminate with the positive 2z. So 2 times 3x is 6x, 2 times y is plus 2y, and then 2 times negative z is negative 2z is equal to 2 times 3 is equal to 6. And now we can add these two equations. 2x plus 6x is 8x, negative 3y plus 2y is negative y, and then these two guys get canceled out. And then that is equal to negative 16 plus 6 is negative 10. So now we have two equations with two unknowns. We've eliminated the z's. And let's see, if we want to eliminate again, we have a negative y over here. We have a positive 7y. Well, we could eliminate the y's if we multiplied this times 7 and add the two equations. So let's do that. So let's multiply this times 7. 7 times 8 is 56, so it's 56x minus 7y is equal to 7 times negative 10, is equal to negative 70. And now we can add these two equations. I'm now trying to eliminate the y's. So we have 16x plus 56x. That is 72x. So we have 72x, these guys eliminate, equal to negative 72, negative 2 plus negative 70. Divide both sides by 72, and we get x is equal to negative 1. And now we just have to substitute back to figure out what y and z are equal to. So let's go back to this equation right over here. So we have 8x minus y is equal to negative 10. If x is equal to negative 1, that means 8 times negative 1, or negative 8 minus y is equal to negative 10. We can add 8 to both sides. And so we have negative y is equal to negative 2, or multiplying both sides by negative 1, y is equal to 2. let me square that off. So x is equal to negative 1, y is equal to 2. We now just have to worry about z, and we can go back to any of these up here. So I'll just use this last one. The numbers seem lower. So if we substitute back into this last equation right over here, we have 3 times x, which is 3 times negative 1 plus y, which is 2, minus z is equal to 3. So it's negative 3 plus 2 minus z is equal to 3. And this is negative 1 minus z is equal to 3. And then add 1 to both sides, we get-- these cancel out-- negative z is equal to 4. Multiplying both sides by negative 1, you get z is equal to negative 4. So we're done. Let's verify that these solutions, or the solution of x is negative 1, y is equal to 2, z is equal to negative 4, actually satisfies all three of these constraints. So let's substitute into this first one. So you have x plus 2y plus 5z. So x is negative 1 plus 2 times y, so plus 4, plus 5z. So minus 20 has to be equal to negative 17. And this is negative. This right here is positive 3 minus 20 is indeed equal to negative 17. So it satisfies the first constraint. Let's look at the second one. 2 times x, 2 times negative 1. That's negative 2 minus 3 times y. That's minus 6-- 3 times 2 is 6-- plus 2 times z. z is negative 4, so that's 2 times negative 4 is negative 8. That needs to equal negative 16. Negative 2 minus negative 8 is-- sorry, negative 2 minus negative 6 is negative 8. Subtract another 8, you get negative 16. So it meets the second constraint. And then, finally, let's look at the last constraint. We have 3 times x, so negative 3 plus y, so plus 2, minus z. So minus negative 4 is the same thing as plus 4. That needs to be equal to 3. So negative 3 plus 2 is negative 1 plus 4 is indeed equal to 3. So we found the point of intersection in three dimensions of these three planes. x is negative 1, z is negative 4, y is 2. And we were able to verify that it does indeed meet all of the constraints.",math_algebra-home_alg-system-of-equations
" [MUSIC PLAYING THROUGHOUT] What does ""specific gravity"" mean? The specific gravity of an object is the density of that object divided by the density of water. The density of water is 1,000 kilograms per meter cubed. For instance, the density of gold is 19,300 kilograms per meter cubed. So the specific gravity of gold is 19.3. The density of ketchup is 1,400 kilograms per meter cubed. So the specific gravity of ketchup up is 1.4. Note, there's no units for specific gravity, because it's the ratio of one density to another density. So the units cancel each other out. OK, so why even bother defining something called the specific gravity? Well, one really cool thing about specific gravity is that, for something that floats, the specific gravity tells you the fraction of that object that will be below the water while it's floating. For instance, say you let a cube of wood with specific gravity 0.2 float in water. Since the specific gravity is 0.2, that means that 20% of the total volume of this wood is going to be submerged below the water while it's floating. If the cube of wood had a specific gravity of 0.6, 60% of the wood would be submerged beneath the water's surface. Ice has a density of about 920 kilograms per meter cubed. That means ice has a specific gravity of 0.92. And that's why 92% of an iceberg's volume is actually underneath the water. But what if we were to use a cube that had a density of 2,700 kilograms per meter cubed? The specific gravity would be 2.7, which means that 270% of this cube would be submerged beneath the water. But you can't have more than 100% of an object submerged. Even if the object were to sink, the maximum amount submerged would be 100%. So if the specific gravity of an object is greater than 1, that object is going to sink if placed freely in water. And it'll have exactly 100% of its volume submerged. Usually when people are referring to the specific gravity, they're referring to the density of the object divided by the density of water. But sometimes it's useful to define the specific gravity with respect to a liquid that's different from water. For instance, if you were to let some wood of density 638 kilograms per meter cubed float in oil that has a density of 850 kilograms per meter cubed, you could still find the percent of the wood that's submerged underneath the oil. Just use the density of oil instead of the density of water in the specific gravity formula. If we do that, we'll find that the wood does float in this oil with 75% of the wood's volume submerged beneath the surface of the oil.

" You've opened up a shoe factory and you're trying to figure out how many thousands of pairs of shoes to produce in order to optimize your profit. And so let's let x equal the thousands of pairs produced. Now let's think about how much money you're going to make per pair. Actually, let me say how much revenue, which is how much you actually get to sell those shoes for. So let's write a function right here. Revenue as a function of x. Well, you have a wholesaler who's willing to pay you $10 per pair for as many pairs as you're willing to give him. So your revenue as a function of x is going to be 10 times x. And since x is in thousands of pairs produced, if x is 1, that means 1,000 pairs produced times 10, which means $10,000. But this will just give you 10. So this right over here is in thousands of dollars. So if x is 1, that means 1,000 pairs produced. 10 times 1 says r is equal to 10, but that really means $10,000. Now, it would be a nice business if all you had was revenue and no costs. But you do have costs. You have materials, you have to build your factory, have to pay your employees, you have to pay the electricity bill. And so you hire a bunch of consultants to come up with what your cost is as a function of x. And they come up with a function. They say it is the number of the thousands of pairs you produce cubed minus 6 times the thousands of pairs you produce squared plus 15 times the thousands of pairs that you produce. And once again, this is also going to be in thousands of dollars. Now, given these functions of x for revenue and cost, what is profit as a function of x going to be? Well, your profit as a function of x is just going to be equal to your revenue as a function of x minus your cost as a function of x. If you produce a certain amount and let's say you bring in, I don't know, $10,000 of revenue and it costs you $5,000 to produce those shoes, you'll have $5,000 in profit. Those numbers aren't the ones that would actually you would get from this right here. I'm just giving you an example. So this is what you want to optimize. You want to optimize p as a function of x. So what is it? I've just said it here in abstract terms, but we know what r of x is and what's c of x. This is 10x minus all of this business. So minus x to the third plus 6x squared minus 15x. I just subtracted x squared, you subtract 6x squared it becomes positive, you subtract a 15x it becomes negative 15x, and then we can simplify this as-- let's see, we have negative x to the third plus 6x squared minus 15x plus 10x, so that is minus 5x. Now if we want to optimize this profit function analytically, the easiest way is to think about what are the critical points of this profit function and are any of those critical points minimum points or maximum points? And if one of them is a maximum point, then we can say, well, let's produce that many. That is going to be-- we will have optimized or we will figure out the quantity we need to produce in order to optimize our profit. So to figure out critical points, we essentially have to find the derivative of our function and figure out when does that derivative equal 0 or when is that derivative undefined? That's the definition of critical points. So p prime of x is going to be equal to negative 3x squared plus 12x minus 5. And so this thing is going to be defined for all x. So the only critical points we're going to have is when the first derivative right over here is equal to 0. So negative 3x squared plus 12x minus 5 needs to be equal to 0 in order for x to be a critical point. So now we just have to solve for x. And so we just are essentially solving a quadratic equation. Just so that I don't have as many negatives, let's multiply both sides by negative 1. I just like to have a clean first coefficient. So if we multiply both sides by negative 1, we get 3x squared minus 12x plus 5 is equal to 0. And now we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x. So x is going to be equal to negative b, which is 12, plus or minus the square root. I always need to make my radical signs wide enough. The square root of b squared, which is 144, minus 4 times a, which is 3, times c, which is 5. All of that over 2a. So 2 times 3 is 6. So x is equal to 12 plus or minus the square root of, let's see, 4 times 3 is 12 times 5 is 60. 144 minus 60 is 84. All of that over 6. So x could be equal to 12 plus the square root of 84 over 6 or x could be equal to 12 minus the square root of 84 over 6. So let's figure out what these two are. And I'll use a calculator. I'll use the calculator for this one. So I get, let's see, 12 plus the square root of 84 divided by 6 gives me 3.5-- I'll just say 3.53. So approximately 3.-- Actually, let me go one more digit, because I'm talking about thousands. So let me say 3.528. So this would literally be 3,528 shoes, because this is in thousands, or pairs of shoes. And then let's do the situation where we subtract. And actually we can look at our previous entry and just change this to a subtraction. Change that to not a negative sign, a subtraction. There you go. And we get 0.4725. Let me remember that. 0.4725. Approximately equal to 0.4725. I have a horrible memory, so let me review that I wrote the same thing. 4725. Yep. All right. Now these are all we know about these, or these are both critical points. These are points at which our derivative is equal to 0. But we don't know whether they're minimum points, they're points at which the function takes on a minimum value, a maximum value, or neither. To do that, I'll use the second derivative test to figure out if our function is concave upwards or concave downwards or neither at one of these points. So let's look at the second derivative. So p prime prime of x is going to be equal to negative 6x plus 12. And so if we look at-- let me make sure I have enough space. So if we look at p prime prime of 3.528. So let's see if I can think this through. So this is between 3 and 4. So if we take the lower value, 3 times negative 6 is negative 18 plus 12 is going to be less than 0. And if this was 4 it'd be even more negative, so this thing is going to be less than 0. Don't even have to use my calculator to evaluate it. Now what about this thing right over here? 0.47. Well, 0.47, that's roughly 0.5. So negative 6 times 0.5 is negative 3. This is going to be nowhere close to being negative. This is definitely going to be positive. So p prime prime of 0.4725 is greater than 0. So the fact that the second derivative is less than 0, that means that my derivative is decreasing. My first derivative is decreasing when x is equal to this value, which means that our graph, our function, is concave downwards here. And concave downwards means it looks something like this. And so you can see what it looks something like that, the slope is constantly decreasing. So if you have an interval where the slope is decreasing and you know the point where the slope is exactly 0, which is where x is equal to 3.528, it must be a maximum. So we actually do take on a maximum value when x is 3.528. On the other side we see that over here we're concave upwards. The graph will look something like this over here. And if the slope is 0 where the graph looks like that, we see that that is a local minimum. And so we definitely don't want to do this. We would produce 472 and 1/2 units if we were looking to minimize our profit, maximize our loss. So we definitely don't want to do this. But let's actually think about what our profit is going to be if we produce 3.528 thousands of shoes, or 3,528 shoes. Well, to do that we just have to input it back into our original profit function right over here. 1So let's do that. 1So I get my calculator out. 1So my original profit function is right over there. 1So I want to be able to see that and that. 1So I get negative 3.528 to the third power plus 6 times 3.528 1squared minus 5 times 3.528 gives me-- 1and we get a drum roll now-- gives me a profit of 13.128. 1So let me write this down. 1The profit when I produce 3,528 shoes is approximately equal to 1or it is equal to, if I produce exactly that many shoes, 1it's equal to 13.128. 1Or actually it's approximately, because I'm still 1rounding 13.128. 1So if I produce 3,528 shoes in a given period, 1I'm going to have a profit of $13,128. 1Remember, this right over here is in thousands, 1this right over here is 13.128 thousands 1of dollars in profit, which is $13,128. 1Anyway, we are now going to be rich shoe manufacturers.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-applications-derivatives
" As a birthday gift, Zoey gave her niece an electronic piggy bank that displays the total amount of money in the bank as well as the total number of coins. After depositing some number of nickels and quarters only-- so we only have nickels and quarters-- the display read money $2.00, number of coins 16 How many nickels and quarters did Zoey put in the bank? So let's define some variables here. Let's let n equal the number of nickels. Maybe I'll write ""let"" here. Let's let q be equal to the number of quarters. So how many total coins do we have? We'', it's going to be the number of nickels plus the number of quarters. So we have the nickels plus the quarters need to be equal to-- well, it tells us we have 16 total coins. So if we add up the total number of nickels plus the number of quarters, we have 16 coins. So that's one equation right there. And then how much total money do we have? Well, however many nickels we have, we can multiply that times 0.05, and that'll tell us how much money we have in nickels. So 0.05 times the nickels plus the amount of money we have in quarters. Well, that'll just be $0.25 per quarter, or 0.25 of $1. So let me write 0.25 times the number of quarters. For example, if I had 4 quarters and no nickels, I'd have 4 times $0.25 which is $1. And no money due to nickels. So it's however may nickels times $0.05 plus however many quarters times $0.25. That's the total amount of money I have. And her piggy bank tells me that is $2.00. That is equal to $2.00. So we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for n and q. And let's do it by substitution. So the easiest thing that we could do here, let's solve for q over here. So if n plus q is equal to 16, we could subtract n from both sides of this equation. So if n plus q is equal to 16, if we subtract n from both sides, we get q is equal to 16 minus n. So all I did is I rewrote this first constraint right over there. So since this first constraint is telling us that q, the number of quarters, must be 16 minus the number of nickels, in the second constraint, every place that we see a q, every place we see quarters, we can replace it with 16 minus n. So let's do that. So the second constraint when we make the substitution becomes 0.05n plus 0.25. Instead of q, I'm going to write 16 minus n. That's what the first constraint tells us. q must be 16 minus n. That is going to be equal to $2.00. We're solving this system by substitution. Now let's see if I can simplify this. So we have 0.05n plus-- let's distribute the 0.25 times the 16 and the 0.25 times the negative n. 0.25 times 16, that's the same thing as 1/4 times 16. That's just going to be 4. And then 0.25 times negative n is minus 0.25n. And that is going to be equal to $2.00. Let me scroll down a little bit. I'll scroll down a little bit. See we have 0.05n minus 0.25n. So if I have 0.05 minus 0.25, let me combine these terms. So if I have 0.05 of something, and I'm going to subtract from that 0.25 of that something, that'll give me negative 0.20 of that something. If I combine these two terms, I get negative 0.20 or negative 0.2n. And then of course, I have the plus 4. Plus 4 is equal to $2.00, or we could even just write 2 there. Now, we can isolate the n on the left-hand side by subtracting 4 from both sides. So let's subtract 4 from both sides. And we are left with, on the left-hand side, negative-- I could just write that is negative 0.20n is equal to 2 minus 4 is negative 2. And then we could divide both sides by negative 0.2. Or I could write negative 0.20, the same thing. We're not going to go too deep into the significance in all that. We're assuming that we have infinite precision on everything. So negative 2 divided by negative 0.2, these guys cancel out, and we are left with n is equal to-- the negatives cancel out. 2 divided by 0.2 is just going to be 10. n is equal to 10. And then we know that q is equal to 16 minus n from the first constraint. q is equal to 16 minus n, which is 10, which is going to be 6. So Zoey put in 10 nickels. I want to do that in a different color. She put in 10 nickels and 6 quarters in the bank. And we can verify it. So clearly she has 16 coins. So that part makes sense. 10 nickels, 6 quarters, that's 16 coins. That makes sense. And we could also verify that it's the right amount of money. 10 nickels are going to be $0.50, 10 times $0.05 each. So it's going to be $0.50. And then 6 quarters is going to be $1.50. So it's going to be $1.50. So the total amount of money she has is $0.50 plus $1.50 which is $2.00. So it all works out.",math_algebra_systems-of-equations
" -  Julia's revenue is r of t thousand dollars per month, where t is the month of the year. Julia had made $3,000 in the first month of the year, what does three plus the definite role from one to five of r of t dt equals 19 mean? And we have some choices. So like always, pause the video and see if you can work through it. Alright, now let's work through this together. So they tell us that she made $3,000 in the first month and we also see this three here, so that's interesting. Maybe they represent the same thing, we don't know for sure yet. But let's look at this definite integral. The definite integral from one to five of r of t dt, this is the area under this rate curve, r of t is the rate atwhich Julia makes revenue on a monthly basis. So if you take the area under that rate curve, that's going to give you the net change in revenue from month one to month five, how much that increased. And so if you add that to the amount she made in month one, well that tells you the total she makes from essentially time zero all the way to month five. And they're saying that is equal to 19. So let's see which of these choices are consistent with that. Julia made an additional $19,000 between months one and five. Choice A would be correct if you didn't see this three over here. Because just the definite integral is the additional between months one and five, but that's not what this expression says, it says three plus this is equal to 19. If it said Julia made an additional $16,000, well that would make sense because you could subtract three from both sides and you'd get that result, but that's not what they're saying. Julia made an average of $19,000 per month. Well once again, that's also not right because we just said from the beginning, from time zero, all the way until the fifth month, she made a total of $19,000. Not the average per month is $19,000. Julia made $19,000 in the fifth month. Once again, this is not just saying what happened in the fifth month. This is saying, we have the $3,000 from the first month and then we have the additional from month between month one and month five, so that's not that. So this better be our choice. By the end of the fifth month, Julia had made a total of $19,000. Yes that is correct. She made $3,000 in month one and then as we go between month one to the end of month five, to the end of the fifth month, she has made a total of $19,000. Let's do another one of these. So here we're told the function k of t gives the amount of ketchup in kilograms produced in a sauce factory by time in hours on a given day. So this is really quantity is a function of time, it isn't rate, what does the definite integral from zero to four of k prime of t dt represent? Once again, pause the video and see if you can work through it. Well k of t is the amount of ketchup as function of time. So k prime of t, that's going to be the rate at which our amount of ketchup is changing a function of time. But once again, when you're taking the area under the rate curve, that tells you the net change in the original quantity in the amount of ketchup. And as the net change between time zero and time four, so let's see which of these choices match up to that. The average rate of change of the ketchup production over the first four hours. No, that does not tell us the average rate of change, there's other ways to calculate that the time it takes to produce four kilograms of ketchup, so does this represent the time it takes? To represent four kilograms of ketchup. No, this four is a time right over here. This is gonna tell you how much ketchup gets produced from time zero to time four. The instantaneous rate of production at t equals four. Now this would be k prime of four, that's not what this integral represents. The amount of ketchup produced over the first four hours, yep that is exactly right.",math_calculus-1_cs1-applications-of-integrals
" Let's say that I have a 100 meter long wire. So that is my wire right over there. And it is 100 meters. And I'm going to make a cut someplace on this wire. And so let's say I make the cut right over there. With the left section of wire-- I'm going to obviously cut it in two-- with the left section, I'm going to construct an equilateral triangle. And with the right section, I'm going to construct a square. And my question for you and for me is, where do we make this cut in order to minimize the combined areas of this triangle and this square? Well, let's figure out. Let's define a variable that we're trying to minimize, or that we're trying to optimize with respect to. So let's say that the variable x is the number of meters that we decide to cut from the left. So if we did that, then this length for the triangle would be x meters, and the length for the square would be, well, if we use x up for the left hand side, we're going to have 100 minus x for the right hand side. And so what would the dimensions of the triangle and the square be? Well, the triangle sides are going to be x over 3, x over 3, and x over 3 as an equilateral triangle. And the square is going to be 100 minus x over 4 by 100 minus x over 4. Now it's easy to figure out an expression for the area of the square in terms of x. But let's think about what the area of an equilateral triangle might be as a function of the length of its sides. So let me do a little bit of an aside right over here. So let's say we have an equilateral triangle. Just like that. And its sides are length s, s, and s. Now we know that the area of a triangle is 1/2 times the base times the height. So in this case, the height we could consider to be altitude, if we were to drop an altitude just like this. This length right over here, this is the height. And this would be perpendicular, just like that. So our area is going to be equal to one half times our base is s. 1/2 times s times whatever our height is, times our height. Now how can we express h as a function of s? Well, to do that we just have to remind ourselves that what we've drawn over here is a right triangle. It's the left half of this equilateral triangle. And we know what this bottom side of this right triangle is. This altitude splits this side exactly into two. So this right over here has length s over 2. So to figure out what h is, we could just use the Pythagorean theorem. We would have h squared plus s over 2 squared plus s over 2 squared is going to be equal to the hypotenuse squared, is going to be equal to s squared. So you would get h squared plus s squared over 4 is equal to s squared. Subtract s squared over 4 from both sides, and you get h squared is equal s squared minus s squared over 4. Now, to do this I could call it s squared. I could call this 4s squared over 4, just to be able to have a common denominator. And 4s squared minus s squared over 4 is going to be equal to 3s squared over 4. So we get h squared is equal to 3s squared over 4. Now we can take the principal root of both sides, and we get h is equal to the square root of 3 times s over 2. So now we can just substitute back right over here and we get our area. Our area is equal to 1/2 s times h. Well h is this business. So it's s times this. So it's 1/2 times s times the square root of 3s over 2, which is going to be equal to s times s is s squared. So this is going to be square root of 3 s squared over 2 times 2 over 4. So this is the area of an equilateral triangle as the function of the length of its sides. So what's the area of this business going to be? So the area of our little equilateral triangle-- let me write a combined area. And let me do that in a neutral color. So let me do that in white. So the combined area, I'll write it A sub c is going to be equal to the area of my triangle A sub t plus the area of my square. Well, the area of my triangle, we know what it's going to be. It's going to be square root of 3 times the length of a side squared divided by 4. So it's going to be square root of 3. Let me do that in that same yellow color. It's going to be-- make sure I switch colors. It's going to be square root of 3 over 4 times a side squared, times x over 3 squared. All I did is the length of a side is x over 3. We already know what the area is. It's the square root of 3 over 4 times the length of a side squared. And then the area of this square right over here, the area of the square is just going to be 100 minus x over 4 squared. So our area, our combined area-- and maybe I can write it like this-- our combined area as a function of where we make the cut is all of this business right over here. And this is what we need to minimize. So we need to minimize that right over there. And I will do that in the next video.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-applications-derivatives
" If you were paying close attention in the last video, an interesting question might have popped up in your brain. We have talked about the intervals over which the function is concave downwards. And then we talked about the interval over which the function is concave upwards. But we see here that there's a point at which we transition from being concave downwards to concave upwards. Before that point, the slope was decreasing, and then the slope starts increasing. The slope was decreasing and then the slope started increasing. So that's one way to look at it. Right here in our function we go from being concave downwards to concave upwards. When you look at our derivative at that point, our derivative went from decreasing to increasing. And when you look at our second derivative at that point, it went from being negative to positive. So this must have some type of a special name you're probably thinking. And you'd be thinking correctly. This point at which we transition from being concave downwards to concave upwards, or the point at which our derivative has a extrema point, or the point at which our second derivative switches signs like this, we call it an inflection point. And the most typical way that people think about how could you test for an inflection point, it's a point, well, conceptually, it's where you go from being a downward opening u to an upward opening u. Or when you go from being concave downwards to concave upwards. But the easiest test is it's a point at which your second derivative switches signs. So in this case, we went from negative to positive. But we could have also switched from being positive to negative. So inflection point, your second derivative f prime prime of x switches signs. Goes from being positive to negative or negative to positive. Switches signs. So this is a case where we went from concave downwards to concave upwards. If we went from concave upwards to concave downwards, like that, then this inflection point up until that point, the slope was increasing. So the second derivative would to be positive. And then the slope is decreasing, so your second derivative would be negative. So here your second derivative is going from positive to negative. Here your second derivative is going from negative to positive. In either case, you are talking about an inflection point.",math_ap-calculus-ab_ab-diff-analytical-applications-new
" -  Sometimes in life, like say, on an exam, in particular, like an AP exam, you might be asked to describe or compare a distribution. And so we're gonna get an example of doing that right over here. Sometimes in life, say on an exam, especially on something like an AP exam, you're asked to describe or compare a distribution. And what we're gonna do in this video is do exactly that, in fact, this one we're gonna describe and in a future video we're going to compare distributions. Now before we even read about this distribution or look at this distribution, if you're asked to describe a distribution, there's four things that you should be thinking about. You should be thinking about the shape of the distribution. And when we're talking about shape, there could be left-skew, there could be right-skew, and we'll see examples of these. And we've talked about them in detail in other videos. It could be symmetric, these are the ones that we typically see, although there might be other types of shapes, you'll have your center of distribution. And there's multiple ways to be thinking about the center of distribution, we've talked about this before, you have your mean, you have your median, these are the two most typical ones. You have a notion of spread. And for spread you could use range, you could use interquartile range, you could use something like a mean absolute deviation, you could use the standard deviation, these are all measures of spread. And then, you probably should at least comment about outliers, even if you don't see them, it's a good idea to comment just to make sure that you are being relatively comprehensive. So now, given that, let's describe the distribution right over here. It says in the state of Connecticut, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the DMV, requires 16 and 17 year olds to take a 25 question knowledge test in order to obtain a Learner's Permit. To pass, prospective drivers must correctly answer at least 20 questions. On one Monday, 22 teenagers took the test. The dot plot below shows their scores. So why don't you pause this video and see if you can take a shot at describing the shape, the center, the spread and the outliers. Some of these you might be able to come with the actual numbers, you might be able to calculate some of these, but really just to get a sense of it, why don't you take a shot at it. Alright, now let's do this together. So first, on the shape. So what we see is, we have, in most of the distribution is in this part between 20 and 25, but then we have this fairly long tail to the left and so this tells us that we have a left-skew or it is a left-skewed distribution right over here. So we have done the shape, it's a left-skewed distribution because the tail goes to the left. Now what about the center of this distribution? So there's a few ways to measure center, mean or median, just for the sake of simplicity, I'll think about the median here, I can eyeball that to some degree. You could also calculate the mean, it would take a little bit more time. I would guess that it's someplace, not even calculating it, I would guess that it's someplace in this range right over there but let me actually calculate it. So the median, there's 22 data points, so the median is whatever number has 11 onto the right of it and 11 to the left, half of 22. So let's see, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. So the median here, is going to be, let's see, this is 23. Because we have a bunch of 23s, one, two, three, four, five, six 23s and if we were to just order all of the data points 11 of the data points would be 23 or less and 11 would be 23 or more. So our median here, so I could say our center, is 23, if we use the median. And actually, let me write that down. So our median is 23, that's the measure of center that I decided to use. Now, what about spread? Well the simplest measure of spread is just the range which is just the highest value minus the lowest value. And so our range here would be 25 minus four. 25 minus four is equal to 21, so that is a measure of range. You could have others but this one is very easy to calculate and then if we think about outliers, well there are a few outliers I would consider and it's very subjective. People can debate, you know if there's a dot right over there, is that an outlier or not. But I would say that these four right over here, I would consider outliers. So I would say approximately four outliers, but once again this is subjective. The main point of this exercise is to just get in the habit of thinking about these things. And statistics is all about creating engineering, one could say, different measurements for center, for spread. Different ways to describe the shape, but the point is is to just think about these various dimensions.",math_ap-statistics_quantitative-data-ap
" In the previous video we were able to apply the binomial theorem in order to figure out what a plus b to fourth power is in order to expand this out. And we did it. And it was a little bit tedious but hopefully you appreciated it. It would have been useful if we did even a higher power-- a plus b to the seventh power, a plus b to the eighth power. But what I want to do in this video is show you that there's another way of thinking about it and this would be using ""Pascal's Triangle"". And if we have time we'll also think about why these two ideas are so closely related. So instead of doing a plus b to the fourth using this traditional binomial theorem-- I guess you could say-- formula right over here, I'm going to calculate it using Pascal's triangle and some of the patterns that we know about the expansion. So once again let me write down what we're trying to calculate. We're trying to calculate a plus b to the fourth power-- I'll just do this in a different color-- to the fourth power. So what I'm going to do is set up Pascal's triangle. So Pascal's triangle-- so we'll start with a one at the top. And one way to think about it is, it's a triangle where if you start it up here, at each level you're really counting the different ways that you can get to the different nodes. So one-- and so I'm going to set up a triangle. So if I start here there's only one way I can get here and there's only one way that I could get there. But now this third level-- if I were to say how many ways can I get here-- well, one way to get here, one way to get here. So there's two ways to get here. One way to get there, one way to get there. The only way I get there is like that, the only way I can get there is like that. But the way I could get here, I could go like this, or I could go like this. And then we could add a fourth level where-- let's see, if I have-- there's only one way to go there but there's three ways to go here. One plus two. How are there three ways? You could go like this, you could go like this, or you could go like that. Same exact logic: there's three ways to get to this point. And then there's only one way to get to that point right over there. And so let's add a fifth level because this was actually what we care about when we think about something to the fourth power. This is essentially zeroth power-- binomial to zeroth power, first power, second power, third power. So let's go to the fourth power. So how many ways are there to get here? Well I just have to go all the way straight down along this left side to get here, so there's only one way. There's four ways to get here. I could go like that, I could go like that, I could go like that, and I can go like that. There's six ways to go here. Three ways to get to this place, three ways to get to this place. So six ways to get to that and, if you have the time, you could figure that out. There's three plus one-- four ways to get here. And then there's one way to get there. And now I'm claiming that these are the coefficients when I'm taking something to the-- if I'm taking something to the zeroth power. This is if I'm taking a binomial to the first power, to the second power. Obviously a binomial to the first power, the coefficients on a and b are just one and one. But when you square it, it would be a squared plus two ab plus b squared. If you take the third power, these are the coefficients-- third power. And to the fourth power, these are the coefficients. So let's write them down. The coefficients, I'm claiming, are going to be one, four, six, four, and one. And how do I know what the powers of a and b are going to be? Well I start a, I start this first term, at the highest power: a to the fourth. And then I go down from there. a to the fourth, a to the third, a squared, a to the first, and I guess I could write a to the zero which of course is just one. And then for the second term I start at the lowest power, at zero. And then b to first, b squared, b to the third power, and then b to the fourth, and then I just add those terms together. And there you have it. I have just figured out the expansion of a plus b to the fourth power. It's exactly what I just wrote down. This term right over here, a to the fourth, that's what this term is. One a to the fourth b to the zero: that's just a to the fourth. This term right over here is equivalent to this term right over there. And so I guess you see that this gave me an equivalent result. Now an interesting question is 'why did this work?' And I encourage you to pause this video and think about it on your own. Well, to realize why it works let's just go to these first levels right over here. If I just were to take a plus b to the second power. a plus b to the second power. This is going to be, we've already seen it, this is going to be a plus b times a plus b so let me just write that down: a plus b times a plus b. So we have an a, an a. We have a b, and a b. We're going to add these together. And then when you multiply it, you have-- so this is going to be equal to a times a. You get a squared. And that's the only way. That's the only way to get an a squared term. There's only one way of getting an a squared term. Then you're going to have plus a times b. So-- plus a times b. And then you're going to have plus this b times that a so that's going to be another a times b. Plus b times b which is b squared. Now this is interesting right over here. How many ways can you get an a squared term? Well there's only one way. You're multiplying this a times that a. There's one way of getting there. Now how many ways are there of getting the b squared term? How many ways are there of getting the b squared term? Well there's only one way. Multiply this b times this b. There's only one way of getting that. But how many ways are there of getting the ab term? The a to the first b to the first term. Well there's two ways. You can multiply this a times that b, or this b times that a. There are-- just hit the point home-- there are two ways, two ways of getting an ab term. And so, when you take the sum of these two you are left with a squared plus two times ab plus b squared. Notice the exact same coefficients: one two one, one two one. Why is that like that? Well there is only one way to get an a squared, there's two ways to get an ab, and there's only one way to get a b squared. If you set it to the third power you'd say okay, there's only one way to get to a to the third power. You just multiply the first a's all together. And there is only one way to get to b to the third power. But there's three ways to get to a squared b. And you could multiply it out, and we did it. We did it all the way back over here. There's three ways to get a squared b. We saw that right over there. And there are three ways to get a b squared. Three ways to get a b squared. And if you sum this up you have the expansion of a plus b to the third power. So hopefully you found that interesting.",math_engageny-precalc_precalc-3
" I'm now going to do one of my least favorite things to do by hand, and that is to invert a 3 by 3 matrix. And it can be useful because you can solve systems that way. But you'll see it's very computationally-intensive. And it is better to be done by a computer. And the only thing that's more painful is doing a 4 by 4 or a 4 by 5 matrix, which would-- or a 4 by 4 or a 5 by 5 matrix, which could take all day. And I'd probably, definitely make a careless mistake. But let's just take it step-by-step. So the first thing I'm going to do, this is my 3 by 3 matrix, is I'm going to construct a matrix of minors. So let me construct here a matrix of minors. And I'm going to draw this really big, right over here, to give ourselves some real estate. And the matrix of minors, what you do is, for each element in this matrix, you cross out the corresponding row, the corresponding column. And you replace it with the determit of the elements that are left. So what are left when you get rid of this row and this column, the minor is 1, 1, 4, 5. So the determit of 1, 1, 4, 5. Let's keep doing that. This will be replaced-- well I'll let you think about that first. What is this going to be replaced with? Well it's going to be replaced-- this row, this column. The determit of 2, 1, 3, 5. Let's keep going. Let's do this element. It's going to be replaced with the determit of, we get rid of this row, this column, 2, 1, 3, 4. We're a third of the way done, at least with this first stage of it. So for this element right here, it's going to be replaced with its minor. So we get rid of this row, this column. The determit of negative 2, 2, 4, 5. Then we have-- I'm trying to switch up the colors reasonably-- this element. Get rid of the middle row, middle column. You're left with the determit negative 1, 2, 3, 5. Now we move on to-- and I'm really running out of colors-- this element right over here, where its minor is-- we'll get rid of this row, this column-- negative 1, negative 2, 3, 4. So let me see that. Sorry, someone's car alarm started ringing outside. So let me make sure I didn't lose my focus here. I don't want to make any careless mistakes. This row, this column, negative 1, negative 2, 3, 4. All right. Now let's move over here. Get rid of the first column, last row. You have negative 2, 2, 1, 1. So we have negative 2, 2, 1, 1. Now let's move to this one. The middle column, bottom row, you have negative 1, 2, 2, 1. So we have negative 1, 2, 2, 1. And then we are in the home stretch for at least the matrix of minors. And so we are looking at this element right over here. Get rid of the last column, last row. You're left with negative 1, negative 2, 2, 1. So the determit of negative 1, negative 2, 2, 1. And from here we just have to evaluate each of these to get the actual matrix of minors. This is just a representation of it. So let's do that. So once again, we're still at the stage of getting our matrix of minors. And actually I don't have to write it as big anymore because now they're going to have numeric values. They're not going to be these little determits of two-by-twos. So what is the determit over here on the top left? Well it's going to be 1 times 5 minus 1 times 4. 1 times 5 minus 4 times 1. So it's going to be 5 minus 4, which is 1. What is the determit over here, this blue determit? Well it's going to be 2 times 5, which is 10, minus 3 times 1. So 10 minus 3 is 7. What is this determit, on the top right, going to evaluate to? Well you have 2 times 4 is 8, minus 3 times 1. So it's 8 minus 3, which is 5. Then we go over here. What is this determit going to evaluate to? We have negative 2 times 5 is negative 10, minus 4 times 2. So it's negative 10 minus 8, which is negative 18. Then we have negative 1 times 5, which is negative 5, minus 3 times 2. So it's negative 5 minus 6, which is negative 11. I want to do that in white, negative 11. What's this determit going to evaluate to? We have negative 1 times 4, negative 4, minus negative 6. So that's negative 4 plus 6, which is positive 2. I want to do that in that-- so that is positive 2. We have three left. What does this evaluate to? Negative 2 times 1 is negative 2, minus 1 times 2. So it's negative 2 minus 2 gets us to negative 4. Home stretch now. Negative 1 times negative 1 is negative 1, minus 2 times 2. So it's negative 1 minus 4, which is negative 5. And then finally we have negative 1 times 1 is negative 1, minus 2 times negative 2, so minus negative 4. So it's negative 1 minus negative 4. That's the same thing as adding a 4. So it's negative 1 plus 4. So it's going to be a positive 3. So this right over here is our true matrix of minors. And from there we can get our cofactor. We can get our cofactor matrix just by remembering a checkerboard pattern. So a checkerboard pattern tells us positive, negative, positive, negative, positive, negative, positive, negative, positive. It's a little self-explanatory why that's called a checkerboard. So if we sign this matrix of minors in this pattern, then we get our cofactor matrix. So let's set up our cofactor matrix right over here. So this is our cofactor. A lot of terminology, but hopefully it's making a little bit of sense. Our cofactor matrix. So we just have to apply these signs to these values, to the matrix of minors. So 1 is now going to have applied a positive sign to it. So it's still just going to be a positive 1. You're going to have 7, but it's going to have a negative sign applied to it. So it's going to be a negative 7. You have a 5, positive 5. The 5 is already positive. You multiply it times a positive, it's going to be a positive. You have negative 18, but then we have to multiply that times a negative. So you get positive 18. You have negative 11, multiply that times a positive 1. And so you still have negative 11. You have positive 2, multiply by a negative 1. You're going to have negative 2. Then you have negative 4, multiply by a positive 1. You still have negative 4. And then you have negative 5. What is this going to be in the cofactor matrix? Well you take a negative 5, multiply by a negative 1. You have a positive 5. And then finally, you have a positive 3, multiply by a positive 1. You're still going to have a positive 3. So we've gone pretty far in our journey, this very computationally-intensive journey-- one that I don't necessarily enjoy doing-- of finding our inverse by getting to our cofactor matrix. Now we just have to take this determit, multiply this times 1 over the determit and we're there. We've figured out the inverse of matrix C.",math_algebra-home_alg-matrices
" -  This right over here is the graph of x plus y is equal to one. Let's say the region that's below this graph but still in the first quadrant, that this is the base of a three dimensional figure. So this region right over here is the base of a three dimensional figure. What we know about this three dimensional figure is if we were to take cross sections that are perpendicular to the x axis, so cross sections I guess we could say that are parallel to the y axis, so let's say we were taking a cross-section like that, we know that this will be a semi-circle. If we take a slightly different view of the same three-dimensional, we would see something like this. I've laid the coordinate plane down flat and I'm looking at it from above. This cross-section, if we're looking at it at an angle, and if the figure were transparent, it would be this cross-section right over here. It would be that cross-section right over here, which is a semi-circle. If we were to take this cross section right over here, along the y axis, that would be this cross section. This larger semi-circle. Given what I've just told you, I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can figure out the volume of this thing that I've shaded in a little bit. The volume of this thing that I've just started. This three dimensional figure that we are attempting to visualize. I'm assuming you've had a go at it. One way to think about it is, well let's just think about each of these, let's split up the figure into a bunch of discs. If you figure out the volume of each of those discs, and sum them up then that would be a pretty good approximation for the volume of the whole thing. Then, if you took the limit as you get an infinite number of discs that are infinitely thin, then you're going to get the exact volume. Let's just take the approximating case first. Let's say that right over here at x, what is going to be the diameter of the disc at x. Well, to think about that we just have to re-express x plus y is equal to one. That's the same thing as saying that the function that F of x or y is equal to F of x is equal to one minus x. The diameter of this circle right over here, let me make it clear, the diameter of this circle is going to be this height, is going to be the difference between one minus x and the x axis, or between one minus x and x equals zero. This is just going to be, as a function of x, the diameter's going to be one minus x. Now, if you want to find the surface area for a circle, or if we want to find the area of a circle, we know that area is pi r-squared. For our semi-circle, you're going to divide by two. So what's the radius going to be? Just let me zoom in a little bit. What is the radius of one of these semi-circles going to be? The radius I could draw it like this. My best attempt to draw one of these things. It's gonna look something like this. I'm trying to draw it at an angle. The radius, what's gonna be half the diameter? The diameter is one minus x. The radius is going to be one minus x over two. Right, that distance is one minus x over two. That distance is one minus x over two. That distance is one minus x over two. So, that is one minus x over two is equal to the radius. What would be the area of of this side right over here? Well, if it was a full circle, it would be pi r-squared, but it's a semi-circle so it's pi r-squared over two. Let me write this, so the area is equal to pi r-squared over two 'cause it's a semi-circle. In terms of x, our area as a function of x right over there, let me write it that way, our area as a function of x, is gonna be pi over two. It's gonna be pi over two times one minus x over two squared. It's one minus x over two squared. If I wanted a volume of just this disc right over here, I, then, multiply that area times the depth. I just multiply the area times this depth here. We could call that d x or we could call that delta x. We could call the depth there delta x. Actually, let me be clear, that's the area. The volume of one of those shells is going to be equal to, and I'll just write this in one color, is gonna be pi over two times one minus x over two squared, times the depth. The area times the depth. This is volume of one of these half discs. The volume of the whole thing we can approximate is the sum of these, or we can take the limit is our delta x's get much, much, much, much, smaller and we have an infinite number of these things, which is essentially, if we're taking that limit, we're gonna take the definite integral. We could take the definite integral, so the volume that we care about, the volume of this figure, is going to be equal to the definite integral from x equals zero to x equals one. That's where we intersect the x axis. X equals zero to x equals one of, we're integrating an infinite number of these things that are infinitely thin. It's going to be pi over two times, what's one minus x-squared? Let me just expand it out for fun right over here. That's the same thing as x minus one squared. So it's going to be x squared minus two x plus one, and then two squared is four, over four. Instead of delta x, I'm going to right d x now. I'm gonna write d x because I'm taking the limit as these become infinitely small and I have an infinite nine. I'm summing an infinite number of them. The volume is just going to be, we just have to evaluate this definite integral. If you feel so inspired, feel free to pause and try to evaluate this definite integral. Let's just take some of these constants out. Let's take pi over eight out. Our volume is going to be equal to pi over eight times the definite integral from zero to one of x-squared minus two x plus one d x, which is equal to pi over eight. The antiderivative of this is x to the third over three minus x-squared plus x. We're going to evaluate that at zero and one. This is going to be equal to pi over eight. When you evaluate it at one, you get one third minus one plus one. It's going to be one third. When you evaluate at zero, you get zero minus zero plus zero. It's going to be minus zero so it's just pi over eight times one third which is equal to pi over 24 and we are done.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-applications-of-integration-new
" Joelle is working on a school report in a word processor. She wants to place a figure which is 13.09 centimeters wide so that it appears centered on the page. The width of the page is 21.59 centimeters. How much margin should she leave on the left so that the figure is centered? So let's visualize what's going on. We have a page that's 21.59 centimeters wide. So this distance right over here is 21.59 centimeters. So this right over here, that is our page. Let me draw the actual page. Let me draw that in white, since paper tends to be white. So this is her page. It's 21.59 centimeters wide. It's just like that. It's a little unusual dimension for a piece of paper. But we'll go with it. And then she wants to place a figure that is 13.09 centimeters wide in the center of the page. So the figure-- I'll do it in magenta. That's not magenta. The figure is 13.09 centimeters. So let's say that this is the figure right over here. So this is the figure that she wants to place in the middle of the page. So this is 13.09 centimeters. So the question is, how much margin should she leave on the left so that the figure is centered? So they're really asking, what should this distance be here so that the figure is centered? And the key thing is, if the figure is centered, this distance is going to be the same as this distance, so that the figure is right in the middle. Whatever this is, it's going to be the same as this. So one way we could think about it-- we could say, OK, let's take 13.09 centimeters from 21.59 centimeters. And if we do that, then we'll know how much leftover space this plus this combined is. And then we just want to split that space in half. We want half of it to go on the right side, and we want half of it to go on the left side. So let's see how much this left margin and the right margin combined need to be. And that's just 21.59. That's just going to be 21.59 centimeters minus 13.09 centimeters. And this, we get to-- let's see. This is 8.50 centimeters, which is the combined margins. Not just the left or not just the right-- this is the left plus the right margin, is 8.50 centimeters. This is this distance plus this distance. Now, if we want to figure out what the left margin should be, if we want to center it. Well, we just want to split this evenly between the left and the right margin. So we just want to divide this by 2. So if you divide 18.50 by 2-- or multiply it by 1/2, I guess. That might be a little bit more obvious-- either way. So if we multiply this by 1/2, you are left with 1/2 of 8.50, is 4.25 centimeters. So if we want it centered, this is going to be 4.25 centimeters. And of course, this is going to be 4.25 centimeters, as well. And you see, when you add 4.25 to 4.25, you get 8.5 centimeters. And then you add that to 13.09. You get the entire width of the piece of paper. So how much margin should she leave on the left? 4.25 centimeters.",math_cc-seventh-grade-math_cc-7th-fractions-decimals
" What I want to do in this video is find the area of this region that I'm shading in yellow. And what might seem challenging is that throughout this region, I have the same lower function. Or I guess the lower boundary is y is equal to x squared over 4 minus 1. But I have a different upper boundary. And the way that we can tackle this is by dividing this area into two sections, or dividing this region into two regions, the region on the left and the region on the right, where for this first region, which I'll do-- I'll color even more in yellow-- for this first region, over that entire interval in x. And it looks like x is going between 0 and 1. y equals-- when x is equal to 1, this function is equal to 1. When x is equal to 1, this function is also equal to 1. So this is the point 1 comma 1. That's where they intersect. So for this section, this subregion right over here, y equals square root of x is the upper function the entire time. And then we can have a-- we can set up a different-- we can separately tackle figuring out the area of this region. From x is equal to 1 to x is equal to 2, where y equals 2 minus x, is the upper function. So let's do it. So let's first think about this first region. Well, that's going to be the definite integral from x is equal to 0 to x is equal to 1. And our upper function is square root of x, so square root of x. And then from that, we want to subtract our lower function-- square root of x minus x squared over 4 minus 1. And then of course, we have our dx. So this right over here, this is describing the area in yellow. And you could imagine it, that this part right over here, the difference between these two functions is essentially this height. Let me do it in a different color. And then you multiply it times dx. You get a little rectangle with width dx. And then you do that for each x. Each x you get a different rectangle. And then you sum them all up. And you take the limit as your change in x approaches 0. So as you get ultra, ultra thin rectangles, and you have an infinite number of them. And that's our definition, or the Riemann definition of what a definite integral is. And so this is the area of the left region. And by the exact same logic, we could figure out the area of the right region. The right region-- and then we could just sum the two things together. The right region, we're going from x is equal to 0 to x-- sorry, x is equal to 1 to x is equal to 2, 1 to 2. The upper function is 2 minus x. And from that, we're going to subtract the lower function, which is x squared over 4 minus 1. And now we just have to evaluate. So let's first simplify this right over here. This is equal to the definite integral from 0 to 1 of square root of x minus x squared over 4 plus 1, dx-- I'm going to write it all in one color now-- plus the definite integral from 1 to 2 of 2 minus x, minus x squared over 4. Then subtracting a negative is a positive 3-- or a positive 1. We could just add it to this 2. And so this 2 just becomes a 3. I said 2 minus negative 1 is 3, dx. And now we just have to take the antiderivative and evaluate it at 1 and 0. So the antiderivative of this is-- well, this is x to the 1/2. Increment it by 1. Increment the power by 1, you get x to the 3/2, and then multiply by the reciprocal of the new exponent-- so it's 2/3 x to the 3/2. Minus-- the antiderivative of x squared over 4 is x to the third, divided by 3, divided by 4, so divided by 12, plus x. That's the antiderivative of 1. We're going to evaluate it at 1 and 0. And then here the antiderivative is going to be 3x minus x squared over 2 minus x to the third over 12. Once again, evaluate it at-- or not once again. Now we're going to evaluate at 2 and 1. So over here, you evaluate all of this stuff at 1. You get 2/3 minus 1/12 plus 1. And then from that, you subtract this evaluated at 0. But this is just all 0, so you get nothing. So this is what the yellow stuff simplified to. And then this purple stuff, or this magenta stuff, or mauve, or whatever color this is, first you evaluate it at 2. You get 6 minus-- let's see, 2 squared over 2 is 2, minus 8 over 12. And then from that, you're going to subtract this evaluated at 1. So it's going to be 3 times 1-- that's 3-- minus 1/2 minus 1 over 12. And now what we're essentially left with is adding a bunch of fractions. So let's see if we can do that. It looks like 12 would be the most obvious common denominator. So here you have 8/12 minus 1/12 plus 12/12. So this simplifies to-- what's this? This is 19/12, the part that we have in yellow. And then this business, let me do it in this color. So 6 minus 2, this is just going to be 4. So we can write this as 48/12-- that's 4-- minus 8/12. And then we're going to have to subtract a 3, which is 36/12. Then we're going to add to 1/2, which is just plus 6/12, and then we're going to add a 1/12. So this is all going to simplify to-- let's see, 48 minus 8 is 40, minus 36 is 4, plus 6 is 10, plus 1 is 11. So this becomes plus 11/12. Let me make sure I did that right. 48 minus 8 is 40, minus 36 is 4, 10, 11. So that looks right. And then we're ready to add these two. 19 plus 11 is equal to 30/12. Or if we want to simplify this a little bit, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by 6. This is equal to 5/2, or 2 and 1/2. And we're done. We figured out the area of this entire region. It is 2 and 1/2.",math_ap-calculus-ab_ab-applications-of-integration-new
" What I've got here is the graph of y is equal to cosine of x. What I want to do is figure out the area under the curve y is equal to f of x, and above the x-axis. I'm going to do it over various intervals. So first, let's think about the area under the curve, between x is equal to 0 and x is equal to pi over 2. So we're talking about this area right over here. Well, the way we denote it is the definite integral from 0 to pi over 2 of cosine of x dx. And remember, all this is, is kind of, it's reminiscent of taking a sum of a bunch of super thin rectangles with width dx and height f of x for each of those rectangles. And then you take an infinite number of those infinitely thin rectangles. And that's kind of what this notation is trying to depict. But we know how to do this already. The second fundamental theorem of calculus helps us. We just have to figure out what the antiderivative of cosine of x is. Or what an antiderivative of cosine of x is. Evaluate it at pi over 2, and from that subtract it evaluated at 0. So what's the antiderivative of cosine of x? Or what's an antiderivative? Well, we know if we take the derivative-- let me write this up here. We know that if we take the derivative of sine of x, we get cosine of x. So the antiderivative of cosine of x is sine of x Now, why do I keep saying sine of x is an antiderivative? It's not just the antiderivative. Well, I could also take the derivative of sine of x plus any arbitrary constant, and still get cosine of x. Because the derivative of a constant is 0. This could be pi, this could be 5, this could be a million, this could be a googol, this could be any crazy number. But the derivative of this is still going to be cosine x. So when I say that we just have to find an antiderivative, I'm just saying, look, we just have to find one of the derivatives. Sine of x is probably the simplest, because in this case the constant is 0. So let's evaluate. So one way that we can denote this, the antiderivative cosine, or an antiderivative of cosine of x is sine of x. And we're going to evaluate at pi over 2. And from that, subtract and evaluate it at 0. So this is going to be equal to-- let me do it right over here. This is going to be equal to sine of pi over 2 minus sine of 0, which is equal to sine of pi over 2 is 1. Sine of 0 is 0. So it's 1 minus 0 is equal to 1. So the area of this region right over here, this area is equal to 1. Now let's do something interesting. Let's think about the area. Let's think about the area under the curve between, let's say pi over 2 and 3 pi over 2. So between here and here. So we're talking about this area. We're talking about that area right over here. This is 3 pi over 2. So once again, the way we denote the area is the definite integral from pi over 2 to 3 pi over 2 of cosine of x dx. The antiderivative-- or an antiderivative of cosine of x is sine of x. Evaluated at 3 pi over 2 and pi over 2. So this is going to be equal to sine of 3 pi over 2 minus sine of pi over 2. What's sine of 3 pi over 2? If we visualize the unit circle really fast, 3 pi over 2 is going all the way 3/4 around the unit circle. So it's right over there. So sine is the y-coordinate on that unit circle. So it's negative 1. So this right over here is negative 1. This right over here, sine of pi over 2 is just going straight up like that. So sine of pi over 2 is 1. So this is interesting. We get negative 1 minus 1, which is equal to negative 2. We've got a negative area here. We got a negative area. Now how does that make sense? We know in the real world, areas are always positive. But what is negative 2 really trying to depict? Well, it's trying to sign it based on the idea that now our function is below the x-axis. So we could kind of think we have an area of 2, but it's all below the x-axis in this case. And so it is signed as negative 2. The actual area is 2, but since it's below the x-axis, we get a negative right over here. Now let's do one more interesting one. Let's find the definite integral from 0 to 3 pi over 2 of cosine of x dx. Now this is just denoting this entire area. Going from 0 all the way 3 pi over 2. And what do you think is going to happen? Well, let's evaluate it. It's going to be sine of 3 pi over 2 minus sine of 0. Which is equal to negative 1 minus 0, which is equal to negative 1. So what just happened here? The area under, all this orange area that I just outlined, is clearly not negative, or any area isn't a negative number. And the area isn't even 1. But what just happened here? Well, we saw in the first case that this first area was 1. The area of this first region right over here is 1. And then the area of the second region, we got negative 2. And so one way to interpret it is that your net area above the x-axis is negative 1, or another way to say it, your net area is negative 1. So it's taking the 1 region above the x-axis and subtracting the 2 below it. So what the definite integral is doing when we evaluate it using the second fundamental theorem of calculus, it's essentially finding the net area above the x-axis. And if we get a negative number, that means that the net area is act-- that actually most of the area is below the x-axis. If we get 0, then that means it all nets out. And if you want to see a case that's 0, take the integral from 0 all the way all the way 2 pi. And this will evaluate to 0 because you have an area of 1 and another area of 1, but it nets out with this area of negative 2. Let's try that out. So if we go from 0 to 2 pi of cosine of x dx, this is going to be equal to sine of 2 pi minus sine of 0, which is equal to 0 minus 0, which is indeed equal to 0. Now clearly there was area here, but all of the area that was above the x-axis netted out with all the area that was below the x-axis.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-definite-integrals
" -  We already have a lot of experience with the geometric series. For example, if I have the infinite geometric series starting at N equals K to infinity of R to the N, which would be R to the K plus R to the K plus one plus R to the K plus two and keep going on and on and on forever. There are a few things we've already thought about here. We know what the common ratio is. So the common ratio, which is the ratio between consecutive terms, is going to be R to the K plus one. Actually, let me just write this as R to the N plus one. I don't want to fixate on this K right over here. So R to the N plus one over R to the N. Well, this is just going to be equal to R. Anything to the N plus one over that same thing with the N, that's just going to be equal to R, or R to the first power, and you see that here. When you go from one term to another you are just multiplying, you are just multiplying by R, and this is all review. If it is not review, I encourage you to watch the videos on geometric series. And what's interesting about this is we've proven to ourselves, in the videos about geometric series, that if the common ratio, if the absolute value of the common ratio is less than one, then the series converges. And if the absolute value of R is greater than or equal to one, then the series diverges. And that makes sense, we've proven it as well, but it also makes logical sense that, look, if that absolute value of R is less than one then each term here is going to go down by that common, or it's going to be multiplied by that common ratio, and it's going to decrease on and on and on and on until it makes sense that, even though this is an infinite sum, it will converge to a finite value. Now, with that out of the way for review, let's tackle something a little bit more interesting. Let's say that we want to look at a, we want to figure out whether a series like this, so starting at N equals five to infinity of, let's say, N to the tenth power. The numerator is growing quickly. N to the tenth power over N factorial, and factorial we know also grows very, very quickly, probably it grows much faster than even a high degree polynomial like this, or a high degree term like this, but how do we prove that it converges? We could definitely the diverges test to show that this does not diverge, but how do we prove that this actually converges? And maybe we can use a little bit of our intuition here. Well, let's see if we can come up with a common ratio. So let's see if there's a common ratio here. So let's take the N plus oneth term, which is going to be N plus one to the tenth power over N plus one factorial and divide that by the Nth term, so let's divide that by N to the tenth over N factorial. Well, dividing by a fraction, or dividing by anything, is equivalent to multiplying by it's reciprocal, So let's just multiply by the reciprocal, so times N factorial over N to the tenth. Remember all I'm trying to do is exactly right over here. See if there is some type of a common ratio. Well, if we do a little algebra here N plus one factorial, and factorial algebra is always fun. This is the same thing as N plus one times N factorial. Times N factorial. You're not use to seeing order of operations with factorials, but this factorial only applies to this N right over here, and why is that useful? Because this N factorial cancels with this N factorial, and we're left with N plus one to the tenth power over N plus one times N to the tenth. Times N to the tenth. So I know what you're thinking. ""Hey, wait, look, this isn't a fixed common ratio here."" The ratio between consecutive terms here, when I took the N plus oneth term divided by the Nth term, it's changing depending on what my N is. This ratio, I guess you could say, is a function of N so this doesn't seem too useful, but what if I were to say, ""O.K., well look, with any of these series ""we really care about the behavior as our N's ""get really, really, really large as the limit, as our N's, go to infinity."" So what if we were to look at the behavior here, and if this is approaching some actual values as N approaches infinity, well, it would make conceptual sense that we could kind of think of that as the limit of our common ratio. So let's do that. Let's take the limit as N approaches infinity of this thing. So remember what we're doing here. This isn't just kind of some voodoo. Conceptually, let me copy and paste this. Conceptually, we're just trying to think about what is the common ratio approach? What is the ratio between consecutive terms? The N plus one term and the Nth term as N gets really, really, really, really large? And what we see here is we have this up here, we don't even have to multiply it out, this is going to be N to the tenth plus a bunch of other stuff. It's going to be a tenth degree polynomial, and this down here is going to be, actually you can figure it out, this is going to be N to the 11th plus N to the tenth power, so the limit as N approaches infinity, well this denominator is going to grow faster than that. You could divide the numerator and the denominator by N to the tenth, actually the numerator and the denominator by N to the 11th, and everything up here is going to go to zero, and this is going to be one, and so the limit, right over here, this limit is going to be equal to... This limit is going to be equal to zero. As N approaches infinity one way the ratio between consecutive terms approaches zero. So this seems, if we use the logic from our common ratio up here when we looked at geometric series, this is clearly not a geometric series, but we would say, ""Well, look, as N gets really, really, really large the ratio between ""consecutive terms gets smaller and smaller and smaller. ""Hey, maybe we could make the same conclusion. ""Maybe we could make the same conclusion that ""therefore this series actually converges."" The series actually converges, so N factorial converges. So can we make this statement? And the answer is yes we can, and what allows us to do it is the ratio test. Is the ratio test. Let me write that down. The ratio test. And all the ratio test tells us is if we have an infinite series... If we have an infinite series, and I can say from N equals K to infinity, and if we take the limit as N approaches infinity, of the absolute value of A to the N plus one over A to the N, and over here I didn't take the absolute value of that limit, but we absolutely could have taken the absolute value of that limit if all of these terms right over here were positive, so the absolute value would be the same thing as itself. If this approaches some limit, if this approaches some limit, so once again, this limit is what is going to be our ratio between consecutive terms as N gets larger and larger, the ratio tells us if L is less than one, which was the situation here, L is clearly less than one, then the series converges. Some definitions will say it's absolutely convergent, it converges absolutely, the absolute value of the series converges, but then that also means that the series itself converges. If L is greater than one then series diverges, Series diverges. and if L is equal to one it's inconclusive, we don't know. We would have to do some other test to prove whether it converges or diverges. So that's the essence of the ratio test. Find the absolute value of the ratio between consecutive terms, take the limit as N approaches infinity, if that approaches an actual limit, and that limit is less than one, then the series converges, and it's really based on the same fundamental idea that we saw with the common ratio of geometric series.",math_old-integral-calculus_convergence-tests-integral-calc
" Let's say that I've got some angle theta, some angle theta right over here. And I'm drawing it on our unit circle with a typical convention that we started with a ray that's along the positive X axis, and the terminal side of this angle, is the terminal side of the angle, where it intersects the unit circle, determines essentially the sine and cosine of that theta, so the cosine of theta is the X... is the... let me just set a color I haven't used before. The cosine of theta is the X coordinate of where this terminal ray intersects the unit circle. Or another way of thinking about it is the cosine of theta is the length of what I'm drawing in purple right over here. It's this length. That length right over there is cosine of theta, and the sine of theta is the Y coordinate. Or another way of thinking about it the sine of theta is the length of this line right over here. The how high you are above the X axis, that is essentially the Y coordinate, and so the length of that is sine theta. And this makes sense, this actually shows why the unit circle definition is an extension of the Soh Cah Toa definition. Remember, Soh Cah Toa. Let me write it down. Soh Cah Toa. Soh Cah Toa. So sine is opposite over hypotenuse. So if I want to do the sine of theta, what's it going to be? So if I think about the sine of theta, sine of theta by the Soh Cah Toa definition, it's going to be equal to the length of the opposite side. Well, we're saying that that's sine of theta, it's sine of theta, over the hypotenuse. Well the hypotenuse here, this is a unit circle, so it's going to be one. So this shows that this is consistent. Or another way of thinking about it, sine of theta is equal to the opposite side over the hypotenuse. In this case it's going to be equal to the opposite side, and what's the hypotenuse? This is a unit circle, so it's going to be one. In this case, sine of theta is equal to the length of the opposite side. The length of the opposite side is equal to sine theta. And same exact logic. The cosine of theta is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse, is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse. And so that's... since the hypotenuse is equal to one, it's just the length of the adjacent side, so cosine of theta is the length of the adjacent side. So this is all a little bit of review, just showing how the unit circle definition is an extension of the Soh Cah Toa definition. But now let's do something interesting. This is the angle theta. Let's think about the angle theta plus pi over two. So the angle theta plus pi over two. So if I were to essentially add pi over two to this, I'm going to get a ray that is perpendicular to the first ray, pi over two. If we think in degrees, pi over two radians, so when I say theta plus pi over two, I'm talking in radians. Pi over two radians is equivalent to 90 degrees. So we're essentially adding 90 degrees to it. So this angle right over here, that angle right over here is theta plus pi over two. Now, what I want to explore in this video, and I guess this is the interesting part of the video, is can we relate sin of theta plus pi over two to somehow sine of theta or cosine of theta? I encourage you to pause this video and try to think this through on your own before I work it out. Well let's think about what sine of theta plus pi over two is. We know from the unit circle definition, the sine of this angle, which is theta plus pi over two, is the Y coordinate. It's that, it's this value right over here. Or another way of thinking about it, it's the length of this line in magenta. This right over here is the sine of theta, plus pi over two. So that right over there. Now how does that relate to what we have over here? Well when you look at it, it looks like we just took this triangle, and we just kind of... we rotated it. We rotated it counter clockwise by 90 degrees, which essentially what we did do. Because we took this terminal side, and we added 90 degrees to it, or pi over two radians. And if you want to get a little bit more rigorous about it, if this whole white angle here is theta plus pi over two, and the part that's in the first quadrant is pi over two, then this part right over here, that must be equal to theta. And if we think about it, if we try to relate the side this side that I've put in magenta relative to this angle theta using the Soh Cah Toa definition, here, relative to this angle theta in yellow, this is the adjacent side. So let's think about it a little bit. So if we were.. so what deals with the adjacent and the hypotenuse, and in this case of course our hypotenuse has length one, this is a unit circle, what cosine deals with adjacent and hypotenuse? So we could say that the cosine of this theta so the cosine of that theta is equal to the adjacent side, the length of the adjacent side which we already know is sine of theta plus pi over two. Let me write it this way. Sine of theta plus pi over two. over the hypotenuse. Over the hypotenuse, which is just one, so that doesn't change its value. So that was pretty neat. Just like that, we were able to come up with a pretty neat relationship between cosine and sine. The cosine of theta is equal to sine of theta plus pi over two, or you could say sine of theta plus pi over two is equal to cosine of theta. Now what I encourage you to do is, after this video, see if you can come up with other results. Think about what happens to... what sine of theta relates to? Or what cosine of theta plus pi over two might relate to? So I encourage you to explore that on your own.",math_engageny-precalc_precalc-4
" -  Let's say that we run a school and in that school there is a population of students right over here. And that is our population. And we want to get a sense of how these students feel about the quality of math instruction at the school, so we construct a survey, and we just need to decide who are we going to get to actually answer this survey. One option is to just go to every member of the population, but let's just say it's a really large school. Let's say we're a college and there's 10,000 people in the college. We say, well, we can't just talk to everyone. So instead, we say, let's sample this population to get an indication of how the entire school feels. So we are going to sample it. We are going to sample that population. Now in order to avoid having bias in our response, in order for it to have the best chance of it being indicative of the entire population, we want our sample to be random. So our sample could either be random, random, or not random. Not random. And it might seem, at first, pretty straightforward to do a random sample, but when you actually get down to it, it's not always as straightforward as you would think. So one type of random sample is just a simple random sample. So, simple, simple, random, random, sample, and this is saying, alright, let me maybe assign a number to every person in the school, maybe they already have a student ID number, and I'm just going to get a computer, a random number generator, to generate the 100 people, the 100 students, so let's say there's a sample of 100 students, that I'm going to apply the survey to, so that would be a simple random sample. We are just going into this whole population and randomly, let me just draw this. So this is the population, we are just randomly picking people out, and we know it's random because a random number generator, or we have a string of numbers or something like that, that is allowing us to pick the students. Now that's pretty good, it's unlikely that you're going to have bias from this sample, but there is some probability that, just by chance, your random number generator just happened to select maybe a disproportionate number of boys over girls, or a disproportionate number of freshmen, or a disproportionate number of engineering majors versus English majors, and that's a possibility. So even though you are taking a simple random sample that is truly random, once again, it's some probability that it's not indicative of the entire population. And so to mitigate that, there are other techniques at our disposal. One technique is a stratified sample. Stratified. And so this is the idea of taking our entire population and essentially stratifying it. So let's say we want to, we take that same population, we take that same population, I'll draw it as a square here just for convenience, and we're gonna stratify it by, let's say we're concerned that we get a appropriate sample of freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. So we'll stratify it by freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, and then we sample 25 from each of these groups. So these are the stratifications. This is freshmen, sophomore, juniors, and seniors, and instead of just sampling 100 out of the entire pool, we sample 25 from each of these. So just like that. And so that makes sure that you are getting indicative responses from at least all of the different age groups or levels within your university. Now there might be another issue where you say, well, I'm actually more concerned that we have accurate representation of males and females in the school, and there is some probability, you know, if I do 100 random people, it's very likely that it's close to 50/50, but there's some chance, just due to randomness, there's disproportionately male or disproportionately female. And that's even possible in the stratified case. And so what you might say is, well, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm going to, there's a technique called a clustered sample. Let me write this right over here, clustered, a clustered sample, and what we do is we sample groups. Each of those groups we feel confident has a good balance of male females. So, for example, we might, instead of sampling individuals from the entire population, we might say, look, you know, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and this, well, even there as you can tell this is not a trivial thing to do, let's just say that we can split, let's say we can split our population into groups, maybe these are classrooms, and each of these classrooms have an even distribution of males and females, or pretty close to even distributions. And so what we do is we sample the actual classrooms, so that's why it's called cluster, or cluster technique, or clustered random sample, because we're going to randomly sample our classrooms, each of which have a close or maybe a exact balance of males and females so we know that we're gonna get good representation, but we are still sampling, we are sampling from the clusters, but then we're gonna survey every single person in each of these clusters, every single person in one of these classrooms. So, once again, these are all forms of random surveys, or random samples, you have the simple random sample, you can stratify, or you can cluster and then randomly pick the clusters and then survey everyone in that cluster. Now if these are all random samples, what are the non-random things like? Well, one case of non-random, you could have a voluntary survey, or voluntary sample, and this might just be you tell every student at the school, ""Hey, here's a web address. ""If you're interested, come and fill out this survey."" And that's likely to introduce bias because you might have maybe the students who really like the math instruction at their school more likely to fill it out, maybe the students who really don't like it are more likely to fill it out, maybe it's just the kids who have more time more likely to fill it out. So this has a good chance of introducing bias. The students who fill out the survey might be just more skewed one way or the other because, you know, they volunteered for it. Another not random sample would be called you're introducing bias because of convenience is the term that's often used, and this might say, well, let's just sample the 100 first students who show up in school. And that's just convenient for me because I didn't have to use random numbers, or do the stratification, or doing any of this clustering, but you can understand how this also would introduce bias, because the first 100 students who show up at school, maybe those are the most diligent students, maybe they all take an early math class that has a very good instructor where they're all happy about it. Or it might go the other way, the instructor there isn't the best one, and so it might introduce bias the other way. So if you let people volunteer or you just say, ""Oh, let me do the first N students."" Or you say, ""Hey, let me just talk to all of the students ""who happen to be in front of me right now."" They might be in front of you out of convenience, but they might not be a true random sample. Now there is other reasons why you might introduce bias, and it might not be because of the sampling. You might introduce bias because of the wording of your survey. You could imagine a survey that says, do you consider yourself lucky to get a math education that very few other people in the world have access to? Well, that might bias you to say, ""Well, yeah, I guess I feel lucky."" Well, if the wording was, do you like the fact that a disproportionate more students at your school tend to fail algebra than our surrounding schools? Well, that might bias you negatively. So the wording really, really, really matters in surveys, and there is a lot that would go into this. And the other one is just people's, you know, it's called response bias. And, once again, this isn't about... Response bias. And this is just people not wanting to tell the truth or maybe not wanting to respond at all. Maybe they're afraid that somehow their response is gonna show up in front of their math teacher or the administrators, or if they're too negative, it might be taken out on them in some way. And because of that, they might not be truthful, and so they might be overly positive or not fill it out at all. So anyway, this is a very high level overview of how you could think about sampling. You want to go random because it lowers the probability of their introducing some bias into it. And then these are some techniques. And also think about whether you're falling into some of these pitfalls that have a good chance of introducing bias.",math_statistics-probability_designing-studies
" We're asked to represent the inequality y is greater than 5 on a number line and on the coordinate plane. Let's do the number line first. Let me just draw out a number line. That's my number line, all the possible values of y. Let's make that 0 on the number line. We could obviously go into negative numbers, but we're going to be greater than 5, so I'll focus on the positive side. So let's say that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and then 6, 7, so forth and so on. This number line represents y, and y is going to be greater than 5, not greater than or equal to. So we're not going to be including 5 in the numbers that can be y. So we're not going to include 5, so we're going to do an open circle around 5, and all of the other values greater than 5 will be included. So if there was a greater than or equal to sign, we would have filled it in, but since it's just greater than, we're not including the 5. So we've represented it on the number line. Let's do the same thing on the coordinate plane. Let me draw a coordinate plane here. I'm just using the standard convention. That is my y-axis right there. And then the horizontal axis, I'll just assume is my x-axis. Let me draw some y values, positive y values. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. That is 5 right there, and you go 6, 7, you can just keep going into larger and larger numbers. And we want y to be greater than 5, so it's not going to be greater than or equal to. So we're not going to include 5. So at 5, at y is equal to 5, we will draw a dotted line. That shows that we're not including y is equal to 5, but we want include all of the other values greater than 5. So that we will shade in. So here we have shaded in all of the values greater than 5. If it was greater than or equal to 5, we would have drawn a bold line over here. So no matter what x is, no matter what x we pick, y is going to be greater than 5.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-linear-inequalities-icse
" Let's say that we're told that this sum right over here, where our index starts at 2 and we go all the way to infinity, that this infinite series is negative 8/5 plus 16/7 minus 32/9 plus-- and we just keep going on and on forever. And so what I want to do is to explicitly define what a sub n is here. So right now we just say, hey, if you take the sum of a sub n from n equals 2 to infinity, it turns out you get this sum right over here. But let's think about what a sub n-- how we can actually define it in terms of n. And I encourage you to pause the video right now and try it on your own. So the first thing that you might realize is, well, this is the number that we're going to get. Let me write it this way. a sub 2 is equal to negative 8/5. a sub 3 is equal to 16/7. a sub 4 is equal to negative 32/9. And I'm just giving the sign to the number in the numerator. Negative 8/5 is the same thing as negative 8 over 5. Let me make that a little bit clearer. So I'll make that a little bit clearer. So this is negative 8/5. Obviously, this is positive, so I don't have to really worry about it too much. And then here, I'm just saying negative 32/9, so it's the same thing as negative 32 over 9. So let's see if we can first find a pattern in the numerator. So when we go from negative 8 to 16, what's happening? Well, we're multiplying by negative 2. Now, to go from 16 to negative 32, we're multiplying by negative 2 again. So you might say, OK, well, whatever we have in the numerator must be a power of negative 2. And, all right, if you say, well, maybe this is negative 2 squared, well, you know that negative 8 isn't negative 2 squared. Negative 2 squared is equal to positive 4. Negative 8-- this right over here. Negative 8, that is equal to negative 2 to the third power. 16 is equal to negative 2 to the fourth power. Negative 32 is equal to negative 2 to the fifth power. So notice, our exponent on the negative 2 is always going to be one more than our index. Our index is 2, our exponent is 3. Our index is 3, our exponent is 4. Our index is 4, our exponent is 5. So that gives a sense that at least the numerator is going to be-- whatever our index is, it's going to be-- so let me write this down. So a sub n is equal to-- well, it's going to be negative 2 to whatever index we're at, to that index plus 1 power. So that's a reasonable way to think about our numerator. Now let's think about our denominators. So over-- So we go from 5, so when n is 2, we're at 5. When n is 3, we're at 7. When n is 4, we're at 9. So notice, 5 is 2 times 2 plus 1. This right over here is 2 times 3 plus 1. This right over here is 2 times 4 plus 1. And you should just kind of play around with different patterns in your head until you say, hey, well, look, this is increasing by 2 every time. Notice, this increases by 2 every time. But these aren't exactly multiples of 2. These seem to be off by one more than the multiples of 2, which is a good sign that this is going to be 2 times our index plus 1. So we could write this as 2 times our index plus 1. And we're done. That's what a sub n is. And if we wanted to write this series in sigma notation, we would write this as the sum from n equals 2 to infinity of negative 2 to the n plus 1 power over 2n plus 1. And that would equal this series right over here.",math_integral-calculus_ic-series
" -  Let's see if we can find the limit as h approaches zero of five log of two plus h minus five log of two, all of that over h. And I'll give you a little bit of a hint because I know you're about to pause the video and try to work through it. Think of your derivative properties, especially the derivatives of logarithmic functions, especially logarithmic functions in this case with a base 10. If someone just writes log without the base, you can just assume that that is a 10 right over there. So pause the video, and see if you can work through it. Alright, so the key here is to remember that if I have, if I have f of x, let me do it over here, I'll do it over here. F of x and I want to find f prime of, let's say f prime of some number, let's say a, this is going to be equal to the limit as x, or sorry, as h approaches zero is one way of thinking about it, as h approaches zero of f of a plus h, minus f of a, all of that over h. So this looks pretty close to that limit definition, except we have these fives here. But lucky for us we can factor out those fives, and we could factor them out, we could factor them out out front here, but if you just have a scale or times the expression, we know from our limit properties we can actually take those out of the limit themselves. So let's do that, let's take both of these fives, and factor them out, and so this whole thing is going to simplify to five times the limit as h approaches zero of log of two plus h, minus, minus log of two, all of that over h. Now, you might recognize what we have in yellow here, cause think about it, what this is, if we had f of x is equal to log of x, and we wanted to know what f prime of, well actually let's say f prime of two is, well this would be the limit as h approaches zero of log of two plus h, two plus h, minus log of two, minus log of two, all of that over h. So this is really just a, what we see there, this by definition this right over here is, is f prime of two. If f of x is log of x, this is f prime of two, f prime of two. So can we figure that out? If f of x is log of x, what is f prime of x? F prime of x, we don't need to use the limit definition. In fact the limit definition is quite hard to evaluate this limit, but we know how to take the derivative of logarithmic functions. So f prime of x is going to be equal to one over the natural log of our base, our base here we already talked about that, that is 10. So one over natural log of 10, times, times, times x. If this was a natural log, well, then, this would be one over natural log of e times x, natural log of e is just one, so that's where you get the one over x, but if you have any other base you put the natural log of that base right over here in the denominator. So what is f prime of two? F prime of two is one over the natural log of 10, times two. So this whole thing has simplified, this whole thing is equal to five times this business. So I could actually just write it as it's equal to five over, five over the natural log of 10, natural log of 10, times two, I could have written it as two natural log of 10s. The key here for this type of exercise, you might be a little let me see if I can evaluate this limit? You're like whoa, this looks a lot like the derivative of a logarithmic function, especially the derivative when x is equal to two, if we could just factor these fives out. So you factor out the fives, and say hey, this is, this is the derivative of log of x when x is equal to two, and so we know how to take the derivative of log of x. If you don't know we have videos where we prove this. Where you take the derivatives of logarithms with bases other than e, and you just use that to actually and you find the derivative, and you evaluate it at two, and then you're done!",math_calculus-1_cs1-derivatives-chain-rule-and-other-advanced-topics
" We're asked to look at the table below. From the information given, is there a functional relationship between each person and his or her height? So a good place to start is just think about what a functional relationship means. Now, there's definitely a relationship. They say, hey, if you're Joelle, you're 5-6. If you're Nathan, you're 4-11. If you're Stewart, you're 5-11. That is a relationship. Now, in order for it to be a functional relationship, for every instance or every example of the independent variable, you can only have one example of the value of the function for it. So if you say if this is a height function, in order for this to be a functional relationship, no matter whose name you put inside of the height function, you need to only be able to get one value. If there were two values associated with one person's name, it would not be a functional relationship. So if I were to ask you what is the height of Nathan? Well, you'd look at the table and say, well, Nathan's height is 4 foot 11. There are not two heights for Nathan. There is only one height. And for any one of these people that we can input into the function, there's only one height associated with them, so it is a functional relationship. We can even see that on a graph. Let me graph that out for you. Let's see, the highest height here is 6 foot 1. So if we start off with one foot, two feet, three feet, four feet, five feet, and six feet. And then if I were to plot the different names, the different people that I could put into our height function, we have-- I'll just put the first letters of their names. We have Joelle, we have Nathan, we have Stewart, we have LJ, and then we have Tariq right there. So lets plot them. So you have Joelle, Joelle's height is 5-6, so 5-6 is right about there. Then you have Nathan. Let me do it in a different color. Nathan's height is 4-11. We will plot to him right over there. Then you have Stewart. Stewart's height is 5-11. He is pretty close to six feet. So Stewart's height-- I made him like six feet; let me make it a little lower-- is 5-11. Then you have LJ. LJ's height is 5-6. So you have two people with a height of 5-6, but that's OK, as long as for each person you only have one height. And then finally, Tariq is 6 foot 1. He's the tallest guy here. Tariq is right up here at 6 foot 1. So notice, for any one of the inputs into our function, we only have one value, so this is a functional relationship. Now, you might say OK, well, isn't everything a functional relationship? No! If I gave you the situation, if I also wrote here-- let's say the table was like this and I also wrote that Stewart is 5 foot 3 inches. If this was our table, then we would no longer have a functional relationship because for the input of Stewart, we would have two different values. If we were to graph this, we have Stewart here at 5-11, and then all of a sudden, we would also have Stewart at 5-3. Now, this doesn't make a lot of sense, so we would plot it right over here. So for Stewart, you would have two values, and so this wouldn't be a valid functional relationship because you wouldn't know what value to give if you were to take the height of Stewart. In order for this to be a function, there can only be one value for this. You don't know in this situation when I add this, whether it's 5-3 or 5-11. Now, this wasn't the case, so that isn't there and so we know that the height of Stewart is 5-11 and this is a functional relationship. I think to some level, it might be confusing, because it's such a simple idea. Each of these values can only have one height associated with it. That's what makes it a function. If you had more than one height associated with it, it would not be a function.",math_math1_functions
" -  Let's continue thinking about how rational agents make decisions. So here we're told that Sally runs a business that only sells hamburgers in a building she owns. Every month, they sell 5,000 hamburgers at $5 per hamburger. She spends $2 per hamburger on supplies, bread, meat, lettuce, et cetera. She also pays Mike and Raj each $2,500 per month to work at the restaurant. Finally, utilities cost $500 per month. Sally works full-time at the restaurant and keeps the accounting profits for herself. What is the accounting profit of the business? So pause this video and see if you can figure that out. All right now let's think about this together. We're gonna think about it in terms of some of the types of costs we've thought about in the past. So when we think about benefits, and here we could think about it to a firm, although it's fully owned by Sally, the benefit to a firm of doing business is its revenue. So the total revenue that she collects, and everything we're gonna be doing is going to be per month, so her total revenue is going to be her price times quantity so it's going to be 5,000 hamburgers at $5 per hamburger. So that is going to be $25,000. Once again, all of this is going to be per month. So once again, we can view this as the total benefit that the firm, that her business, is getting. And now let's think about the costs. So first we could think about the cost of her supplies. It's oftentimes referred to costs of goods sold, but I'll just write supplies here. So costs, costs colon, so let's put supplies, supplies. That would be 5,000 hamburgers times $2 per hamburger, so that's a $10,000 cost, $10,000. Then she has the cost of her employees. So employees, I'll just write it, I'll abbreviate it like that. What's that going to be? Well she has two folks at $2,500 per month each. So that's going to be $5,000, two times $2,500, $5,000. And then last but not least, she has her utilities. So utilities, let's do util for short. That's going to be $500 per month. And so from this we can calculate the accounting profit. So we get the accounting profit, accounting profit, is going to be 25,000 minus 15,500. That's going to be $9,500 per month. And she gets to keep all of this, and so this seems like a pretty good amount of money to be earning. She's earning six figures a year. But the question is, is it rational for her to do this? Well some of you might be correctly thinking, well in order to determine whether it's rational for her to continue running this business, we have to know what the implicit costs are. Here we've only just looked at the explicit costs, and the most important of the implicit costs is the opportunity cost. And to factor that, we have to know, well maybe what she could've rented her building out, if she wasn't running this burger business, and maybe what she could do with her time if she wasn't working at the business full-time. So we need a little bit more information and let's see if we can get that. So now we are told that Sally could rent out her building for $5,000 per month. She can also make $6,000 per month as an accountant. Based on this, what is the economic profit of her business? So pause this video and see if you can figure this out. Well one way to think about it is, we can start with our accounting profit and then subtract out all the implicit costs, especially these opportunity costs right over here. So her opportunity cost, opportunity costs, are going to be per month, well if she doesn't run this business, she could rent out her building for $5,000 per month and then if she wasn't doing this full-time, she could make $6,000 per month as an accountant, $6,000 right over there. And so her opportunity costs are a total of $11,000. And so now her economic profit would be her total benefit minus her explicit costs minus her implicit costs. Her economic profit, economic profit, is going to be, well we could start at the 9,500 and subtract the 11,000, it is negative $1,500. It's important to realize, because economic profit always factors in the explicit costs and then other potential implicit costs, economic profit will never be higher than accounting profit. And assuming there are some implicit costs, it'll always be lower than accounting profit. So now based on all of what we've explored, is it rational for Sally to continue running her burger business? Well based on the information we've been given, it doesn't seem rational for her to continue running her burger business. She makes $9,500 in accounting profit from the business, but she's incurring $11,000 of opportunity cost to do so. And that's what makes her economic profit negative. This is not rational. Now if we had more information, maybe she hates being an accountant. Maybe there's a benefit for her working at the burger business. She has more flexibility with her time, she likes being self-employed, she doesn't have to listen to her manager tell her want to do. If that were the case, then it would change the calculations some because there would be an extra benefit from her running her burger joint. But we don't know, and based on the information we have, it doesn't seem rational for her to continue.",economics-finance-domain_ap-microeconomics_basic-economic-concepts
"  I want to make little townhouse shapes with toothpicks. So this would be my first townhouse. I've used 3 toothpicks so far-- 4, 5, and 6. So that is my first townhouse. Now, let me make a little table here keeping track of things. So I'll do that in white. So here's my table to keep track of things. So this is the number of houses, and then this is the toothpicks that I'm using to make that house. So this first house here, took me 6 toothpicks-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Now let's make our second house. And these are going to be townhouses. They're going to share common walls. So I'm going to add 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks for my second house. Now, why did I only have to add 5 and not 6? Well, they shared a common wall here so I didn't have to add another toothpick here for this left-hand side wall. So starting with the first house, I really just had to add 5 toothpicks. I had to add 5 toothpicks to get to now 11 total toothpicks if I want two houses. I think you see the trend here. What about 3 of these? Well, this is going to be another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toothpicks. So we're going to add 5 again and get to 16. Let's do 4 just for good measure. So the fourth one, we're going to add another 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So the fourth one, we're going to add another 5 gets us to 21. Now, I want to think about, can we, using this pattern, figure out how many toothpicks it would take for us to, say, make 50 of these townhouses or even 500 of these townhouses, or even 5,000 of them? Now we just have to look at this pattern here and see can we come up with an equation for each of these actual values? So, for example, we see a pattern that-- well, we already recognize that we started with 6, and we're adding 5 every time we add a house. So when you add the second house, you add 5 once. The third house, you start with 6, and you add 5 twice. The fourth house, you start with 6 and you add 5 three times. So let's actually write that down. So 21 is equal to-- you start with 6, you start with this 6 here, and then you add 5 three times, plus 5 times 3. When you had the 3 houses, once again, you started with 6 and you added 5 two times. Let me do that same color. And you added 5 two times. Plus 5 times 2. When you had 2 houses, you started with 6 again. This is equal to 6 and you added 5 once, so plus 5 times 1. And then when you had 1 house-- and it'll fit the same pattern-- you started with 6, and how many times did you add 5? Well, you didn't add 5. You could say that you added 5 zero times. So you might see a little pattern here. However many houses you needed, you take one less than that and multiply it by 5, add that to 6, and you get the number of toothpicks. And actually, let me rewrite this. So I could rewrite this as 6 plus 5 times 4 minus 1. I could write this as 6 plus 5 times 3 minus 1. You could write this as 6 plus 5 times 2 minus 1. You could rewrite this as 6 plus 5 times 1 minus 1. And maybe that makes a pattern a little bit clearer. This 4 is right over here. This 3 is right over here. This 2 is right over here. And then this 1 is right over here. So now, I think we are ready to think about what would happen if we wanted to make 50 houses. So let's try to do that. Let me do that in orange. This right over here is our 50th house. So this is the shared left wall it has. This is the 50th house right over here. So how many total toothpicks for 50 houses? So if we have 50 houses, well, we can use the pattern that we came up with. It's going to be equal to, starting with our 6, the first house requires 6. And then we're going to add 5 for each incremental house, so plus 5 for each incremental house. And how many incremental houses are there going to be? Well, there are going to be 50 minus 1 incremental houses. Why minus 1? Well, you already built one of them with the 6. Then for every extra one-- so there's going to be 49 extra houses-- you're going to add 5 toothpicks apiece. So this is going to be equal to 6 plus 5 times 49. And that is 245. So 6 plus 245 is equal to 251 sticks. And what's really neat about this pattern we just came up with is you could use it to figure out how many sticks you would need for a million of these little toothpick townhouses.

" Use graphing to solve the following problem. Abby and Ben did household chores last weekend. Together they earned $50, and Abby earned $10 more than Ben. How much did they each earn? So let's define some variables here. Let's let A equal Abby's earnings. And let's let B equal Ben's earnings. Then they tell us how these earnings relate. They first tell us that together they earned $50. So that statement can be converted mathematically into-- well, together, that means the sum of the two earnings. So A plus B needs to be equal to $50. Abby's plus Ben's earnings is $50. And then they tell us Abby earned $10 more than Ben. So we could translate that into Abby's earnings is equal to Ben's earnings plus 10. Abby earned $10 more than Ben. So we have a system of two equations and actually with two unknowns. And then they say, how much did each earn? So to do that, and they want us to solve this graphically. There's multiple ways to solve it, but we'll do what they ask us to do. Let me draw some axes over here. And I'll be in the first quadrant since we're dealing with earnings, so neither of their earnings can be negative. And let me just define the vertical axis as Abby's axis or the Abby's earnings axis. And let me define the horizontal axis as Ben's axis or Ben's earnings axis. And let me just graph each of these equations. And to do that, I'm going to take this first equation, and I'm going to put it in the equivalent of slope-intercept form. It might look a little unfamiliar to you, but it really is slope-intercept form. Let me rewrite it first. So we have A plus B is equal to 50. We can subtract B from both sides. So let's subtract B from both sides. And then we get A is equal to negative B plus 50. So if you think about it this way, when B is equal to 0, A is going to be 50. So we know our A intercept, we could call it. We normally would call that a y-intercept, but now this is the A axis. So this right here, let me call this 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. So if Ben made $0, then Abby would have to make $50 based on that first constraint. So we know that that's a point on the line right over there. And we also know that the slope is negative 1, that B is the independent variable, the way I've written it over here, and this coefficient is negative 1. Or another way to think about it is if A is 0, then B is going to be 50. If Abby made no money, then Ben would have to make $50. And that falls purely out of this equation right here. If Abby made nothing, then Ben would have to make $50, so 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. So those are those two situations and every point in between will satisfy this first constraint. So let me connect the dots. So it would look something like that. That's due to this first constraint, due to the fact that together they earned $50. Now, let's think about the second one. Abby earned $10 more than Ben. So that's this equation right here. And it's really already in our slope-intercept form. If Ben made $0, then Abby would make $10. So that's our A intercept. So it's right over there. We could keep doing that. Our slope is going to be 1 here. If Ben makes $10, then Abby's going to make $20. If Ben makes $20, Abby's going to make $30. We could keep going, but I think this gives us the general direction. It already hints at a point of intersection. So just eyeballing it, so we've graphed to the two constraints, together they earned $50. That's the magenta constraint right over here. Abby earned $10 more than Ben. That's this green constraint right over here. And it looks like we have a point of intersection. And it looks like we have a point of intersection at Ben earning $20. Let me label this as 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. So this is Ben earning $20 and Abby earning-- this is 10, 20, and 30. And Abby earning $30. So just eyeballing it off of this, it looks like A is 30 and B is 20. And let's go verify, make sure that these levels of earnings for Abby and Ben actually satisfy both constraints. So the first constraint is that Abby plus Ben have to make $50. Well, $30 plus $20 is $50. So it meets our first constraint. The second constraint is that Abby earned $10 more than Ben, that Abby is equal to Ben plus 10. Well, once again, over here, Abby is making $10 more than Ben. So it meets our second constraint. And we only have two of them. So it meets both of them. So that's our solution. Abby earned $30. Ben earned $20.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-systems-topic
" I've got pairs of mixed numbers and improper fractions, and I want to think about which of the two is larger. So 1 and 7/8, 39/10. So you could do this in your head. You could say 10 goes into 39, I'll even write it out, 10 goes into 39 3 times, 3 times 10. And you want to find the largest number of times 10 goes into this without going over. So you couldn't write a 4 over here, because then that would be 40. That would go over 39. 3 times 10 is 30. And then you have a remainder of 9. So you could rewrite this expression right over here. Instead of 39/10 you could write it as 30/10 plus 9/10. And 30/10 is just 3. So this is equal to 3 and 9/10. And you could do that in your head. You could say 10 goes into 39 3 times, and the remainder is 9. You have your 9/10. And that's essentially just doing this in your head. So now we can compare, and we can literally just look at the whole number parts. This is 1 and something, 1 and 7/8, and we're comparing it to essentially 3 and 9/10. 3 and 9/10 is clearly a larger number. We have a 3 out here instead of a 1, so we will write less than. And the way I always remember it is, the opening always faces the larger number. And the point is small. It always points to the smaller number. Now let's do this next one. 4 and 7/8 versus 49/9. So let's convert this to a mixed number. 9 goes into 49 5 times, and 5 times 9 is 45. So the remainder is going to be 4. The remainder is 4, so this is 5 and 4/9. Once again, we can literally just look at the whole number parts. 5 is clearly larger than 4, so once again, less than. Point facing the smaller number, opening facing the larger number. Now 2 and 1/2 versus 11/10. 10 goes into 11 only 1 time. And if you care about the remainder, it's 1. So it's 1 and 1/10. Which is clearly smaller than 2 and 1/2. You just look at the whole number parts. 2 is clearly larger than 1. So we want our opening of our less than or greater than sign to face the larger number. So we would write it like this. And this is greater than, so 2 and 1/2 is greater than 11/10. The little point facing the smaller number. 5 and 4/9 versus 40/7. 7 goes into 40, so let me rewrite this, 7 goes into 40 5 times. And then you're going to have a remainder of 5, because 7 times 5 is 35. You have a remainder of 5 to get to 40. So it's 5 and 5/7. And if that looks like I'm doing some type of voodoo, just remember, I'm really just breaking it up. I'm just really saying that 40/7 is the same thing as 35 plus 5/7. The largest multiple of 7 that is less than this number. And this is the same thing as 35/7 plus 5/7. And then this, 35/7 5. And 5/7 is just 5/7 there. This one is interesting because we have the same whole number out front on our mixed numbers. 5 versus 5. So now we actually do have to pay attention to the fractional part of our mixed number. We essentially have to compare 4/9 to 5/7. And there's a couple of ways to do this. You could get them to have the same denominator. That's probably the easiest way to do it. So you could rewrite-- so what's the least common multiple of 9 and 7? They share no factors, so really the least common multiple is going to be their product. So if we want to rewrite 4/9 we would write 63 in the denominator, that's 9 times 7. If we multiply the denominator by 7 we also have to multiply the numerator by 7. So that will be 28. Now 5/7, we're going to make the denominator 63. We're multiplying the denominator times 9. Then we have to multiply the numerator times 9 as well. 5 times 9 is 45. So here it's easy to see. 45/63 is clearly larger than 28/63. And so we could write this. And because the whole number of parts are the same, and 5/7 is the same thing as 45/63, and 4/9 is the same thing as 28/63, we can write that 5 and 4/9 is less than 40/7. Another way that you could have thought about 4/9 versus 5/7 is you could have said, well, how does 4/9 compare to 4/7? We have the same numerator. The denominator here is larger than the denominator here. But when you have a number in the denominator, the larger it is, the smaller the fraction. The smaller the absolute value of the fraction. So this right over here is a smaller quantity than 4/7. And 4/7 is clearly a smaller quantity than 5/7. So 4/9 is clearly smaller than 5/7, so we would have gotten the same result.",math_arithmetic_fraction-arithmetic
" -  I see a lot of mistakes when students draw resoce structures, and so I wanted to make a video on some of the more common mistakes that I've seen. So let's say we wanted to draw a resoce structure for this carbocation. Some students would take these electrons and move them down to here and say, all right, so on the right, now, I would have this, and this is my resoce structure. Let me highlight those electrons in blue here, so these electrons here move down to here. But this is incorrect, so let me write ""no"" here. So the resoce structure on the right, this is an incorrect resoce structure, why is this resoce structure not possible? Well, let's draw in the hydrogens on the carbons, and it will be much more obvious. So this carbon right here has one hydrogen on it, same with this carbon, and this carbon right here has two hydrogens on it, and the carbon with a plus one formal charge must have one hydrogen. So let's put in those hydrogens for the resoce structure on the right, and it should be obvious why this resoce structure is incorrect. Let's focus in on this carbon right here, the one I marked in red. How many bonds are there to that carbon? Well here's one bond, two, three, four, and five, that's five bonds to a carbon, that does not happen, you can't show carbon with five bonds, because that would be 10 electrons around this carbon, and carbon can never exceed an octet of electrons. Because of carbon's position on the periodic table, in the second period, there's four orbitals, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons, which gives us four times two, which is eight. So carbon can never exceed an octet. There's another reason why this is wrong. If we go to this top carbon here, there's only three bonds around that carbon, so that carbon would have a plus one formal charge. So we added another formal charge, and we have carbon with five bonds, so this is incorrect, this is not a correct resoce structure. So what is the proper resoce structure to draw? Well, let's show that down here. You take your electrons, and you move them in the direction of the positive charge, of the positive one formal charge, and so let's show that. The electrons in, let me make them blue again, the electrons in blue move over to here, like that. And that moves the positive formal charge over to this carbon. If we draw in our hydrogens, it'll be clear why this is correct. So we put in a hydrogen here, we put in a hydrogen here, and we put in a hydrogen here. So let me draw in those three hydrogens on the right. Okay, now it's very obvious, let me point this out in red. It's obvious that this carbon here in red has a plus one formal charge, it has three bonds around it. So one, two, and three. And this carbon, this carbon over here on the right that had the plus one formal charge, now its formal charge is zero, because there are four bonds around it. So one, two, three and four, so now the formal charge is zero. So this is the correct resoce structure. Now, it looks a little bit confusing when I have those hydrogens drawn in there, which is why we leave them off. Let me go ahead and draw it again on the right just for clarity. That's why we leave off those hydrogens when we\re drawing our resoce structures, because they get in the way, and once you understand what's going on it's not necessary to draw in those hydrogens. Let's do another example, and again, I'll start with the wrong way to do it, and then we'll talk about the correct way. So, a student might say, all right, I have a negative one formal charge on this nitrogen, so I could take this lone pair of electrons and move into here, which would push these electrons over to here, so let me go ahead and draw what some students might think is a correct resoce structure. So let me put in my lone pair of electrons, and let's follow some electrons along. So electrons in light blue on this nitrogen move into here, and electrons in, let's say dark blue, move down to here. And then finally, electrons in magenta remain behind on the nitrogen. So on the right, why is this not a correct resoce structure? So again, this is the wrong way to do it. Well, think about your hydrogens. So we'll start with this carbon right here, this carbon has one hydrogen, this carbon has one hydrogen, and this carbon down here has two. So if we put in those hydrogens over here on the right, hopefully it's obvious why this is incorrect. Let's look at this carbon down at the bottom of the ring, so this carbon right here I just marked in red. How many bonds do we have? Well, here's one, two, three, four, and five, so there are five bonds to that carbon, and we know carbon can never have five bonds. Carbon can never exceed an octet of electrons. So immediately we know that this is not a correct resoce structure. All right, let's talk about the right way to do it. So you take these electrons, and you move them into here, and then these (mumbles) electrons have to go somewhere, and they move out onto this carbon, so now, let's draw the correct other resoce structure here. So we'll put in our double bond, we'll put our electrons on this carbon, that gives this carbon a negative one formal charge, and then we have some electrons, a lone pair of electrons left on the nitrogen. I'll use the same colors as before, so these electrons right here in light blue move in to form our double bond. The electrons in dark blue move off onto this carbon, so the electrons in dark blue are on this carbon that I just marked in dark blue which gives that carbon a negative one formal charge. And the electrons in magenta remain behind on the nitrogen. All right, the reason why the carbon -- now I'll go ahead and mark it in a different color. This carbon I just marked in magenta has a negative one formal charge, is because, remember, there's one hydrogen on that carbon, so let me draw in that hydrogen over here. Let me see if I can squeeze it in over here like that. This carbon right here has three bonds to it and a lone pair of electrons, which gives that carbon in magenta a negative one formal charge. Now this nitrogen over here would have a formal charge equal to zero. And so this on the right, would be the correct resoce structure, and again, drawing in hydrogens is a waste of time, it gets in the way. Let me go ahead and draw the resoce structure again, I'll take out that hydrogen so it'll look cleaner, and it also takes less time when you're not drawing in all of your hydrogens. So you just put a lone pair of electrons and write a negative one formal charge, and you have to know that there's still a hydrogen on this carbon that I marked in magenta. So if you're having trouble drawing resoce structures, usually the problem is not thinking about your hydrogens, forgetting about putting in your hydrogens. And once you put those in, it's a lot easier to see if your dot structure, if your resoce structure, I should say, is correct, so be careful about that. And resoce structures are just practice. The more you draw, the better you're going to get and if you make a mistake, it's not a big deal. You learn from your mistake, and you keep on practicing.",science_organic-chemistry_organic-structures
" - What I want to do in this video is get some practice visualizing what happens if we were to try to rotate two dimensional shapes in three dimensions. Well what do I mean by that? Let's say I started with a right triangle. So let's say my right triangle looks like this. So let's say it looks like that. Right over there. And so this is a right angle. And let's say that this width right over here is three units and let's say that this length is five units and now I'm gonna do something interesting. I'm gonna take this two dimensional right triangle and I'm gonna try to rotate it in three dimensions around this line, around the line that I'm doing as a dotted magenta line. So I'm gonna rotate it around this line right over there. So if I were to rotate it around this line, what type of a shape am I going to get? And I encourage you -- It's going to be a three dimensional shape. I encourage you to think about it, maybe take out a piece of paper, draw it, or just try to imagine it in your head. Well to think about it in three dimensions, what I'm going to do is try to look at this thing in three dimensions. So let me draw this same line but I'm gonna draw it at an angle so we can visualize the whole thing in three dimensions. So imagine if this was sitting on the ground. So that's our magenta line, and then I can draw my triangle. So my triangle would look something like this. So it would look like this. So once again this is five units, this is three units, this a right triangle. I'm gonna rotate it around the line, so what's it gonna look like? Well this and this right over here is gonna rotate around and it's gonna form a circle with a radius of three, right? So it's gonna form, so it intersects, if that was on the ground it's gonna be three again. And let me draw it down so it's gonna keep going down. Whoops. We don't want to press the wrong button. So it's gonna look something like this. That's what the base is gonna look like. But then this end right over here is just gonna stay at a point because this is right on that magenta line. So it's gonna stay at a point. And so if you were to look at the intersect so it would look something like this. So it would look like this and then you'd have another thing that goes like this and so if you were to take a section like this it would have a little smaller circle here based on what this distance is. So what is the shape, what is the shape that I am drawing? Well what you see, what it is, it's a cone. It's a cone and if I shade it in you might see the cone a little bit better. So let me shade it in so you see the cone. So what you end up getting is a cone where it's base, so I'm shading it in so that hopefully helps a little bit, so what you end up getting is a cone where the base has a radius of three units. So let me draw this. This right over here is the radius of the base and it is three units. I could also draw it like this. So the cone is gonna look like this. And this is the tip of the cone and it's gonna look just like this. And once again let me shade it a little bit so that you can appreciate that this is a three dimensional shape. So draw the cone so you can shade it and we can even construct the original so that, well or we can construct the original shape so you see how it constructs so it makes this, the line, that magenta line, is gonna do this type of thing. It's gonna go through the center of the base, it's gonna go through the center of the base just like that. And our original shape, our original right triangle, if you just took a cross section of it that included that line you would have your original shape. Let me do this in orange. So the original shape is right over there. So what do you get? You get a cone where the radius of the base is three units. Interesting.",math_math2_solids
" -  We are asked what is the value of the 100th term in this sequence, and the first term is 15, then nine, then three, then negative three. So let's write it like this in a table. So if we have the term, just so we have things straight, and then we have the value, and then we have the value of the term. I'll do a nice little table here. So our first term we saw is 15. Our second term is nine. Our third term is three. I'm just really copying this down, but I'm making sure we associate it with the right term. And then our fourth term, our fourth term is negative three. And they wanna ask, they want us to figure out what the 100th term of this sequence is going to be. So let's see what's happening here, if we can discern some type of pattern. So we went from the first term to the second term, what happened? 15 to nine, looks like we went down by six. It's always good to think about just how much the numbers changed by. That's always the simplest type of pattern. So we went down by six, we subtracted six. Then to go from nine to three, well we subtracted six again. We subtracted six again. And then to go from three to negative three, well we, we subtracted six again. We subtracted six again. So it looks like every term, you subtract six. So the second term is going to be six less than the first term. The third term is going to be 12 minus from the first term, or six subtracted twice. So in the third term, you subtract a six twice. In the fourth term, you subtract six three times. So whatever term you're looking at, you subtract six one less than that many times. Let me write this down just so, notice when your first term, you have 15 and you don't subtract six at all, or you could say you subtract six zero times. So you could say this is 15 minus six times or let me write it better this way, minus zero times six. That's what that first term is right there. What's the second term? This is 15, it's just we just subtracted six once, or you could say minus one times six. Or you could say plus one times negative six, either way, we're subtracting the six once. Now what's happening here? This is 15, this is 15 minus two times negative six, or sorry minus two times six, minus two times six. We're subtracting a six twice. What's the fourth term? This is 15 minus, we're subtracting the six three times from the 15, so minus three times six. So if you see the pattern here, when our term, when we have our fourth term, we have the term minus one right there, the fourth term we have a three, the third term we have a two, the second term we have a one. So if we had the nth term, if we just had the nth term here, what's this going to be? It's going to be 15 minus, you see it's going to be n minus one right here, right when n is four, n minus one is three. When n is three, n minus one is two. When n is two, n minus one is one. When n is one, n minus one is zero. So we're going to have, this term right here is n minus one, so minus n minus one times six. So if you wanna figure out the 100th term of this sequence, I didn't even have to write it in this general term, you could just look at this pattern. It's going to be, and I'll do it in pink, the 100th term in our sequence, I'll continue our table down, is gonna be what? It's going to be 15 minus 100 minus one, which is 99, times six, right? I just followed the pattern. One, you had a zero here, two, you had a one here, three, you had a two here, 100, you're gonna have a 99 here. So let's just calculate what this is. What's 99 times six? So 99 times six, actually you could do this in your head. You could say that's going to be six less than 100 times six, which is 600, and six less is 594. But if you didn't wanna do it that way, you just do it the old-fashioned way. Six times nine is 54, carry the five. Nine times six or six times nine is 54. 54 plus five is 594. So this right here is 594, and then to figure out what 15, so we wanna figure out, we wanna figure out what 15 minus 594 is, and this can sometimes be confusing, but the way I always process this in my head is I say that this is the exact same thing as the negative of 594 minus 15. And if you don't believe me, distribute out this negative sign. Negative one times 594 is negative 594, negative one times negative 15 is positive 15. So these two statements are equivalent. This is much easier for my brain to understand. So what's 594 minus 15? You should do it, we could do this in our head. 594 minus 14 would be 580, and then 580 minus one more would be 579. So that right there is 579, and then we have this negative sign sitting out there. So our the 100th term in our sequence will be negative 579.",math_engageny-alg-1_alg1-3
" Find the sum 15 plus negative 46 plus 29. Let's just think about this first part over here where we have 15 plus negative 46. And we'll worry about the plus 29 later on. So let's just do 15-- let me do that in a different color-- plus negative 46. I'll do it in that orange. Let me draw a number line here, just so we can properly visualize what is going on. That's my number line. And we're starting at 15. So let's draw a 0 over here. And so we're starting at 15. 15 could be right over here. So this is 15. Let me draw a big fat arrow to signify this is 15. 15 has an absolute value of 15, so the length of this arrow would be 15. Now we're adding negative 46 to that 15. This is equivalent to 15 minus 46, which means we are going to move 46 spots to the left of 15. A negative sign or a minus means we're moving to the left on the number line. So we're going to move 46 to the left. We're starting at 15, and we are going to move 46 to the left. So the length of this arrow right here is going to be 46, and we're moving to the left. This is the negative 46 that we're adding to the 15. We're going to end up at some point over here. That point is clearly 0. Because we were 15 to the right. Now we're going to move 46 to the left. So we're definitely going to be to the left of 0. It's definitely going to be a negative number. And we can even think about the absolute value of that negative number. We can just visualize it. This yellow arrow has a length of 15. This orange arrow has a length of 46. The blue arrow that I'm about to draw, which is the sum of these two, is going to have this length right over here. And just visually, how can we figure out the length of this blue part if we know the length of this orange part and we know the length of this yellow part? Well, it's just going to be the difference. It's just going to be the difference of these two. So the absolute value of the sum is going to be the difference between this length, 46, and 15. Let me just figure that out, 46 minus 15. 6 minus 5 is 1. 4 minus 1 is 3. So the length of this is going to be 31, and it's going to be 31 to the left of 0. So this is going to be negative 31 right over here. We know that this first part over here is negative 31, and then to that we are going to add 29. So we're going to add 29. Let me do that in another color. What does that mean? That means that we're going to start at negative 31, and we're going to move 29 to the right. We're adding 29, so we're going to move 29 to the right. So maybe that gets us right about there. I'm trying to draw an arrow of length 29. I can draw a cleaner looking arrow than that. I'll do it right over here, actually. So then we're going to move 29 over to the right. That's the 29 part. Now this is a positive 29, and so how do we figure out what this is? This is 29 right here that we're adding. This is going to land us right over here on the number line. So how do we figure out what number that is? Well, once again, we can just visualize it. And eventually you won't have to draw number lines and stuff, but I think it'll be useful here. We're starting at negative 31. We're adding 29 to it, so it's going to make it less negative. But we're still adding less than 31, so we're not going to get all the way back to 0. We're still going to have a negative number. But how could we figure out the absolute value of that negative number, its distance? Well, once again, that little white part right there, that white part plus this 29, is going to equal 31, if you just think of absolute value, if we don't think about the signs, if we just think about the length. Or another way to think about it, 31 minus 29 will give us the length of that white part. And of course, it's going to be negative, because the negative number here is larger than the positive number. And we're adding the 2. If we do 31 minus 29, you could borrow and all of that, but that's clearly just going to be equal to 2. You could say that's 11. This is a 2. You subtract, this is equal to 2. But since it's negative 31 plus 29, it's going to be a negative 2. We're still going to stay negative. We haven't moved far to the right enough to pass 0. So this right here is going to be negative 2. Or another way to think about it, the length of this white bar, the absolute value, is going to be 2. 2 plus 29 is 31. But we're operating to the left of 0, so it's negative 31. This is negative 2. Anyway, hopefully you found that useful. And let me make it clear. Our final answer is negative 2.",math_arithmetic_arith-review-negative-numbers
" - Hello, your Majesty, what can I help you with? Oh Sal, I have such an emergency. I have commissioned a gold statue of my father's head, and I'm not sure if it's the right size. Oh, well what is the right size? Well as you know, in our kingdom we have a tradition of measuring things in terms of blue fuzzy squares. Yep, I'm aware of that. I also like to measure things in terms of blue fuzzy squares. And by law, all gold statues in our kingdom have to be exactly four blue fuzzy squares tall. Okay, that seems like a reasonable law. So what's the issue? Well I'm not sure if this statue is four blue fuzzy squares tall. Well okay, let's calm down. I think we can work through this. I have a bunch of blue fuzzy squares here. Why don't we put them next to the statue and see if we are exactly four blue fuzzy squares tall. Oh, that would be just wonderful. Here you go, here you go, your Highness. Why don't you stack them up? Oh so let me do this, okay. So that's one, two, and three blue fuzz-- Oh my God, this is an emergency! This is only three blue fuzzy squares tall! It is not tall enough! Oh no, what am I going to do? Oh wait, hold on, hold on. I don't think you have to panic just yet because when I look at how you stacked them up, and it's actually quite amazing because you somehow made these blue fuzzy squares levitate. Oh, of course, all blue fuzzy squares need to levitate. Okay, well yeah, that's neat. But if you really wanted to measure, you need to make sure that you don't have any gaps over here. So why don't you try again? So let's take these blue fuzzy squares out, and why don't you try to measure again. Oh, okay, now that makes all the sense in the world. Okay, so let me try again. So that's one, two, notice I'm not letting them, no gaps here. Yep, yep, okay, although it's already, well-- Well let me keep going Sal, stop interrupting me. Okay, okay, keep going, your Highness. Three, four, and five. Oh no, oh no, no, no, this is all wrong! It's going to be a disaster! It needs to be four, not five blue fuzzy squares tall! Wait, wait, your Highness, don't panic yet. I don't think this is quite right because you didn't start at the bottom of the statue, you started below the bottom of the statue, and you didn't end at the top of the statue, you ended above the top of the statue. So it isn't five blue fuzzy squares tall. Oh Sal, I'm just so confused. Can you just do it for me? Well I think it's better if you do it yourself. Just keep it in mind, start measuring at the bottom of the statue, and stop measuring at the top of the statue. Just make sure that you don't have any spaces in between. Okay, I'm getting tired, but I'll give it one last try. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. It's always about making a good effort on things. Okay, here I go. This is the bottom, so I'll start stacking there. This is the top, so I will stop stacking there. Okay, one, two, and I don't want any gaps, so two, three, and four. Oh, it actually looks just about right. It looks just about right. We are exactly four blue fuzzy squares tall. Oh this is just going to be a wonderful addition to the palace. Thank you so much.

" A local hospital is holding a raffle as a fundraiser. The individual cost of participating in the raffle is given by the following expression-- 5t plus 3, or 5 times t plus 3, where t represents the number of tickets someone purchases. Evaluate the expression when t is equal to 1, t is equal to 8, and t is equal to 10. So let's first take the situation where t is equal to 1. Then this expression right over here becomes-- and I'll use that same color-- becomes 5 times 1. 5 times 1 plus 3. 5 times 1 plus 3, and we know from order of operations, you do the multiplication before you do the addition. So this will be 5 times 1 is 5 plus 3, and then this is clearly equal to 8. Now let's do it when t is equal to 8. So when t is equal to 8, this expression becomes-- and I'll do the same colors again-- 5 times 8 plus 3. Same color of green. And once again, 5 times 8 is 40, and then we have the plus 3, there so this is equal to 43. And so we have the last situation, with t is equal to 10. I'll do that in blue. So we have 5 times 10. So 5t is 5 times 10. Instead of a t, put a 10 there. 5 times 10 plus 3. That's a slightly different shade of green, but I think you get the idea. 5 times 10 is 50. We do 50, and then we're going to have to add 3 to that, and that is equal to 53. And we're done.",math_algebra_foundation-algebra
" -  So we have an infinite series here, one plus one over two to the fifth, plus one over three to the fifth, and we just keep on going forever. We could write this as the sum from n equals one to infinity of one over n to the fifth power, one over n to the fifth power. And now you might recognize, notice, when n is equal to one, this is one over one to the fifth, that's that over there, and we could keep on going. Now you might immediately recognize this as a p-series, and a p-series has the general form of the sum, going from n equals one to infinity, of one over n to the p, where p is a positive value. So in this particular case, our p, for this p-series, is equal to five. P is equal to five. Now you might already recognize, under which conditions for a p-series does it converge or diverge? It's going to converge. It's going to converge when your p is greater than one, which is clearly the case in this scenario right over here. Our p is clearly greater than one. We would diverge, we would diverge if our p is greater than zero and less than or equal, or less than or equal to one. This would be a divergent. So if this was like .9 here, or if this was a, you know, 3/4, then we would be diverging. So at least for this one, we are convergent. Let's do another one of these. All right. So here, you might again recognize this as a p-series. Let me rewrite this infinite sum. So this is the sum from n equals one to infinity of one over, let's see, we have a square root of two, a square root of three. So you could do this as two to the 1/2, three to the 1/2, four to the 1/2. So it's one over n to the 1/2. Notice, this is when n is equal to one. One over one to the 1/2 is one. One over two to the 1/2, well, that's this right over here. And we keep on going on and on and on. Well, in this case, we still have a p-series. We have one over n to some power, and that power is positive. But notice, in this case, our p falls between zero and one. So 1/2 is our p. So p for our p-series is equal to 1/2, and that's between zero and one. Remember, we're divergent, divergent, when our p is greater than zero and less than or equal to one, which was clearly the case right over here. So this is going to be divergent.",math_integral-calculus_ic-series
" P is the center of the green arc. So this is p right over here. The measure of angle P is 0.4 radians, and the length of the radius is 5 units. That's this length right over here. Find the length of the green arc. So just to kind of conceptualize this a little bit, P, you can imagine, is the center of this larger circle. And this angle right over here that has a measure of 0.4 radians, it intercepts this green arc right over here. In order to figure this out-- and actually, I encourage you to pause this video now and try to think about this question on your own. How long is this arc, given the information that they've given us? Well, all we have to do is remind ourselves what a radian is. One way to think about a radian is if you look at the arc that the angle intercepts, which is this green arc, if you think about its length, the length of this green arc is going to be 0.4 radii. One way to think about radians is if this angle is 0.4 radians, that means that the arc that it intercepts is going to be 0.4 radii long. So this length we could write as 0.4 radii. Or ""radiuses,"" but ""radii"" is the proper term. Now, we don't want our length in terms of radii. We want our length in terms of whatever units the radius is, these kind of 5 units. Well, we know that each radius has a length of 5, that our radius of the circle has a length of 5. So this is going to be 0.4 radii times 5-- and you know they just call it units right over here. I'll put it in quotes because it's kind of a generic term-- 5 units per radii. So the radii cancel out. We're left with just the units, which is what we want. So 0.4 times 5 is 2. So this is going to be equal to 2. So just as a refresher again, when the angle measure in radians, one way to think about it is the arc that it intercepts, that's going to be this many radii long. Well, if each radius is 5 units, it's going to be 0.4 times 5 units long, or 2.",math_engageny-geo_geo-5
" Let's see if we can take the derivative with respect to x of 2 to the x power. And you might say, hold on a second. We know how to take the derivative of e to the x. But what about a base like 2? We don't know what to do with 2. And the key here is to rewrite 2 to the x so that we essentially have it as e to some power. And the key there is to rewrite 2. So how can we rewrite 2 so it is e to some power? Well, let's think about what e to the natural log of 2 power is. The natural log of 2 is the power that I would have to raise e to to get to 2. So if we actually raise e to that power, we are going to get to 2. So what we could do, instead of writing 2 to the x, we could rewrite this as e. We could rewrite 2 as e to the natural log of 2, and then raise that to the x power. So this is the x power in yellow. And so let's do that right over here. So instead of taking the derivative with respect to x of 2 to the x, let's say, let's just take the derivative with respect to x of the exact same expression rewritten, of e to the natural log of 2 raised to the x power. Let me put this x in that same color, dx. Now we know from our exponent properties if we raise something to some power, and then raise that to another power, we can take the product of the two powers. Let me rewrite this just to remember. If I have a to b, and then I raise that to the c power, this is the exact same thing as a to the b times c power. So we can utilize that exponent property right here to rewrite this as being equal to the derivative with respect to x of e to the natural log of 2 times x. And what's neat about this is now we've got this into a form of e to the something. So we can essentially use the chain rule to evaluate this. So this derivative is going to be equal to the derivative of e to the something with respect to that something. Well, the derivative e to the something with respect to that something is just e to that something. So it's going to be equal to e to the natural log of 2 times x. So let me make it clear what I just did here. This right over here is the derivative of e to the natural log of 2 times x with respect to the natural log of 2-- let me make it a little bit clearer-- with respect to the natural log of 2 times x. So we took the derivative of e to the something with respect to that something-- that's this right here, it's just e to that something. And then we're going to multiply that by, this is just an application of the chain rule, of the derivative of that something with respect to x. So the derivative of natural log of 2 times x with respect to x is just going to be natural log of 2. This is just going to be natural log of 2. The derivative of a times x is just going to be equal to a. This is just the coefficient on the x. And just to be clear, this is the derivative of natural log of 2 times x with respect to x. So we're essentially done. But we can simplify this even further. This thing right over here can be rewritten. And let me draw a line here just to make it clear that this equals sign is a continuation from what we did up there. But this e to the natural log of 2x, we can rewrite that, using this exact same exponent property, as e to the natural log of 2, and then all of that raised to the x power. And of course, we're multiplying it times the natural log of 2, so times the natural log of 2. Well, what is e to the natural log of 2? Well, we already figured that out. That is exactly equal to 2. This right over here is equal to 2. And so now we can simplify. This whole thing, the derivative of 2 to the x, is equal to-- and I'll switch the order a little bit-- it is the natural log of 2, that's this part right over here, times 2 to the x. Or we could write it as 2 to the x times the natural log of 2.",math_calculus-all-old_taking-derivatives-calc
" To which intervals could we restrict f of x is equal to cosine of x minus pi over four, so that f of x is invertible? And they show us what cosine of x minus pi over four, what it looks like, the graph of it. So lets just think about what it means for a function to be invertible. A function is a mapping from a set of elements that we would call the domain, so let me, my pen is a little off today so lets see if it works ok. So this right here is our domain. And this over here is our range. And a function maps from an element in our domain, to an element in our range. That's what a function does. Now the inverse of the function maps from that element in the range to the element in the domain. So that over there would be f inverse. If that's the direction of the function, that's the direction of f inverse. Now, a function is not invertible, one of the situations in which a function is not invertible you could have a function where two elements of the domain map to the same element of the range. So both of these elements map to that element of the range, so both of these are the function, but then, if this is the case, you're not going to be able to create a function that maps the other way, because if you input this into the inverse function, where do you go? Do you go to that element of the domain? Or do you go to that element right over there? So one way to think about it is, you need a one to one mapping. For each element of the range, there's only one element of the domain that gets you there. Or another way to think about it, you could try to draw a horizontal line on the graph of the function and see if it crosses through the function more than once. And you could see that this is indeed the case for this function right over here. If I did a horizontal line, right over here. Now why is this the issue? Well this is showing, actually let me show a number that's a little bit easier to look at. So lets say I drew the horizontal line right over here. Now why is this horizontal line an issue? Well, showing us the part of the domain that's being graphed here, that there's several points that map to the same element of the range. They're mapping to 0.5. 0.5, this value right over here. When you take f of that is equal to 0.5, f of this is equal to 0.5, f of this right over here is 0.5. So if you have multiple elements of your domain mapping to the same element of the range, then the function will not be invertible for that domain. So really what we're going to do is, we're going to try to restrict the domain so that, for that domain, if I were to essentially apply this, what I call the horizontal line test, I'd only intersect the function once. So lets look at the graph of the function once. So lets look at these choices. So the first one is an open set from -5 pi over four. -5 pi over four, so that's pi, that's negative pi, and another fourth of pi. So that's, I think, starting right over here, going all the way to negative 1/4th pi. So that's this domain right over here. Let me do this in a new color. So that's this, and this does not include the two endpoints. So here I can still apply the horizontal line and, in that domain, I can show that there's two members of the domain that are mapping to the same element in the range, and so if I'm trying to construct the inverse of that, what would this element, which I guess is -0.6, what would that f inverse of -0.6 be? Would it be this value here? Or would it be this value here? I would rule this one out. Let's see, negative pi to pi. I'll do this in this color right over here. Negative pi to pi. This is a fairly, so once again, this is enclosed, so we're including the two boundaries, we're including negative pi and pi in the domain. But once again over that interval, I could apply my horizontal line here and notice, or actually I could even apply the original one that I did in blue, and notice there's multiple elements of the domain that map to, say 0.5. So what would f inverse of 0.5 be? You can't construct a function where it maps only to one element of the domain, so we could rule this one out right as well. Now, negative 1/2 pi to positive 1/2 pi. So negative 1/2 pi, so let me, I'm running out of colors. So negative 1/2 pi to positive 1/2 pi, This one is interesting, if I apply a horizontal line there, there, there, so lets see, but if I apply a horizontal line right over here I do intersect the function twice, so I have two members of this domain mapping to the same element of the range, so I can rule that one out as well. And I'm left with one last choice. I'm hoping this one will work out. So 1/2 pi, it's an open set, so 1/2 pi, right over there, to five pi over four. So that's pi and another 1/4th, so that's right over there. And lets see, this is, if I were to look at the graph here, it seems like it would pass the horizontal line test. At any point here I could make a horizontal line over that domain. Actually, let me do it for the whole domain. So you see that. For the whole domain. And I'm only intersecting the function once. So, for every element of the range that we're mapping to, there's only one element in our domain that is mapping to it. It's passing our horizontal line test, so I would check this one right over there.",math_engageny-precalc_precalc-3
" -  We've already looked at several ways of writing linear equations. You could write it in slope-intercept form, where it would be of the form of Y is equal to MX plus B, where M and B are constants. M is the coefficient on this MX term right over here and M would represent the slope. And then from B you're able to figure out the y-intercept. The Y, you're able to figure out the y-intercept from this. Literally the graph that represents the XY pairs that satisfy this equation, it would intersect the y-axis at the point X equals zero, Y is equal to B. And it's slope would be M. We've already seen that multiple times. We've also seen that you can also express things in point-slope form. So let me make it clear. This is slope-intercept. Slope- intercept. And these are just different ways of writing the same equations. You can algebraically manipulate from one to the other. Another way is point-slope. Point-slope form. And in point-slope form, if you know that some, if you know that there's an equation where the line that represents the solutions of that equation has a slope M. Slope is equal to M. And if you know that X equals, X equals A, Y equals B, satisfies that equation, then in point-slope form you can express the equation as Y minus B is equal to M times X minus A. This is point-slope form and we do videos on that. But what I really want to get into in this video is another form. And it's a form that you might have already seen. And that is standard form. Standard. Standard form. And standard form takes the shape of AX plus BY is equal to C, where A, B, and C are integers. And what I want to do in this video, like we've done in the ones on point-slope and slope-intercept is get an appreciation for what is standard form good at and what is standard form less good at? So let's give a tangible example here. So let's say I have the linear equation, it's in standard form, 9X plus 16Y is equal to 72. And we wanted to graph this. So the thing that standard form is really good for is figuring out, not just the y-intercept, y-intercept is pretty good if you're using slope-intercept form, but we can find out the y-intercept pretty clearly from standard form and the x-intercept. The x-intercept isn't so easy to figure out from these other forms right over here. So how do we do that? Well to figure out the x and y-intercepts, let's just set up a little table here, X comma Y, and so the x-intercept is going to happen when Y is equal to zero. And the y-intercept is going to happen when X is equal to zero. So when Y is zero, what is X? So when Y is zero, 16 times zero is zero, that term disappears, and you're left with 9X is equal to 72. So if nine times X is 72, 72 divided by nine is eight. So X would be equal to eight. So once again, that was pretty easy to figure out. This term goes away and you just have to say hey, nine times X is 72, X would be eight. When Y is equal to zero, X is eight. So the point, let's see, Y is zero, X is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. That's this point, that right over here. This point right over here is the x-intercept. When we talk about x-intercepts we're referring to the point where the line actually intersects the x-axis. Now what about the y-intercept? Well, we said X equals zero, this disappears. And we're left with 16Y is equal to 72. And so we could solve, we could solve that. So we could say, alright 16Y is equal to 72. And then divide both sides by 16. We get Y is equal to 72 over 16. And let's see, what is that equal to? That is equal to, let's see, they're both divisible by eight, so that's nine over two. Or we could say it's 4.5. So when X is zero, Y is 4.5. And so, we could plot that point as well. X is zero, Y is one, two, three, 4.5. And just with these two points, two points are enough to graph a line, we can now graph it. So let's do that. So let me, oops, though I was using the tool that would draw a straight line. Let me see if I can... So the line will look something like that. There you have it. I've just graphed, I've just graphed, this is the line that represents all the X and Y pairs that satisfy the equation 9X plus 16Y is equal to 72. Now, I mentioned standard form's good at certain things and the good thing that standard form is, where it's maybe somewhat unique relative to the other forms we looked at, is it's very easy to figure out the x-intercept. It was very easy to figure out the x-intercept from standard form. And it wasn't too hard to figure out the y-intercept either. If we looked at slope-intercept form, the y-intercept just kinda jumps out at you. At point-slope form, neither the x nor the y-intercept kind of jump out at you. The place where slope-intercept or point-slope form are frankly better is that it's pretty easy to pick out the slope here, while in standard form you would have to do a little bit of work. You could use these two points, you could use the x and y-intercepts as two points and figure out the slope from there. So you can literally say, ""Okay, if I'm going from ""this point to this point, my change in X ""to go from eight to zero is negative eight. ""And to go from zero to 4.5,"" I wrote that little delta there unnecessarily. Let me. So when you go from eight to zero, your change in X is equal to negative eight. And to go from zero to 4.5, your change in Y is going to be 4.5. So your slope, once you've figured this out, you could say, ""Okay, this is going to be ""change in Y, 4.5, over change in X, ""over negative 8."" And since I, at least I don't like a decimal up here, let's multiply the numerator and the denominator by two. You get negative nine over 16. Now once again, we had to do a little bit of work here. We either use these two points, it didn't just jump immediately out of this, although you might see a little bit of a pattern of what's going on here. But you still have to think about is it negative? Is it positive? You have to do a little bit of algebraic manipulation. Or, what I typically do if I'm looking for the slope, I actually might put this into, into one of the other forms. Especially slope-intercept form. But standard form by itself, great for figuring out both the x and y-intercepts and it's frankly not that hard to convert it to slope-intercept form. Let's do that just to make it clear. So if you start with 9X, let me do that in yellow. If we start with 9X plus 16Y is equal to 72 and we want to put it in slope-intercept form, we can subtract 9X from both sides. You get 16Y is equal to negative 9X, plus 72. And then divide both sides by 16. So divide everthing by 16. And you'll be left with Y is equal to negative 9/16X, that's the slope, you see it right there, plus 72 over 16, we already figured out that's 9/2 or 4.5. So I could write, oh I'll just write that as 4.5. And this form over here, much easier to figure out the slope and, actually, the y-intercept jumps out at you. But the x-intercept isn't as obvious.",math_algebra_forms-of-linear-equations
" All of the reactions we've looked at so far have been of the form lowercase a moles of the molecule uppercase A, plus lowercase b moles of a molecule uppercase B. They react to form the product or the products. Let's just say they have a couple of products. I could have had as many molecules here as I wanted. Let's say c moles of the molecule C plus d moles of the molecule capital D. And the idea here is that they went in one direction. And if we did a little energy diagram, just going off of the kinematics video we just did, if that's the reaction, or how the reaction progresses, you could imagine that here you have it at a higher energy state. You have lowercase a moles of capital A molecule, plus lowercase b moles of capital B molecule, and you have some activation energy. And then you get to a more stable state or a lower energy level here, where it's lowercase c moles of C molecule plus lowercase d moles of the D moles, and of course, you had some activation energy. It only goes in this direction. Once you get here, it's very hard to go back. So that if you came back and looked at this-- if you get enough of A and B-- you'll just be sitting with molecules of C and D. It'll only go in this direction. But that's not how it happens in reality. In reality-- well, it sometimes happens like this in reality where the reaction can only go in one direction. But in a lot of cases, the reaction can actually go in both directions. So we could write, instead of this one-way reaction, we could write a two-way reaction like this. And not to confuse you too much, these are the number of moles or the ratios of the molecules I'm adding up, and they become relevant in a second. So let's say I have lowercase a moles of this molecule plus lowercase b moles of this molecule, and then they react to form lowercase c moles of this molecule plus lowercase d moles of that molecule. Sometimes the reaction can go in both directions. And to do that, to just show an equilibrium reaction, you do these arrows that go in both directions. That means that, hey, some of this is going to start forming into some of this. But at the same time, some of this might start forming into some of this. And at some point, I'm going to be reaching an equilibrium. When the rate of reaction of molecules going in that direction is equal to the number of molecules going in the other direction, then I'm going to reach some type of equilibrium. Now, why would this happen as opposed to that? And I can think of one situation. If we draw this energy diagram again. Maybe both of these have similar or not so different energy states. There could be other reasons, but this is the one that comes to my mind. Maybe the energy states look something like this. On this side, you have the A plus B, and then you need some activation energy. And then maybe the C plus D, maybe it's a little bit of a lower potential, but it's not that much lower. So maybe they're favored to go in this direction, because this is a more stable state. So this is the A plus B, but here you have the C plus D. But it's not ridiculous to go this way either. So most of it might go that way, but some of it might go this way. If some of these molecules just have the right amount of kinetic energy, they can surmount this activation energy and then go backwards to that side of it. And the study of this is called equilibrium, where you're looking at the concentrations of the different molecules. And just to compare that to kinetics, kinetics was how fast is this is going to happen? Or what can I do to change the activation, this hump here? Equilibrium is studying what will be the concentrations of the different molecules that end up, once the rate going in this direction is equal to the rate going in that direction. And I want to be clear. Equilibrium is where the rate going in the forward direction is equal to the rate going in the reverse direction. It doesn't mean that the concentrations of the two things are equal. You might end up with 25% of your eventual solution's concentration to be A and B and 75% here. All we know is that at some point, you've reached an-- equilibrium just means that those concentrations won't change anymore. And just to give you an example what I mean here, I could have written-- let's see, this is actually the Haber process. I could write nitrogen gas plus 3 hydrogen gases. These are all in gas form, so I can put a little g in parentheses. Actually, it's an equilibrium reaction, and it produces 2 moles of ammonia. It's called the Haber process. We could talk about that in another video. So in this case, we could say a is just 1, this lowercase a. Capital A is the nitrogen molecule. Lowercase b is 3. Uppercase B is the hydrogen molecule. And then lowercase c is the number of moles of ammonia and uppercase C is the ammonia molecule itself. I just want you to realize this is just an abstract way of describing a whole set of equations. Now, what's interesting in equilibrium reactions is that you can define a constant called the equilibrium constant. It's defined as the constant of equilibrium. Let me switch colors. I'm using this light blue too much. The equilibrium constant is defined as you take the products, or the right-hand side-- but if it goes in both directions, you can obviously go in either direction. But let's say that this is the forward direction going from A plus B to C plus D. So you take the products, you take the concentration of each of the products, and you multiply them by each other, and you raise them to the mole ratios that you're taking. So in this case, it would be the concentration of big C raised to the lowercase c power and the concentration of big D raised to the lowercase d power. And when I say concentration, they usually-- especially what you see in your intro chemistry classes, the concentration is going to be measured in molarity, which, just as a review, is moles per liter. A couple of videos ago, when I taught you what molarity was, I said, you know, moles per liter--- I don't like it so much because the volume of your fluid or your gas you're dealing with is dependent on temperature. So I didn't like using molarity. But in this case, it's kind of OK. Because this equilibrium constant is also only true for a given temperature. We assume it for a given temperature, and I'll show you how we use it in a second. But it's defined as the concentrations of the products to the powers. And also, if I have time, maybe I'll do it in the next video. The intuition why you're raising it to the power divided by the concentrations of the reactants, or the things on the left-hand side of the equilibrium reaction. So capital A to the lowercase a divided by capital B to the lowercase B. And what's interesting about this, and this is a bit of a simplification, because this doesn't apply to all reactions. But to most things that you're going to encounter in an intro chemistry class, this is true, that once you establish this equilibrium constant for a certain temperature-- it's only true for a certain temperature-- then you can change the concentrations and then be able to predict what the resulting concentrations are going to be. Let me give you an example. So let's say that after you did this equilibrium reaction-- and actually, just to make things hit home a little bit, let me take this Haber process reaction and write it in the same form. So if I wanted to write the equilibrium constant for the Haber reaction, or if I wanted to calculate it, I would let this reaction go at some temperature. So this is only true at-- let's say we're doing it at 25 Celsius, which is roughly room temperature. So what I would do is I would take the products. So the only product is ammonia, NH3. I raise it to the power of the number of moles that's produced for every 1 mole of nitrogen gas and 3 moles of hydrogen. So I raise it to the power of 2. So that's what that gets me. And I divide it by the reactants. So 1 mole of nitrogen, so I would just put the concentration of the nitrogen, plus 3 moles of hydrogen-- oh, no, no. I shouldn't write a plus there. It's multiplied. So times the hydrogen, and I raise it to the third power, because for every 1 mole of nitrogen, I have 3 moles of hydrogen and then 2 moles of ammonia. And if I were to calculate this, remember, when I put these in brackets, I'm figuring out the concentration. So I would have to figure out the moles per liter. Or sometimes they say, the molarity of each of these things, and it'll get me some constant. If I change it, I can go and calculate the rest, so let me just do an example right now. So let's say I have 1 mole of molecule A plus 2 moles of molecule B are in equilibrium with 3 moles of molecule C. And let's say that once we're in equilibrium, we go and we measure the concentrations, and we figure out that the concentration of A is 1 molar, which is equal to 1 mole per liter. That's the concentration of A. 1We figure out that once we're in equilibrium, the 1concentration of B is equal to 3 molar, which 1means 3 moles per liter. 1And let's say that once we're in that equilibrium, the 1concentration of C is equal to point-- well, I don't want to 1do something too-- let's say it's equal to 1 molar as well. 1I should get rid of that point there, because I don't want to 1say 0.1 molar, so it's just 1 molar. 1So if we wanted to calculate the equilibrium constant for 1this reaction, we just take C, the concentration of C over 1here, so let's see. 1The equilibrium constant is equal to the concentration of 1C to the third power divided by the concentration of A to 1the first power-- because there's only 1 mole of A for 1every 3 of C and 2 of B-- times the concentration of-- 1I'll do it in that color-- B to the third power. 1So if we needed to calculate this, concentration of C is 1 1molar, and we're raising it to the third power, divided by 1concentration of A is 1 molar times the concentration of B, 1which is 3 molars, to the third power. 1So this is equal to 1/27. 1There's a couple of things we can think about. 1The fact that this is less than 1, what does that mean? 1Well, that means that our concentration of our reactants 1is much larger than the concentration of the products, 1where we view just the products as whatever's on the 1right-hand side of the equation. 1So once this reaction goes to equilibrium, we're still left 1with a lot more of this than this. 1And because we're left with a lot more of that, our 1equilibrium constant is less than 1, which means that the 1reaction favors this direction. 1It favors the backward direction. 1Think about it. 1Because there's more of this, this must be happening more 1than the left-to-right reaction. 1The left to right might be a small direction like this, 1while more is happening there, and that's why we're finding 1more reaction here, and that causes the equilibrium 1constant to be less than 1. 1On the other hand, if the equilibrium constant was 1greater than 1, that means that this numerator is greater 1than this denominator. 1Which would imply that you have more concentration-- once 1you're in equilibrium, you end up with a lot more of the 1stuff on the right than you end up with the stuff on the 1left, so then that means the reaction would be going in the 1forward direction. 1The other interesting thing is you can then figure out, well, 1what happens if I add another mole of A to the reaction? 1So let's say I throw some A into the reaction. 1I add some concentration of A. 1So now my new A is equal to 2. 1Let's say my new A is equal to 2. 1Let's say my new B, let's say that I want to-- well, 1actually, we can figure out the relation between the-- 1actually, instead of going into this situation where I 1change the concentration, let me do that in the next video, 1because I just realized that I'm running very low on time. 1But hopefully, you got a good sense of what the equilibrium 1constant is all about and how it's 1measured or how it's defined. 1And in the next video, we're going to talk a little bit 1about how else it could be useful. 1In this video, you just said, oh, if it's less than 1, that 1means that the backward reaction is favored. 1If it's greater than 1, the forward reaction is favored. 1In the next video, we'll get a little intuition, hopefully, 1on why it is defined this way as opposed to, say, this way. 1My intuition said, hey, why isn't it three times the 1concentration of C divided by one times the concentration of 1A plus three times the concentration of B? 1This might have been more intuitive to me, but this 1isn't the case. 1This is what actually is constant, regardless of how 1you change the concentrations of the various reactants. 1So maybe we'll talk a little bit about why this is true and 1not necessarily this.",science_ap-chemistry_chemical-equilibrium-ap
" -  So what I want to talk about now are shapes of distributions and different words we might use to describe those shapes. So right over here, let's see, we're talking about Matt's Cafe, and we have different age buckets, so this is a histogram here. In each bucket, it tells us the number of guests that are in that age bucket. So we don't have any guests that are under the age of 20, we have a reasonable number between 20 and 30, we have a lot of guests at 30, in that bucket between 30 and 40, reasonable number between 40 and 50, and then as we get older, we have fewer and fewer guests. So just when you look at something like this, a distribution like this, something might pop out at you. It kind of looks like if you were to imagine this were an armadillo, this would be the body of the armadillo, and then what we see to the right kind of looks like the tail of the armadillo. We actually use those types of words to describe distributions. So this distribution right over here, it looks like it has a tail to the right. It doesn't have a tail to the left. In fact, we have no one under the age of 20. But here when we have a few people between 60 and 70, even fewer between 70 and 80, even fewer between 80 and 90, and you know, if it just kind of keeps going like this, this is a tail and it's on the right side, it's a right-tailed distribution. So I'd call this distribution right-tailed. I'm using Khan Academy exercises because it's a good way to see a lot of examples, and frankly, you should too because it'll help you test your knowledge. But it's not left-tailed. Left-tailed we would see a tail going like that. Frankly, if you're left-tailed and right-tailed, you're likely to be approximately symmetrical. Remember symmetry, you define a line of symmetry, and one type of symmetry is one where both sides of that line of symmetry are mirror images of each other. You could fold over the line of symmetry, and they'll roughly meet. This one does not meet that because if you were to say, hey, maybe there's a line of symmetry here and you tried to fold this over, it wouldn't match up, the two sides would not match up. So I feel good saying that it is right-tailed. So let's see. Retirement of age of each guest. Well yeah, these names aren't that great, but let's actually see what they're saying. They're saying by age, they're telling us the number of guests. So this is the number of guests at Logan Assisted Living. So we have a lot of guests that are between 60 and 70 years old, or reasonable that are between 50 and 60, or 70 or 80, and this distribution actually looks pretty symmetrical. If I were to draw a line of symmetry right down here, right at around an age of, you know, the line would be right at an age of 65, I guess you could say all this is a bucket for ages 60 to 70, then you could flip it over and it looks pretty symmetrical. Not exactly, this bucket doesn't quite match up to this one, but it's pretty close. These roughly match each other. These roughly match each other. So I feel good about saying it is approximately symmetrical. Now just to know what these other words mean, skewed to the left, or skewed to the right. These actually have fairly technical definitions when you get further in statistics, but a, I guess, easier to process version of them are when you're left tailed, you also tend to be skewed to the left, and when you are right-tailed, you tend to be skewed to the right. Another way to think about skewed to the left is that your mean is to the left of your median and mode. That might not make any sense to you. You might just want to off of the tail. If you're left-tailed, you're probably left skewed. If you're right-tailed, you're probably right skewed. So let's keep going. Let's see another example. So this interesting. We're not given a histogram here. We're not given a bar graph. We're given a box and whiskers plot, which is really just telling us the different quartiles. So just to remind ourselves, this tells us the minimum of our data set, the bottom of our range, so the minimum value in our data set. We have at least one 11, and then the maximum value of our data set, we have at least one 25. Now this line right over here is the median. The middle number is 21. Then the box defines the middle 50% of our numbers. So it's kind of the meat of our distribution. So if we were to try to visualize what this would look like as maybe a histogram, and we don't know for sure because we might have a whole bunch of 11s, not so much that it skews this, but we could have more than one. But a distribution that this could match up with is something that looks like having a tail down here, and then you kind of bump up here. This is the meat of the distribution. It kind of looks something like that, and I can't draw because I'm doing this on the exercises right now. But for something like that, well something like that would have a tail to the left, would have a tail to the left. It's range goes fairly low to the left, but it might not have a lot of value there. If I had more values on the left side, this box would have been shifted over because a larger percentage would have been on the left, so to speak. So this one, I feel pretty good about saying this is skewed to the left. It's definitely not symmetrical. If it was symmetrical, the median would be pretty close to the center, the box would be pretty centered. It's not skewed to the right. If it was skewed to the right, you would have a tail to the right, you would have, this whisker would likely be much, much, much longer. And we're done.",math_7th-grade-foundations-engageny_7th-m5-engage-ny-foundations
" We're are asked to find the cube root of negative 343. Or another way to think about it is some number that when I multiply it by itself three times, I'm going to get negative 343. Or another way to view it-- this is the same thing as negative 343 to the 1/3 power. And the best way to do this is to really just try to factor this out. So the first thing that we could do-- so let me just factor negative 343. So the first thing I'd like to do is just factor out the negative 1. So this is the same thing as negative 1 times 343. And let's think about this. Is this divisible by 2? No. Is it divisible by 3? Let's see-- the digits do not add up to a multiple of 3. They add up to 10. So it's not divisible by 3. Not divisible by 4 since it's odd. Not divisible by 5 because it doesn't end with a 5 or a 0. It's not divisible by 6, because it's not divisible by 2 or 3. Is it divisible by 7? Let's check this out. So 7 goes into 343-- 7 goes into 34 four times. 4 times 7 is 28. 34 minus 28 is going to be 6. Bring down the 3. 7 goes into 63 exactly nine times. So then we end up-- so 9 times 7 is 63, no remainder. So this is going to be 7 times 49. And we know that 49 is the same thing as 7 times 7. So how can we rewrite this? This is the same thing as taking the cube root of negative 1 times 7 times 7 times 7, which is the same thing as taking the cube root of negative 1 times the cube root of 7 times 7 times 7. Now, what's the cube root of negative 1? Well, negative 1 times itself three times is negative 1. So this right here is negative 1. You could verify it. Negative 1 times negative 1 times negative 1 is indeed negative 1. This becomes positive 1. Multiply by negative 1 again, you get negative 1. So this is negative 1. And then this over here, the cube root of 7 times 7 times 7-- well, that's just going to be 7. 7 multiplied by itself three times gives us 7 times 7 times 7 or 343. So it's going to be negative 1 times 7, which is the same thing as negative 7. So our answer is negative 7. And we're done.",math_pre-algebra_pre-algebra-exponents-radicals
" -  Shinji commutes to work and he worries about running out of fuel. The amount of fuel he uses follows a normal distribution for each part of his commute, but the amount of fuel he uses on the way home varies more. The amounts of fuel he uses for each part of the commute are also independent of each other. Here are summary statistics for the amount of fuel Shinji uses for each part of his commute. So when he goes to work he uses a mean of 10 liters of fuel, with a standard deviation of 1.5 liters. And on the way home, he also has a mean of 10 liters, but there is more variation. There is more spread. He has a standard deviation of two liters. Suppose that Shinji has 25 liters of fuel in his tank and he intends to drive to work and back home. What is the probability that Shinji runs out of fuel? All right, this is really interesting. We have the distributions for the amount of fuel he uses to work and to home, and they say that these are normal distributions. They say that right over here, follows a normal distribution. But here we're talking about the total amount of fuel he has to go to work and to go home. So what we wanna do is come up with a total distribution, home and back, I guess you could say. We could say, call this work plus home. Home and back. If you have two random variables that can be described by normal distributions and you were to define a new random variable as their sum, the distribution of that new random variable will still be a normal distribution and its mean will be the sum of the means of those other random variables. So the mean here, I'll say the mean of work plus home is going to be equal to 20 liters. He will use a mean of 20 liters in the roundtrip. Now for the standard deviation, from home plus work, you can't just add the standard deviations going and coming back. But because the amount of fuel going to work and the amount of fuel coming home are independent random variables, because they are independent of each other, we can add the variances. And only because they are independent can we add the variances. So what you can say is that the variance of the combined trip is equal to the variance of going to work plus the variance of going home. So what's the variance of going to work? Well, 1.5 squared is, so this will be 1.5 squared, and what's the variance coming home? Well, this is going to be two squared, two squared. Well, this is 2.25 plus four, which is equal to 6.25. So the variance on the roundtrip is equal to 6.25. If I were to take the square root of that, which is equal to 2.5, we can now describe the normal distribution of the roundtrip and use that to answer the question. So we have this normal distribution that might look something like this. We know its mean is 20 liters. So this is 20 liters. And we want to know what is the probability that Shinji runs out of fuel. Well, to run out of fuel, he would need to require more than 25 liters of fuel. So if 25 liters of fuel is right over here, so this is 25 liters of fuel, the scenario where Shinji runs out of fuel is right over here, this is where he needs more than 25 liters. He actually has 25 liters in his tank. So how do we figure out that area right over there? Well, we could use a z-table. We could say how many standard deviations above the mean is 25 liters? Well, it is five liters above the mean, so let me write this down. So the Z here, the Z is equal to 25 minus the mean, minus 20, divided by the standard deviation for, I guess you could say this combined normal distribution. This is two standard deviations above the mean or a z-score of plus two. So if we look at a z-table and we look exactly two standard deviations above the mean, that will give us this area, the cumulative area below two standard deviations above the mean. And then if we subtract that from one, we will get the area that we care about. So let's get our z-table out. We care about a z-score of exactly two, so 2.00 is right over here, .9772. So that tells us that this area right over here is 0.9772, and so that blue area, the probability that Shinji runs out of fuel is going to be one minus 0.9772, and what is that going to be equal to? Let's see, this is going to be equal to 0.0228. Did I do that right? I think I did that right. Yes, 0.0228 is the probability that Shinji runs out of fuel. If you want to think of it as a percent, 2.28% chance that he runs out of fuel.",math_statistics-probability_random-variables-stats-library
" -  We are told the square below represents one whole. So this big square here represents a whole. Express the shaded area as both a fraction and a decimal. So let's see, we've taken the whole and we've divided it into one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, equal sections. Each of these columns or each of these tall rectangles represent one tenth of the whole because they are ten equal sections that it has been split into. So each of these is a tenth and let's see we have filled in one, two, three, four, five, six, of those tenths. So if I wanted to represent it as a fraction I would say this is 6/10 and if I were to represent it as a decimal I would say, okay, well, I have zero ones and I have six tenths, so as a decimal it is 0.6. Let's do a couple more of these examples. So let's say, so okay, look at that. Now I have, let's see, the big square represents one whole. Express the shaded area as both a fraction and a decimal. So what's going on over here? So I have ten rows and in each row I have ten squares. So ten times ten. This has a hundred squares in it. So I've divided my whole into a hundred equal sections. So each of these little squares is one hundredth. So here I have shaded in one, two, three, four, five out of the hundred hundredths, or I could say I have five hundredths right over here. So as a fraction, I could write this as 5/100 and as a decimal I could say, oh, I have no ones. I have no tenths and I have five hundredths. Let's do a couple more examples of this. So let's say that I wanted to... Let's see, it says, express the location of the point on the number line as both a fraction and a decimal. All right. So let's think about it. So this is 2/10, this is 3/10. And you see it is 0/10, 1/10, or this is 0, 1/10, 2/10, 3/10, and before each, or between each tenth they've split it into ten equal sections. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. So each of these, each of these little hashmarks represent one hundredth. So one way you could view this is we're at two tenths, so we have two tenths, and then we're going to have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven hundredths. So we could view this point as two tenths and seven hundredths. So actually let me write it as a decimal first. So we have two tenths and we have seven hundredths. Now another way to think about this is we have 27 hundredth. You can count them. Remember each of these is one hundredth. So zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 27 hundredths. And most people when they see this number they won't say two tenths and seven hundredths. They'll just say 27 hundredths. Well how do you write 27 hundredths as a fraction? Well, it's 27/100. 27 over, over 100. Let's do, I don't know, I'm kind of in the mood. Let's do one more of these. The big square represents one whole. Express the shaded area as both a fraction and a decimal. So we've already seen, there's a hundred of these. The whole is split into a hundred equal, smaller sections. So each of these small squares is a hundredth and so how many hundredths do we have shaded in? So this is going to be ten hundredths, 20 hundredths, 21 hundredths. So as a fraction I'd write that as 21/100. Now, you could, there's a couple of ways to think about it. If we're familiar with it already we would say okay, look, two tenths is the same thing as 20 hundredths, so it's going to be two tenths and one hundredth, or 21 hundredth. Another way to think about it is this first row right over here, that's a tenth, then this next one is a tenth, so you have two tenths, and then you have a hundredth over here. So any way you want to think about it. This is 21 hundredths or two tenths and one hundredth.",math_in-in-class-4th-math-cbse_imp-decimals
" How do you maintain a steady body temperature when you're exposed to ice packs, or hot water bottles? Healthy Body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius, or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. I need to keep a steady temperature near 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or else crucial molecules in my body will change shape and stop working, and I'll die. Homeostasis is the scientific term for my body's ability to maintain its proper equilibrium temperature. But what if I'm exposed to steaming hot water, or freezing cold ice? How does my body maintain its equilibrium temperature then? Let's see. I'll cover myself with ice packs, and see how my body reacts. Five cold minutes later, let me check my body temperature. Sure enough, it's still near normal body temperature, homeostasis in action. Within a degree or so 98.6 is still considered normal. And despite how cold I feel, I haven't actually gotten any colder. How did my body do this? It made me feel cold, and want to wear myself up by shivering, little muscle movements that generate heat. See how pale my arm looks? After noticing the cold, my body directed by blood to my core, and less to my skin and extremities. My arm quickly loses heat to the cold environment, but the temperature stays constant in my core, which is thicker, so it loses less heat to the environment. I also get goosebumps, where my hair stands on end, creating an insulating layer like the jacket my body wisher I were wearing. So my body uses a lot of tools to keep my temperature up. When my body senses that it's cold, homeostasis mechanisms make me shiver, draw blood away from my skin, and give me goosebumps. These make me warmer, so my core temperature isn't changed. My body uses some of the opposite tools to cool down. It directs blood to the surface to cool down, making me a bit pink. It needs to resort to more extreme measures if I want to be active in the heat, because moving my muscles uses energy and lets off heat, sort of like shivering to keep warm in the cold. But in this case, my body needs to counteract the warmth that the movement causes. My body makes me feel exhausted, urging me to stop running in place, but that's not enough if I'm excited to be running for some reason. It also makes me sweat. In order to get the energy to evaporate into the air, sweat pulls heat from my body, and this helps me cool down. Not all animals have as effective sweat glands as people do, so people can endure longer periods of intense activity than many other animals. When I got warm, homeostasis mechanisms let my blood move near the surface of my skin, and made me sweat, so I got cooler. There are other forms of homeostasis to regulate things besides temperature. For example, when your blood pressure drops suddenly, which can happen if you stand up suddenly, your blood vessels constrict, which brings your blood pressure up to normal. Also, if your blood sugar rises, which can happen after eating, your pancreas releases insulin to lower your blood sugar back to normal. Diabetes is the disease that affects your body's ability to maintain blood sugar homeostasis. In general, homeostasis is when our bodies recognize a slight drift from healthy conditions, and counteract that drift by nudging us back to equilibrium.",science_high-school-biology_hs-human-body-systems
" Sally is an architect who creates a blueprint of a rectangular dining room. The area of the actual dining room is 1,600 times larger than the area of the dining room on the blueprint. The length of the dining room on the blueprint is 3 inches. What is the length of the actual dining room in feet? So there's a couple of really interesting things going on here. They give us the dimensions of the blueprint in inches. We want the actual length in feet. And then they tell us that the area of the actual dining room is 1,600 times larger. So they're not saying that the scale of the blueprint is at 1/1600. It's going to be something less than that, and let's think about what that scale is going to be. Let's just think about some different scales. Let's say that this is my blueprint, and this is the actual reality of the dining room that we're thinking about. And my blueprint is let's just say 1 by 1, just for the sake of argument. Now, if this was a 1 by 1 square and we increased the dimensions by a factor of 2, so it's a 2 by 2 square, what's the area going to be? Well, this area is going to be 4. This area is 1, this area is 4. So you notice that if we increase by a factor of 2, it increase our area by a factor of 4. Or another way of saying, if we increase each of our dimensions by a factor of 2, we're going to increase our area by a factor of 4. If instead we increased each of our dimensions by a factor of 3, this would be a 3 by 3 square, and we would increase our area by a factor of 9. So notice, whatever factor we're increasing the area by, it's going to be the factor that we're increasing the dimensions by squared. So let's just think about it that way. So they're telling us that we're increasing the area by 1,600 times. Actually, let me just clean this thing up a little bit. So one way we could imagine it, if our drawing did have an area of 1, which we can't assume, but we could for the sake of just figuring out what the scale of the drawing is. Let me clear all of this here. So the area of the actual dining room is 1,600 times larger, and so if the drawing had an area of 1, then the area of the actual dining room would be 1,600 So what would I have to multiply each of the dimensions by to get an area factor of 1,600? Well, if I multiply this dimension by 40 and this dimension by 40, we see 40 times 40 is 1,600. You might say, hey, Sal, how did you figure out 40? Well, the 16 is a big clue. We know that 4 times 4 is equal to 16, and so if you gave a 0 to each of these 4's, if you made it 40 times 40, then that is going to be 1,600. So this information right over here tells us that the scale factor of the lengths is 40. That would result in an scale factor for the area of 1,600. So that's a good starting point. Now let's go to the actual dining room on the blueprint. So the actual dining room on the blueprint doesn't have these dimensions. We just used that to figure out the scaling factor. The actual dining room on the blueprint has a length of 3 inches. So maybe it looks something like this. They don't give us any of the other dimensions, so we can even imagine a 3 inch by 2 inch, 1 inch, whatever we want. We could even imagine a 3 inch by 3 inch square. They only care about the length. Now let's multiply both of these by a factor of 40. And we only care about the length here. They actually say what's the length of the actual dining room. So let's multiply it, and obviously, this is not drawn to scale. Let's multiply this times a factor of 40. So 3 times 40 is 120, and this, of course, is what we're referring to as the length. Now, you might be tempted to say OK, we're done. This will be 120. But remember, this is 120 inches. So what is 120 inches in terms of feet? Well, 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. If we were to multiply both of these times 10, we know that 10 feet is equal to 120 inches. Or another way you could have thought about it, you have 120 inches divided by 12 inches per foot is going to give you 10. So 120 divided by-- 120 inches-- let me write it this way. 120 inches divided by 12 inches per foot is going to give you 10 feet. So that's the actual length of the dining room in feet.",math_7th-engage-ny_engage-7th-module-4
" So we have this bead machine that we can represent numbers with. And now I'm wondering... we could probably add with this too; save us some time. But I haven't tried it out yet; I don't really know the process. So what do you wanna ask? Let's just start simple. Alright. One digits, please. Simple: seven plus five. Seven plus five. Alright let's see so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven; one, two, three, pause. So seven plus five, which is ten, is the exact same thing as this right over here. And so now, this is ten, so I've only added three so far. You wanted me to add five. Yes. So I have to add four and five. So I get to ten plus two which is twelve. Ah, so this is like a carrying operation, as I've been told. Yeah, well essentially what happened was, you know, I started with the seven, and when I added three, all of a sudden I've kind of maxed out this column here. And what I did is I re-represented this ten, now, in this place. So, I re-represented there. So, if I was thinking about it in a way we'd normally add when we have numbers, you could go up to nine in a place. So you'd start with zero, and then you could go up to nine, and so you can't write ten in one place, at least the way we traditionally do math, so instead, you just represent one of the next place over. So this represents ten. And this applies all the way up? I think so. So let me give you a quick two-digit number. I followed that one, but this one is confusing. So, twenty-three plus seventy-seven. Alright, so let's see. Twenty-three. This is twenty, and three. Twenty-three plus seventy-seven. So let's think about this a little bit. So, twenty-three and seventy-seven. So let's add the seven first. So we're gonna add one, two, three, four, five, six, seven; but we can swap all of these in for one more of those. So so far I've just added seven. Now I just have to add seventy to this. 'Cause seventy-seven. I just added seven only; now I have to add seven. So now let's add ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy; and I could leave it like that but even better, I can swap all of those in for one of these. So that's a hundred. Ah. Very good. It's a very simple way to represent the hundred. One-zero-zero. Got it.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_math-warmup
" -  So let's think about a function. I'll just give an example. Let's say, h of n is equal to one-fourth times two to the n. So, first of all, you might notice something interesting here. We have the variable, the input into our function. It's in the exponent. And a function like this is called an exponential function. So this is an exponential. Ex-po-nen-tial. Exponential function, and that's because the variable, the input into our function, is sitting in its definition of what is the output of that function going to be. The input is in the exponent. I could write another exponential function. I could write, f of, let's say the input is a variable, t, is equal to is equal to five times times three to the t. Once again, this is an exponential function. Now there's a couple of interesting things to think about in exponential function. In fact, we'll explore many of them, but I'll get a little used to the terminology, so one thing that you might see is a notion of an initial value. In-i-tial Intitial value. And this is essentially the value of the function when the input is zero. So, for in these cases, the initial value for the function, h, is going to be, h of zero. And when we evaluate that, that's going to be one-fourth times two to the zero. Well, two to the zero power, is just one. So it's equal to one-fourth. So the initial value, at least in this case, it seems to just be that number that sits out here. We have the initial value times some number to this exponent. And we'll come up with the name for this number. Well let's see if this was true over here for, f of t. So, if we look at its intial value, f of zero is going to be five times three to the zero power and, the same thing again. Three to the zero is just one. Five times one is just five. So the initial value is once again, that. So if you have exponential functions of this form, it makes sense. Your initial value, well if you put a zero in for the exponent, then the number raised to the exponent is just going to be one, and you're just going to be left with that thing that you're multiplying by that. Hopefully that makes sense, but since you're looking at it, hopefully it does make a little bit. Now, you might be saying, well what do we call this number? What do we call that number there? Or that number there? And that's called the common ratio. The common common ratio. And in my brain, we say well why is it called a common ratio? Well, if you thought about integer inputs into this, especially sequential integer inputs into it, you would see a pattern. For example, h of, let me do this in that green color, h of zero is equal to, we already established one-fourth. Now, what is h of one going to be equal to? It's going to be one-fourth times two to the first power. So it's going to be one-fourth times two. What is h of two going to be equal to? Well, it's going to be one-fourth times two squared, so it's going to be times two times two. Or, we could just view this as this is going to be two times h of one. And actually I should have done this when I wrote this one out, but this we can write as two times h of zero. So notice, if we were to take the ratio between h of two and h of one, it would be two. If we were to take the ratio between h of one and h of zero, it would be two. That is the common ratio between successive whole number inputs into our function. So, h of I could say h of n plus one over h of n is going to be equal to is going to be equal to actually I can work it out mathematically. One-fourth times two to the n plus one over one-fourth times two to the n. That cancels. Two to the n plus one, divided by two to the n is just going to be equal to two. That is your common ratio. So for the function h. For the function f, our common ratio is three. If we were to go the other way around, if someone said, hey, I have some function whose initial value, so let's say, I have some function, I'll do this in a new color, I have some function, g, and we know that its initial initial value is five. And someone were to say its common ratio its common ratio is six, what would this exponential function look like? And they're telling you this is an exponential function. Well, g of let's say x is the input, is going to be equal to our initial value, which is five. That's not a negative sign there, Our initial value is five. I'll write equals to make that clear. And then times our common ratio to the x power. So once again, initial value, right over there, that's the five. And then our common ratio is the six, right over there. So hopefully that gets you a little bit familiar with some of the parts of an exponential function, why they are called what they are called.",math_algebra_exponential-growth-decay
" -  Given the graph of y equals f of x pictured below, determine the equations of all vertical asymptotes. Let's see what's going on here. So it looks like interesting things are happening at x equals negative four and x equals two. At x equals negative four, as we approach it from the left the value of the function just becomes unbounded right over here. Looks like as we approach x equals negative four from the left, the value of our function goes to infinity. Likewise, as we approach x equals negative four from the right, it looks like our, the value of our function goes to infinity. So, I'd say that we definitely have a vertical asymptote at x equals negative four. Now, let's look at x equals two. As we approach x equals two from the left, the value of our function once again approaches infinity, or it becomes unbounded. Now, from the right, we have an interesting thing. If we look at the limit from the right right over here, it looks like we're approaching a finite value. As we approach x equals two from the right, it looks like we're approaching f of x is equal to negative four. But, just having a one-sided limit that is unbounded, is enough to think about this as a vertical asymptote. The function is not defined right over here, and as we approach it from just one side, we are becoming unbounded. It looks like we're approaching infinity or negative infinity, so that by itself, this unbounded left hand limit, or left-side limit by itself is enough to consider x equals two a vertical asymptote. So, we can say that there's a vertical asymptote at x equals negative four and x equals two.",math_calculus-all-old_limits-and-continuity-calc
" Match these angles with their measures. There should be one angle in each category. We have 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, and 180 degrees. So there's a few that are very easy to spot out. This angle right over here, it makes a complete line. So this is clearly 180 degrees. So this one's 180 degrees. The other one that might jump out at you is this one right over here. This is clearly a right angle, or a 90-degree angle right over here. So this is 90 degrees. And so we have to think which of these is 30 and which is 60 degrees? Well, just by comparing it that way, you know that the one that opens out more is going to be 60 degrees and the one that opens out less is going to be 30 degrees. And you can see that this, the opening here, is half the size of the opening right over here. So it makes sense that this is 30, this is 60, and it also makes sense that this angle is 1/3 the measure of this angle right over here, that this is 90 degrees. And then if you were to double this, then this part of the angle would go all the way out, and you would get to the 180 degrees. So let's check our answer and make sure we actually got this one right. Let's do one more, just for fun. Which of these angles has a measure of 60 degrees? So there's a couple that we can immediately rule out. This angle here is clearly more than 90 degrees. It's an obtuse angle. This angle here is 180 degrees, so we're going to have to pick between these two. And we can assume that these are all at scale. So if we know that a right angle would have this line straight up and down, this looks like it's 2/3 of the way there. So I would go with this one right over there. Now, you might say, well, what about this one? Well, this one looks like it's about 1/3 of a right angle. If we were to do 2/3, then 3/3, it looks like we would get to a right angle. So this one looks much closer to 30 degrees. So which of these angles has a measure of 60? That one right over there. You could immediately rule out that one and that one, and then these take a little bit closer inspection.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-pair-of-angles-icse
" What is the image of the polygon below after the translation is capital T with the subscript 5 comma 2? So that means let's translate 5 in the horizontal direction and 2 in the vertical direction. So let's do that. So I'm going to focus on this point right over here. So that point is at the point 3 comma 3. If I want to translate five in the horizontal direction, the x value is going to get to 8. So the x value is going to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And then we want to increase the y value by 2. 1, 2. Let's check our answer. Let's do a couple more of these. That was lot of fun. So here we need to shift it by negative 8 in the horizontal direction. So this one right over here, it's x value is 0, so we need to go essentially negative 8, negative 1, negative 2, or we move to the left 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And then we have to move it down by 2. So we have to move down 1, move it down 2. And we're done.",math_geometry-home_transformations
" -  Do some example, raising exponents or products of exponents to various powers, especially when we're dealing with integer exponents. So let's say we have three to the negative eight times seven to the third, and we wanna raise that to the negative two power, and I want you to pause this video and see if you could simplify this on your own. So the key realization here, there's couple of ways that you can tackle it, but the key thing to realize is if you have the product of two things, and then you're raising that to some type of a exponent, that is going to be the same thing as raising each of these things to that exponent, and then taking the product. So this is going to be the same thing as three to the negative eight, and then that to the negative two times seven to the third to the negative two, so I'll do seven to the third right over here. And if I wanna simplify this, three to the negative eight to the negative two, we have the other exponent property that if you're raising to an exponent and then raising that whole thing to another exponent, then you can just multiply the exponents. So this is going to be three to the negative eight times negative two power. Well, negative eight times negative two is positive 16, so this is gonna be three to the 16th power right over there, and then this part right over here, seven to the third to the negative two. that's gonna be seven to the three times negative two, which is seven to the negative sixth power. So that is seven to the negative six, and this would be about as much as you could simplify. You could rewrite it different ways. Seven to the negative six is the same thing as one over seven to the sixth, so you could write it like three to the 16th. We'll use that same shade of blue, three to the 16th over seven to the sixth, but these two are equivalent, and there's other ways that you could have tackled this. You could have said that this original thing right over here, this is the same thing as, three to the negative eight is the same thing as one over three to the eighth, so you could have said this is the same thing as seven to the third over three to the eighth, and then you're raising that to the negative two, in which case you'd raise this numerator to the negative two and the denominator to negative two, but you would have gotten to the exact same place. Let's do another one of these. So let's say that we have got A to the negative two times eight to the seventh power, and we wanna raise all of that to the second power. Well, like before, I can raise each of these things to the second power, so this is the same thing as A to the negative two to the second power times this thing to the second power. Eight to the seventh to the second power, and then here, negative two times two is negative four, so that's A to the negative four times, eight to the seven times two is 14, eight to the 14th power. In other videos, we go into more depth about why this should hopefully make intuitive sense. Here you have eight to the seventh times eight to the seventh. Well, you would then add the two exponents, and you would get to eight to the 14th, so however many times you have eight to the seventh, you would just keep adding the exponents, or you would multiply by seven that many times. Hopefully that didn't sound too confusing, but the general idea is if you raise something to exponent and then another exponent, you can multiply those exponents. Let's do one more example where we are dealing with quotients, which that first example could have even been perceived as. So let's say we have two to the negative 10 divided by four squared, and we're gonna raise all of that to the seventh power. Well, this is equivalent to two to the negative 10 raised to the seventh power over four squared raised to the seventh power, so if you have the difference of two things and you're raising it to some power, that's the same thing as a numerator raised to that power divided by the denominator raised to that power. Well, what's our numerator going to be? Well, we've done this drill before. It'd be two to the negative 10 times seventh power, so this would be equal to two to the negative 70th power, and then in the denominator, four to the second power, then that raised to the seventh power. Well, two times seven is 14, so that's going to be four to the 17th power. Now, we actually could think about simplifying this even more. There's multiple ways that you could rewrite this, but one thing you could do is say, ""Hey, look, ""four is a power of two."" So you could rewrite this as this is equal to two to the negative 70th power over, instead of writing four to the 17th power, why did I write the 17th power? It should be four to the 14th power. Let me correct that. Instead of writing four to the 14th power, I instead could write, so this is two, get the colors right. This is two to the negative 70th over, instead of writing four, I could write two squared to the 14th power. Four is the same thing as two squared, and so now I can rewrite this whole thing as two to the negative 70th power over, well, two to the second, and then that to the 14th, well, that's two to the 28th power, two to the 28th power. And so can I simplify this even more? Well, this is going to be equal to two to the, if I'm taking a quotient with the same base, I can subtract the exponent. So it's gonna be negative 70. It's going to be negative 70 minus 28th power, minus 28, and so this is going to simply two to the negative 98th power, and that's another way of viewing the same expression.",math_pre-algebra_pre-algebra-exponents-radicals
" All right. I'm going to start out with a challenge for you. I'm going to show you a series of shapes, and I want you to count the number of yellow stars that you see. Also, count the number of red X's that pop up on the screen, so that's two separate numbers, one for how many yellow stars you see and one for how many red X's come up on the screen. All right. So that was probably a challenging task because you had to count two different things and I kept talking to you while you were trying to do that. That's an example of divided attention, which we'll talk about in just a second. But first, you probably want to see how you did. So let me show you everything you just saw. All right, this is everything that popped up on your screen. There were 15 yellow stars and 13 red X's, and also one smiley face. Don't worry it if you didn't see this guy. We'll talk about that later. But now that you have a good example of how limited a resource your attention is, let's talk more about it. When you're paying attention to something, that means that you're concentrating on it at the exclusion of the other stimuli in the environment. A lot of times, though, we try to divide our attention and do multiple things at once. So maybe you watch TV while studying, or try to count yellow stars while trying to count red X's. The thing is, as you just saw, attention is a limited resource, and we can't split it all that well when it comes to complicated stimuli. So if you're trying to do two things at once, you usually end up switching between those tasks rather than doing them simultaneously, even if you're switching so fast you can barely tell. So think back to when you had to count the yellow stars and the red X's. You couldn't really do that at the same time. You had to kind of flip back and forth. When you switch, or if you do just intend to focus on one thing at a time, you're exercising your selective attention. You can think of selective attention like a flashlight beam on some aspect of your environment. You can move the flashlight around, depending on what you want to focus on, but at any given moment, it's illuminating one particular area of interest, and everything else is just kind of dimmer. So the question is, what causes your flashlight beam to swing around and focus on one thing or another? There are two types of cues that can direct our attention, exogenous and endogenous. Exogenous cues are external to any goals we might have, meaning we don't have to tell ourselves to look for them in order for them to capture our attention. They include things like bright colors or loud noises, because you can be in the middle of a gripping conversation and have every intention on focusing on it, but a loud noise will still cause your focus to shift. And with salient visual cues, the ones that really stand out, this is called the pop-out effect. Something just pops out at us, like a yellow circle amidst a bunch of green circles. Endogenous cues, on the other hand, are more internalized and higher order, meaning they involve the internal knowledge to understand the cue in the first place, and the intention to follow it. Take an arrow, for example. If you didn't know what an arrow meant, then you wouldn't know to follow it. It's just some random lines on a piece of paper. But because you have the internal knowledge of what an arrow is, you can carry out an intention to look where it's pointing. One really good example of selective attention is the cocktail party effect, which you've probably experienced yourself multiple times. And this is your ability to attend to one voice even amidst many others. And it most commonly occurs when you hear your own name amid those voices. So, for example, picture the last time you had a big family dinner, and you're at one end of the table talking with someone, and then Grandma down at the other end of the table says your name. And even though you haven't been listening to grandma's conversation, you instantly swing your flashlight beam of attention down to hear what she's saying about you. And if you had to guess what type of cue your name was in that situation, endogenous or exogenous, what would you say? If you said endogenous, then that's right. Because it was the meaning of your name that drew your attention to when Grandma said it. All right. So now we know that different cues draw our attention to certain stimuli, whether we want them to or not. But what happens to all the stuff we're not paying attention to? Scarily enough, we experience something called an inattentional blindness, which means that we're not consciously aware of things that happen in our visual field when our attention is directed elsewhere within that field. So think back to that smiley face from our demo in the beginning. Because you were focused on yellow stars and red X's, you might have missed the smiley face, especially because he kind of blended in with the yellow stars. And that's a minor example, but inattentional blindness happens in more important situations too. For example, can you say exactly where the nearest fire extinguisher is? If you're like most people, you probably go by this every day when you're going to your home or office or wherever you are, but very few people actually pay attention to where things like fire extinguishers are, even though they're bright red and they can be necessary for our survival. Usually your attention is directed elsewhere, so you fail to notice the fire extinguisher. Closely related to inattentional blindness is change blindness, which is when we fail to notice changes in the environment. Now be careful, because the difference between change blindness and inattentional blindness is subtle but important. Inattentional blindness means that you miss something right in front of you, while change blindness means that you fail to notice a difference between a previous state and a current state, like when you don't notice when your mom gets a haircut or you get back to your room and don't notice that furniture or books are in a different place. And this is actually very common as well, so don't feel bad if it happens to you. In fact, there's one really good example when a researcher stopped people on a busy street and asked for directions. And part way through when the people were giving their directions, a large bookcase was carried between them and the researcher, and he swapped places with a different person. And almost no one noticed. And very few people even noticed when the new person was a different race or gender. So it was just a great example of our limited attention and our ability to focus on one thing to the exclusion of everything else.",science_health-and-medicine_executive-systems-of-the-brain
" Treba da rastavimo 20u na kvadrat puta v manje 10 uv na kvadrat I kada treba da rastavimo ovakav binom koji ima dva monoma, ustvari treba da ga zapišemo kao proizvod jednog ili više monoma Da vidimo možemo li to da uradimo. Najlakši način da to uradimo je da vidimo postoji li neki zajednički činilac? Hajde da nađemo najveći zajednički činilac svakog od ovih monoma i onda ga izvucimo ispred zagrade. Ovaj smer distributivnosti zovemo izvlačenje ispred zagrade i uskoro ću vam ga pokazati. Vi ćete vremenom moći to da uradite odmah, napamet, ali sada ćemo korak po korak. Dakle, kako se rastavlja 20u na kvadrat puta v? 20u na kvadrat puta v rastavljamo na sledeći način 20 je 2 puta 2 puta 5 Jel tako? To je 2 puta 10, i to je 20. u na kvadrat puta v je u puta u i još puta jedno v. sada napišimo 20u na kvadrat puta v kao proizvod njegovih najmanjih činilaca, njegovih osnovnih činilaca, prostih brojeva i samo u-ova i v-ova. Sada uradimo isto za 10uv na kvadrat. stavičemo i minus da ne bismo izmenili izraz. 10 je, kada ga rastavimo, 2 puta 5. Zatim imamo u i v puta v. To je v na kvadrat, v puta v. Šta je najveći zajednički činilac ova dva monoma? Da vidimo. Oba imaju 2 Oba imaju 2 ovde. Zaokružiću ovo, treba da zaokružim ovo. Oba imaju 5 - to je jedno 5, jedno 5. Oba i aju jedno u, jedno u ovde, jedno u ovde. Ovaj ima dva, ali ima samo on, i oba imaju najmanje jedno v. Dakle, najveći zajednički činilac je 2 puta 5 puta u puta v. Pa možemo da ponovo zapišemo ovaj izraz, i izvučemo ispred zagrade 2 puta 5 puta u puta v, i šta dobijamo? Ako napišemo 2 puta 5 puta u puta v, dobićemo da je dati izraz jednak ovo puta šta? Pa ako izvučemo 2 puta 5 puta u puta v ispred, u zagradi od prvog monoma ostaje 2 puta u,pa imamo 2u. A od drugog monoma će ostati samo v. Jel tako? Sve ostalo je izvučeno ispred. Sve što je ostalo unutra je v. Možemo da proverimo, ako pomnožimo 2 puta 5 puta u puta v puta 2u, dobićemo prvi monom. Dakle ako se oslobodimo zagrade, dobićemo prvi monom. A ako pomnožimo 2 puta 5 puta u puta v sa ovim v. dobićemo drugi monom. Dakle ovaj izraz i ovaj izraz su isti. Rastavili smo ga i sada možemo da ga uprostimo. 2 puta 5 puta u puta v pišemo kao 10uv. A u zagradi imamo 2u manje v. I gotovi smo! rastavili smo izraz. Vi nećete rastavljati ovako postupno, ali ovo je najbolji način da razumete. Vremenom ćete reći, čekaj, najveći broj koji deli oba monoma je 10. Jer znate da 10 deli i 20 i 10. takođe, u je sadržano u ova, a i v takođe. Pa možemo odmah da izvučemo 10uv, i kada prvi podelimo ostaće nam 2u. A kada podelimo drugi sa 10uv, ostaće nam v To je još jedan način za rešavanje. Hajde da uradimo, da biste videli da je to ista stvar. Još jedan način, mogli biste reći, jeste sledeći-- Najveći broj koji deli oba je 10uv, i biće 20u na kvadrat v sa 10uv manje ovo. 10uv na kvadrat sa 10uv Ovaj izraz i ovaj su isti Ako se oslobodimo zagrade skratiće se svaki imenilac. Dakle u pitanju je ista stvar, ali možemo da uprostimo. Imamo da je 20 podeljeno sa 10 jednako 2, u na kvadrat podeljeno sa u je jednako u, v podeljeno sa v je 1, 10 podeljeno sa 10 je 1, u podeljeno sa u je u, v na kvadrat podeljeno sa v je v.

" -  What we're going to do in this video is continue our journey trying to understand what the expected value and what the variance of a binomial variable is going to be or what the expected value or the variance of a binominal distribution is going to be which is just the distribution of a binomial variable. And so, like in the last video I have this binomial variable X that's defined in a very general sense. It's the number of successes from N trials, so it's a finite number of trials where the probability of success is equal to P, so the probability is constant across the trials for each of these independent trials, so the probability of success in one trial is not dependent on what happened in the other rials. And we also talked in that previous video where we talked about the expected value of this binomial variable we said hey, it could be viewed that this binomial variable can be viewed as the sum of N of what you could really consider to be a Bernoulli variable here. So, this variable, this random variable Y, the probability that's equal to one, you could do that as a success is equal to P. The probability that it's a failure that Y is equal to zero is one minus P, so you could view Y, the outcome of Y or whether Y is one or zero is really whether we had a success or not in each of these trials, so if you add up N Ys, then you are going to get X and we use that information to figure out what the expected value of X is going to be because the expected value of Y is pretty straightforward to directly compute. Expected value of Y is just the probability weighted outcomes. So, it's P times one plus one minus P, one minus P, times zero, times zero. This whole term's gonna be zero and so, the expected value of Y is really just P and so, if you said the expected value of X, well, that's just going to be, let me just write it over here, this is all review, we could say that the expected value of X is just going to be equal to, we know from our expected value properties that it's going to be equal to the sum of the expected values of these N Ys, or you could say it is N times the expected value, times the expected value of Y, the expected value of Y is P, so this is going to be equal to N times P. Now, we're gonna do the same idea to figure out what the variance of X is going to be equal to because we could see, we know from our variance properties, you can't do this with standard deviation but you could do it with variance and then once you figure out the variance, you just take the square root for the standard deviation, the variance of X is similarly going to be the sum of the variances of these N Ys. So, it's gonna be similarly N times the variance, N times the variance of Y. So, this all boils down to what is the variance of Y going to be equal be? So, let me scroll over a little bit, get a little bit of more real estate and I will figure that out right over here. Alright, so we wanna figure out the variance of Y, so variance of Y is going to be equal to what? Well, here it's going to be the probability squared distances from the expected value. So, we have a probability of P where what is going to be our squared distance from the expected value? Well, we're going to get a one with a probability of P, so in that case our distance from the mean or from the expected value, we're at one, the expected value we already know is equal to P, so that's that for that possible outcome, the squared distance times its probability weight and then we have, actually let me scroll over, well, I'll just do it right over here, plus we have a probability of one minus P, one minus P for the other possible outcome, so in that outcome we are at zero and the difference between zero and our expected value? Well, that's just going to be zero minus P and once again we are going to square that quantity and so, this is the expression for the variance of Y and we can simplify it a little bit. So, this is all going to be equal to, so, P times one minus P squared and then is just going to be P squared times one minus P plus P squared times one minus P and let's see, we can factor out a P times one minus P, so what is that going to be left with? So, if we factor out a P times one minus P here, we're just going to be left with a one minus P and if we factor out a P times one minus P here, we're just going to have a plus P. These two cancel out. This is just this whole thing is just a one. So, you're left with P times one minus P which is indeed the variance for a binomial variable. We actually proved that in other videos. I guess it doesn't hurt to see it again but there you have. We know what the variance of Y is. It is P times one minus P and the variance of X is just N times the variance of Y, so there we go, we deserve a little bit of a drum roll, the variance of X is equal to N times P times one minus P. So, if we were to take the concrete example of the last video where if I were to take 10 free throws, so each trial is a shot, is a free throw, so if I were to take 10 free throws and my probability of success is 0.3, I have a 30% free throw percentage, the variance that I would expect to see, so in that case the variance if X is the number of free throws I make after these 10 shots, my variance will be 10 times 0.3, 0.3 times one minus 0.3, so 0.7 and so, that would be what? This right over, so this would be equal to 10 times .3 times .7 times 0.21, so my variance in this situation is going to be equal to 2.1. Is equal to 2.1 and if I wanted to figure out the standard deviation of this right over here, I would just take the square root of this, so if we want the standard deviation, just take the square root of this expression right over here.",math_statistics-probability_random-variables-stats-library
" Let's say that we have the indefinite integral, and the function is 3x squared plus 2x times e to x to the third plus x squared dx. So how would we go about solving this? So first when you look at it, it seems like a really complicated integral. We have this polynomial right over here being multiplied by this exponential expression, and over here in the exponent, we essentially have another polynomial. It seems kind of crazy. And the key intuition here, the key insight is that you might want to use a technique here called u-substitution. And I'll tell you in a second how I would recognize that we have to use u-substitution. And then over time, you might even be able to do this type of thing in your head. u-substitution is essentially unwinding the chain rule. And the chain rule-- I'll go in more depth in another video, where I really talk about that intuition. But the way I would think about it is, well, I have this crazy exponent right over here. I have the x to the third plus x squared, and this thing right over here happens to be the derivative of x to the third plus x squared. The derivative of x to the third is 3x squared, derivative of x squared is 2x, which is a huge clue to me that I could use u-substitution. So what I do here is this thing, or this little expression here, where I also see its derivative being multiplied, I can set that equal to u. So I can say u is equal to x to the third plus x squared. Now, what is going to be the derivative of u with respect to x? du dx. Well, we've done this multiple times. It's going to be 3x squared plus 2x. And now we can write this in differential form. And du dx, this isn't really a fraction of the differential of du divided by differential of dx. It really is a form of notation, but it is often useful to kind of pretend that it is a fraction, and you could kind of view this if you wanted to just get a du, if you just wanted to get a differential form over here, how much does u change for a given change in x? You could multiply both sides times a dx. So both sides times a dx. And so if we were to pretend that they were fractions, and it will give you the correct differential form, you're going to be left with du is equal to 3x squared plus 2x dx. Now why is this over here? Why did I go to the trouble of doing that? Well we see we have a 3x squared plus 2x, and then it's being multiplied by a dx right over here. I could rewrite this original integral. I could rewrite this as the integral of-- and let me do it in that color-- of 3x squared plus 2x times dx times e-- let me do that in that other color-- times e to the x to the third plus x squared. Now what's interesting about this? Well the stuff that I have in magenta here is exactly equal to du. This is exactly equal to du. And then this stuff I have up here, x to the third plus x squared, that is what I set u equal to. That is going to be equal to u. So I can rewrite my entire integral, and now you might recognize why this is going to simplify things a good bit, it's going to be equal to-- and what I'm going to do is I'm going to change the order. I'm going to put the du, this entire du, I'm gonna stick it on the other side here, so it looks like more of the standard form that we're used to seeing our indefinite integrals in. So we're going to have our du times e to the u. And so what would the antiderivative of this be in terms of u? Well, the derivative of e to the u is e to the u. The antiderivative of e to the u is e to the u. So it's going to be equal to e to the u. Now, there is a possibility that there was some type of a constant factor here, so let me write that. So plus c. And now, to get it in terms of x, we just have to unsubstitute the u. We know what u is equal to, so we could say that this is going to be equal to e. Instead of writing u, we could say u is x to the third plus x squared. And then we have our plus c. And we are done. We have found the antiderivative. And I encourage you to take the derivative of this, and I think you will find yourself using the chain rule, and getting right back to what we had over here.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-antiderivatives-ftc
" Let's say that today-- and we'll call today Day 1-- Day 1 is a Monday. What I want to figure out is what is the Day 300 going to be? What day of the week will Day 300 be? And I encourage you to pause the video and think about that a little bit. So let's just write out the days of the week. You have Monday-- I'll do this in a different color-- you have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. So if we had a lower number here, we could just fill this out. Monday is Day 1. Tuesday's Day 2. Wednesday, Day 3. 4, 5, 6, 7. I'll keep going. Day 8, well, that's going to be a Monday again. 9 10. I'm almost writing a calendar out. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. So this is kind of useful. I could just write it out if I wanted to figure out something Day 16 or Day 20. I could just write that out. But this isn't that helpful if I want to figure out Day 300 or especially wouldn't be helpful if I wanted to figure out Day 3,000. So can I come up with some mathematical way of thinking about what Day 300 is going to be? Well, as you see when I started drawing this grid here, this grid has rows. And each row, you have seven days in it. And that makes sense. There are seven days of the week. So is there a way that if someone just gave you 16 without drawing this grid, then you would know that 16 is a Tuesday? Well, one way to think about it that might jump out at you is you could divide 16 by 7. That will tell you how many of these rows will come before 16. So 16 divided by 7 is 2. You have 2 rows before 16 right over here. You could get 7 into 16 2 times. And then you have a remainder. What is the remainder when you divide 16 by 7? 16 divided by 7 is going to be 2. 2 times 7 is 14. You're going to have a remainder of 2. So when we divide, we've historically cared more about this 2. We normally care more about well, how many times does it go into it. But now, the remainder is actually interesting. The remainder is really interesting here. Because the remainder tells you-- the first two just tells you 7 goes into 16 2 times. That's how many rows you have before getting to the 16. But then the remainder tells you in that row where is the 16? So the 16 is remainder 2. So the 16 is not the first. It's the second entry in the third row. And so it's going to be a Tuesday. Tuesday is the second day. I know what you're saying. Does that always work? Well, let's try it out with some other examples. Let's imagine Day 25. So let's just divide 25 by 7. So I'll do it right over-- I could do it. I'm going to make sure I have enough space. So if I have 7 goes into 25, it goes 3 times. 3 times 7 is 21. You have a remainder of 4. So let's see. So based on that-- so let me rewrite this-- so 25 divided by 7 is equal to 3, remainder 4. So based on this, if we were to write out the grid, we should have three rows of 7 before we get to the 25. And then 25 should sit in the fourth column. So if it's sitting in the fourth column, it should be a Thursday. So Day 25, based on this little math we just did, should be a Thursday. Let's see if that actually works out. So let's go to 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25. It is indeed a Thursday. But it makes complete sense. You could get seven rows in it before the row that gets to 25. And then in that row, it's going to be the fourth entry, because you have a remainder of 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. It's going to be a Thursday. So now we're ready to answer the question. What is Day 300 going to be? So let's just divide 300 by 7 and see where we get. 7 goes into 30 4 times. 4 times 7 is 28. Subtract, you get 2. Bring down a 0. 7 goes into 20 2 times. 2 times 7 is 14. And then we get our remainder. And now we care much more about the remainder. 20 minus 14 is 6. So our remainder is 6. So if we think about what day of the week it is, in its row it's going to be the sixth entry. It's going to be the sixth column. There's going to be 42 rows above it. But we care about which entry it is in its row. So Day 300 is going to be the sixth day of the week, the way we've written it out. It is going to be a Saturday.",math_ab-sixth-grade-math_ab-patterns-relations
" Two corrections I want to make to the video on the sodium potassium pump. One very minor one-- and I don't think it would trip too many of you guys up, but near the end of the video, as we learned, we have potassium getting pumped into the cell by the sodium potassium pump. Let me draw the membrane. It'll actually be useful in the more significant correction I'd like to make. So let me draw a cross section of a cell membrane. And let me draw the sodium potassium pump right here. We saw it pumps out three sodiums for every two potassiums that it pumps in. It definitely doesn't look like that, but it gives the idea. And we're pumping potassium ions in-- so K plus-- and we're pumping sodium ions out-- and that's what the whole point of that video was. When this thing changes shape with ATP, it pumps the sodium ions out. Now the minor correction I want to make-- and I don't think it would have tripped you up too much-- is near the end of that video, I drew the potassium ions-- and I wrote a K plus, but a few times near the end of the video, I referred to them as sodium ions-- and I don't want that to confuse you at all. It is potassium ions that are getting pumped in. Two potassium ions get pumped in for every three sodium ions that get pumped out. So I don't want-- even thought I drew a K plus, sometimes I said sodium by accident. Don't want that to confuse you. That is the minor error. The more significant error is that I said that the main reason that we had this potential difference-- why it is more positive on the outside than the inside-- so this is less positive. I said that the main reason was because of this ratio. We're pumping out three sodium ions for every two potassium ions that we pump in. And I just got a very nice letter from a professor of physiology, Steven Baylor at University of Pennsylvania, and he wrote a very interesting email and it corrects me. And it's a very interesting thing to think about in general. So here's what he wrote and let's think about what he's saying. He says: Here at Penn Medical School, we have a nice teaching program that stimulates the ion fluxes across a generic cell, --So the ion flux is just the movement of the ions across the membrane-- including that due to the sodium potassium pump and that which arises from the resting permeabilities of the membrane. So the resting permeabilities is how easy it is for these ions to go through the membrane. And we'll talk more about that in a second. And the resting permeabilities of the membrane to sodium, potassium, chloride, et cetera. One option our program gives students is to change the pump stoichiometry from three to two. So when he's talking about pump stoichiometry from three to two, he's just talking about they're changing the ratios. So they change it from 3:2 to 2:2. So what that means is, they have a simulation program that says, well, what if the sodium potassium pump, instead of pumping three sodiums out for every two potassium it pumps in, what if it was even? What if it was two sodiums and two potassiums? And based on my explanation of why we have this potential difference, that should not lead to a potential difference if the main reason was the stoichiometry-- the ratio of sodium being pumped to the potassium being pumped in. But he goes on to say: They could change it to 2:2 in the simulation. As a result of this maneuver, the membrane potential changes from its normal value of about -80 millivolts-- and they measure that. They take the voltage here minus the voltage there so that you get a negative number. This is more positive. It's a larger number. So it changes from -80 millivolts to about -78 millivolts. So what he's saying is, if you change this from three and two-- three sodiums for every two potassiums that get pumped in-- if you change that to 2:2, it actually doesn't change the potential that much. You still have a more positive environment outside than you have inside. So that leads to the question-- then why do we have the potential if the stoichiometry of this ratio is not the main cause? So it says, it changes a little bit. The potential difference becomes a little bit less. The cell swells a few percentage and then everything stabilizes. So then he goes on to write: So while it is true that the normal stoichiometry of the pump does have a slight negative influence on the membrane potential-- that's just the membrane potential, the voltage across the membrane-- the imbalance in the pump stoichiometry is not the main reason for the large negative membrane potential of the cell. Rather, the main-- let me underline this-- the main reason is the concentration gradients established by the pump in combination with the fact that the resting cell membrane is highly permeable to potassium and only slightly permeable to sodium. So we said in the last video-- or the first video on the sodium potassium pump-- we said there were channels that the sodium could go through and there's also channels that the potassium could go through. And now what he's saying is that the main cause of the potential difference isn't this ratio, it's the fact that the membrane is highly permeable to potassium. So this is very permeable. Potassium can get out if it wants to, much easier than it is for sodium to get in. So what that happens-- even if this was a 2:2 ratio-- it's actually a 3:2, but even if this was a 2:2 ratio, even though this environment is more positive, you're just more likely to have to potassium ions down here bump in just the right way to get across and get to the other side, go against its chemical gradient, right, because you have a higher concentration of potassium here than over here. So you're more likely to have a potassium bump in just the right way to get through this channel and get out-- than you are to have a sodium be able to go the opposite direction. And that's what makes this environment. So you have more potassium coming outside because of this permeability than sodium coming inside-- and that's the main cause of the potential difference between the outside and the inside. And so thank you, Steven Baylor, for that correction. Very interesting.",science_biology_human-biology
" I made a claim that for this sequence-- and this was in a previous video-- that for this sequence right over here that can be defined explicitly in this way, that the limit of the sequence-- and so I can write this as negative 1 to the n plus 1 over n. That's one way of defining our sequence explicitly-- the limit of this as n approaches infinity is equal to 0. And it seems that way. As n gets larger and larger and larger, even though the numerator oscillates between negative 1 and 1, it seems like it will get smaller and smaller and smaller. But I didn't prove it, and that's what I want to do in this video. In order to prove it, this is going to be true if and only if for any epsilon greater than 0, there is a capital M greater than 0 such that if lowercase n, if our index is greater than capital M, then the nth term in our sequence is going to be within epsilon of our limit, within epsilon of 0. So what does that say? That says, hey, give me-- our limit is 0. Let me do this in a new color. So our limit right over here is 0. That's our limit. So our limit right over here is-- we're saying the sequence is converging to 0. What we're saying is, give us an epsilon around 0. So let's say that this right over here is 0 plus epsilon. That is 0 plus epsilon. The way I've drawn it here looks like epsilon would be 0.5. This would be 0 minus epsilon. Let me make it a little bit neater. So this would be zero minus epsilon. So this is negative epsilon, 0 minus epsilon, 0 plus epsilon. Our limit in this case, or our claim of a limit, is 0. Now, this is saying for any epsilon, we need to find an M such that if n is greater than M, the distance between our sequence and our limit is going to be less than epsilon. So if the distance between our sequence and our limit is less than epsilon, that means that the value of our sequence for a given n is going to be within these two bounds. It's got to be in this range right over here that I'm shading above a certain n. So if I pick an n right over here, it looks like anything larger than that is going to be the case that we're going to be within those bounds. But how do we prove it? Well, let's just think about what needs to happen for this to be true. So what needs to be happen for a sub n minus 0, the absolute value of a sub n minus 0, what needs to be true for this to be less than epsilon? Well, this is another way of saying that the absolute value of a sub n has to be less than epsilon. And a sub n is just this business right here, so it's another way of saying that the absolute value of negative 1 to the n plus 1 over n has to be less than epsilon, which is another way of saying, because this negative 1 to the n plus 1, this numerator just swaps us between a negative and a positive version of 1 over n. But if you take the absolute value of it, this is always just going to be positive. So this is the same thing as 1 over n, as the absolute value of 1 over n has to be less than epsilon. Now, n is always going to be positive. n starts at 1 and goes to infinity. So this value is always going to be positive. So this is saying the same thing that 1 over n has to be less than epsilon in order for this stuff to be true. And now we can take the reciprocal of both sides. And if you take the reciprocal of both sides of an inequality, you would have that n-- if you take the reciprocal of both sides of an inequality, you swap the inequality. So for this to be true, n has to be greater than 1 over epsilon. And we essentially have proven it now. So now we've said, look, for this particular sequence, you give me any epsilon, and I'm going to set M to be 1 over epsilon. Because if n is greater than M, which is 1 over epsilon, then we know that this right over here is going to be true. That is going to be true. So the limit does definitely exist. And so over here, for this particular epsilon, it looks like we've picked 0.5 or 1/2 as our epsilon. So as long as n is greater than 1 over 1/2, which is 2, so in this case we could say, look, you gave me 1/2. My M is going to be a function of epsilon. It's going to be defined for any epsilon you give me greater than 0. So here, 1 over 1/2 is right over here. I'm going to make my M right over here. And you see it is indeed the case that my sequence is within the range as we passed for any n greater than 2. So for n is equal to 3 it's in the range. For n is equal to 4 it's in the range. For n equals 5-- and it keeps going and going. And we're not just taking our word for it. We've proven it right over here. So we've made the proof. You give me any other any epsilon, I said M is equal to 1 over that thing. And so for n greater than that, this is going to be true. So this is definitely the case. This sequence converges to 0.",math_calculus-2_cs2-series
" A couple of videos ago, we learned that if we started with solid water or ice at a reasonably low temperature-- maybe this temperature right here is minus 10 degrees Celsius. And we can deal with Celsius when we're dealing with these phase changes, because we really just care about the difference in temperature, and not necessarily the absolute temperature. So one degree in Celsius is the same thing is one degree in Kelvin so the differences are the same whether you're dealing with Celsius or Kelvin. So we're starting with minus 10 degree Celsius ice or solid water. And we learned that as you heat it up, as you add heat energy to the water, the temperature goes up. The molecules, at least while they're in that ice lattice network, they just start vibrating. And their average kinetic energy goes up until we get to zero degrees. Which is the melting point of water. And at zero degrees, we already learned something interesting happens. The added heat in the system does not increase the temperature of the ice anymore. At least over that little period right here. What's happening is that heat energy is being used to kind of break the lattice structure. To add potential energy to the ice. Or essentially melt it. So for it here, right here, we're ice. Right at this point, we're zero degree ice. And then as we add more and more heat we get to zero degree water. So at zero degrees, you can either have water or ice. And if you have water, to turn it into ice, you have to take heat out of it. And if you have ice, and you want to turn it into water, you have to put heat into it. And then the heat is used again to warm up the water at some rate. And then at 100 degrees, which is the boiling point of water, right here, a similar phase change happens. Where the increased heat is not used to increase the temperature of the water, it's used to put potential energy into the system. So the water molecules are forced away from each other. The same way that if I'm forced away from the planet Earth, I have potential energy because I can fall back to the earth. Similarly, they have the potential energy of falling back to each other. But this energy, right here is the energy necessary to vaporize the water. Right here you have 100 degree water, 100 degree liquid. And here you have 100 degree vapor, water vapor. And then as you add more and more heat, once again it increases the temperature. But you, Sal, I already learned this a few videos ago, I have the intuition. But I want to deal with real numbers. I want to know exactly how much heat is required for these different things to happen. And for that, we can get these numbers. And these are specific to the different states of water. If you looked up any other element or molecule, you would have different values for these numbers we're going to be dealing with right now. But this first number right here is the heat of fusion. And this is the amount of heat that's required to fuse 100 degree water into 100 degree ice. Or the amount of energy you have to take out of the water. So this distance right here, or along this axis, is 333 joules. If you're going in the the leftward direction, you have to take that much out of the system to turn into ice. If you're going in the rightward direction, you have to add that much to turn into water. So heat of fusion. It's called the heat of fusion because when you fuse something together you make it solid. So it could also be considered the heat of melting. Just two different words for the same, thing depending on what direction you going. The important thing is the number, 333. Similarly, you have the heat of vaporization. 2257 joules per gram. That's this distance along this axis right here. So if you had one gram of 100 degree liquid water and you wanted to turn it into one gram of 100 degree liquid vapor. And in all of this, we're assuming that nothing silly is happening to the pressure, that we're under constant pressure. You would have to put 2257 joules into the system. If you had 100 degree vapor and you wanted to condense it, you would have to take that much energy out of the system. OK, fine, you know how much energy is required for the phase changes. But what about these parts right here? How much energy is required to warm up a gram of ice by one degree Celsius or Kelvin? And for that we look at the specific heat. It takes 2 joules of energy to warm up 1 gram 1 degree Kelvin. When water is in the solid state. When it's in the liquid state, it takes about double that. It takes about 4 joules per gram to raise it 1 degree Kelvin. And when you're in the vapor state, it's actually more similar to the solid state. So given what we know now, we can actually figure out how much energy it would take to go from minus 10 degree ice to 110 degree vapor. Let's work this out. So the first thing we're going to be doing is, we're going to be going from minus 10 degree ice to zero degree ice. So we're going to go 10 degrees. We have to figure out how much heat does it take to warm up ice by 10 degrees. So the heat is going to be equal to the change in temperature. So actually let me write the specific heat first. So 2.05 joules per gram Kelvin. Oh, and I should tell you, we can't different values for the amount of ice we're warming up to vapor, so let's say we're dealing with 200 grams. So it'll be the specific heat times the number of grams we're warming up of ice times the change in temperature that we're trying to get. So, times 10 degrees Kelvin. Le'ts just say it's a 10 degrees Kelvin change, it doesn't matter if we're using Kelvin or Celsius. I could have written a Celsius here. Let's put Celsius right there. So what is that equal to? Get the calculator. Clear it out. 2.05 times 200 times times 10 is equal to 4,100 joules. Let me do this in a different color. This is 4,100 joules. Fair enough. Now, so what we've done is just this part right here. This distance right here is 4,100 joules. Now we have to turn that zero degree ice into zero degree water. And for that we use the heat of fusion. We're adding that amount of heat. It's 333.5 joules per gram. So that's equal to 335.55 joules per gram times, we have 200 grams of ice that we're trying to melt. So that is what? So let me get the calculator out. So I have 335.55 times 200 is equal to 67,110. Let me do it in that color so can sum them up at the end. 67,110 joules to melt the water. Or take it from ice to water. Now, we have to go from, and this is the big one. We have to go from zero degree water to 100 degree water. Or liquid water. This is in the liquid state. So now we take the specific heat of water which was 4.178. For some reason I'm thinking it's 4.176 but it doesn't matter. So it's 4.178. I might off a little bit on that number, but that digit is not that significant. Joules per gram Celsius times 200 grams times 100 degrees Celsius. And notice, the Celsius and the Celsius cancel out. The grams and the grams cancel out. So we are left with joules, which is what we want. We want to know how much heat or how much energy we're adding to the system. Let me get the calculator out. So this stage is going to be 4.178 times 200 times 100 is equal to 83,560 joules. Does that look about right? Let's see. 4 times 200 is 800, 800 times 100; yeah, that's about right. Now, we're dealing with 100 degree water vapor, and we have to turn that 100 degree water vapor to 110 degree vapor. So we use the specific heat of vapor. 1.89 joules per gram Kelvin. 1Multiplied by the amount of vapor we're dealing with, 200 1grams. That obviously doesn't change. 1We're not adding or taking away mass from the system. 1Times the temperature change, times 10. 1So what is that? 1Let me get the calculator out again. 1So we're dealing with a 10 degree change. 110 degree Celsius times 200 times 1.89 is equal to 3,780. 1And I just realized, I made a horrible mistake. 1It's not an irrevocable mistake, otherwise I would 1rerecord the video. 1But I just figured out the amount of energy to take it 1from zero degree water to 100 degree water, which is this 1energy right here. 1And now I just calculated how much energy to go from 100 1degree vapor to 110 degree vapor. 1Which is this right here, that distance right here. 1I forgot to figure out how much energy to turn that 100 1degree water into 100 degree vapor. 1So that's key. 1So I really should have done that up here before I 1calculated the vapor. 1But I'll do it down here. 1So to do 100 degree water to 100 degree vapor. 1That's this step right here, this is the phase change. 1I multiply the heat of vaporization, which is 2,257 1joules per gram times 200 grams. And 1this is equal to 451,400. 1I'll do it in that blue color. 1451,400 joules. 1So this piece right here is 451,000 for our sample of 200 1grams. This piece right here was 83,000 joules. 1This piece right here was 3,780 joules. 1So to know the total amount of energy, the total amount of 1heat that we had to put in the system to go from minus 10 1degree ice all the way to 110 degree vapor, we just add up 1all of the energies we had to do in all of these steps. 1Let's see. 1And I'll do them in order this time. 1So to go from minus 10 degree ice to zero degree ice. 1Of course we have 200 grams of it. 1It was 4,100. 1Plus the 67,000. 1I'm just doing this off the screen. 1So plus 67,110. 1Plus 83,000. 1That's to go from zero degree water to 100 degree water. 1Plus 83,560. 1So we're at 154,000 right now just to get 1to 100 degree water. 1And then we need to turn that 100 degree water into 100 1degree vapor. 1So you add the 451,000. 1So, plus 451,400 is equal to 606. 1And then finally, we're at 100 degree vapor, and we want to 1convert that to 110 degree vapor. 1So it's another 3,700 joules. 1So plus 3,780 is equal to 609,950 joules. 1So this whole thing when we're dealing with 200 grams, when 1you're going from minus 10 to 110. 1And remember, this is for 200 grams. It 1took us 609,950 joules. 1Or 609 kilojoules to do this. 1So that by itself is an interesting thing. 1You might think, wow, this is a huge number. 1But actually, it turns out joules isn't a lot of work. 1Kilojoules starts to become a little bit interesting. 1You might realize, 200 grams of ice, that's about half a 1pound of ice. 1So to take half a pound of ice and warm it up on your stove 1would take 609 kilojoules of heat to do that. 1So that's something that you probably could do on your 1stove at home.",science_ap-chemistry_states-of-matter-and-intermolecular-forces-ap
" -  Dividing by 10, a lot like multiplying by 10, creates a pattern with numbers. So let's dig in and look at dividing by 10 and look at happens when we divide by 10 and see if we can figure out that pattern and maybe even how it relates to the pattern for multiplying by 10. Let's take a fairly simple one to start. Let's say something like 30 divided by 10. One way to think about this is we're taking the number 30 and we're dividing it into groups of 10. So let's see how many groups of 10 it takes to make 30. One group of 10 is 10, so that's not enough, plus a second group is 20, plus a third group is 30. So 30 can be thought of as 10 plus 10 plus 10, or three groups of 10. So if we divide 30 by 10, divide 30 into groups of 10, we end up with three groups. Let's try another one, maybe something slightly trickier, maybe let's go with 110 divided by 10. And again, we're dividing, we're taking 110 and dividing it into groups of 10. So let's see how many groups of 10 it takes to get to 110. Here's one 10, plus another is 20, 30, 40, 50, another 10 gets us to 60, 70, 80, we're getting closer, 90, 100, and 110. So this right here is how many groups of 10 it takes us to get to 110. So let's see how many groups is that. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, our solution is 11. If we have 110 and we divide it into groups of 10, we end up with 11 groups. Let's look at these first two, let's pause here and see if we see a pattern. 30 divide by 10 was three, 110 divided by 10 was 11, so what happened to the 30 in the 110 to get these quotients? And what happened is the zero, the zero on the end was taken off. Our solution is the same, but with the zero taken off the end. Here again, the solution is the same with a zero taken off the end. And if we remember for multiplication, it was the opposite. If we had two times 10 instead of dividing, times 10, our solution was 20, or two, our original number, with a zero added to the end. Remember, in another one, something like 13 times 10, our product, our solution is a 13, the original number, with a zero added to the end. So in multiplication, when we multiply by 10, we add a zero to our whole number at the end, and when we divide, we do the opposite by 10, we take off a zero from the end of our whole number. So knowing that pattern, let's try one more, maybe one where we don't work out all the 10s, but just try to use the pattern to solve it. If we had somethig like, say, 7,000 divided by 10, well, our solution is going to be 7,000 but with a zero taken off of the end because we're dividing by 10, so instead of 7,000 we would have 700. 7,000 divided into groups of 10 would be 700 groups of 10, so our solution is 700. Let's take this all a step further and let's think about what dividing by 10 is doing to these numbers, to 30, to 110, to 7,000, in terms of their place value. So here's a place value chart. Let's use it to look at one of the numbers we already tried, something like 30. And when we divided 30 by 10, remember what happened to the three, instead of being three 10s, our solution was three ones. The three moved one place value to the right, and the zero really did too, it would move after a decimal, which would be 3.0, which is the same as three, which is the reason we didn't need to write that zero, the reason that we could cross it off. So our number, instead of being three 10s, when we divided by 10, became three ones. Let's look at a little bit trickier of one. We also tried 7,000, so that would be seven thousands, zero hundreds, zero 10s, and zero ones, and when we divided by 10, our seven in our thousands place became seven hundreds, and the zero hundreds became zero 10s, and zero 10s became zero ones. And that last zero we were able to cross off and move to after the decimal. So 7,000 divided by 10 was 700. Again, everything moved one place value to the right. So there's two ways to think about dividing by 10. We could either say you drop a zero off the end, or we could say that you move every digit one place value to the right. Let's think about it again in terms of place value with a new number, let's try something like 630. If we divide 630 by 10, we're going to move everything one place value to the right, so the six hundreds will become six 10s, three 10s will become three ones, and the zero ones will move after the decimal. So we can say that 630 divided by 10 is equal to 63, or six 10s and three ones. So again, two ways to think about dividing by 10. Either we can cross off a zero, or we move every digit, each digit one place value to the right.",math_arithmetic-home_arith-place-value
" A human body has 5 liters of blood, 40% of which is red blood cells. Each red blood cell has a volume of approximately 90 times 10 to the negative 15 liters.

We have 5 liters. And then they tell us that 40% of that is red blood cells. So if we take the 5 liters and we multiply by 40%, this expression right here gives us the total volume of the red blood cells, 40% of our total volume of blood. Now this is the total volume of red blood cells. And we divide by the volume of each red blood cell. Then we're going to get the number of red blood cells. So let's do that. Let's divide by the volume of each red blood cell. So the volume of each red blood cell is 90 times 10 to the negative 15 liters. So let's see if we can simplify. So one thing that we can feel good about is that the units actually do cancel out. We have liters in the numerator, liters in the denominator, so we're going to get just a pure number, which is what we want. We just want how many red blood cells are actually in the body. So let's just focus the numbers here. So 5 times 40%-- well 40% is the same thing as 0.4. So let me write that down. This is the same thing as 0.4. 5 times 0.4 is 2. So our numerator simplifies to 2. And in the denominator, we have 90 times 10 to the negative 15, which definitely is not in scientific notation. It looks like it, but remember, in order to be in scientific notation, this number has to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. It's clearly not less than 10. But we can convert this to scientific notation very easily. 90 is the same thing as 9 times 10, or you could even say 9 times 10 to the first. And then you multiply that times 10 to the negative 15. And then this simplifies to 9 times-- let's add these two exponents-- 10 to the negative 14. And now we can actually divide. And let's simplify this division a little bit. This is going to be the same thing as 2/9 times 1 to t over 10 to the negative 14. Well what's 1 over 10 to the negative 14? Well that's just 10 to the 14. So this right over here is just the same thing as 10 to the 14. Now you might say, OK, we just have to figure out what 2/9 is and we're done. We've written this in scientific notation. But you might have already realized, look, 2/9 is not greater than or equal to 1. How can we make this greater than or equal to 1? Well we could multiply it by 10. If we multiply this by 10, then we've got to divide this by 10 to not change the value of this expression. But let's do that. So I'm going to multiply this by 10, and I'm going to divide this by 10. So I haven't changed. I've multiplied and divided by 10. So this is equal to 20/9 times 10 to the 14th divided by 10 is 10 to the 13th power. So what's 20/9? This is going to give us a number that is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10. So let's figure it out. And I think they said round our answer to two decimal places. So let's do that. So 20 divided by 9-- 9 doesn't go into 2. It does go into 20 two times. 2 times 9 is 18. Subtract. Get a remainder of 2. I think you see where this show is going to go. 9 goes into 20 two times. 2 times 9 is 18. We're just going to keep getting 2's. So we get another 2, bring down a 0. Nine goes into 20 two times. So this thing right over here is really 2.2 repeating. But they said round to two decimal places, so this is going to be equal to 2.22 times 10 to the 13th power.",math_algebra-basics_alg-basics-expressions-with-exponents
" There's a new reality television program, and it's called the Blue-- I should probably write it in blue-- but it's called the Blue Forehead Room. And what they do in this reality television program-- and you'll have to bear with me, because the show probably wouldn't be that interesting to watch-- but it's interesting to predict what happens. What they do is, they take a room. They'll call it the blue forehead room. And let's see, that's kind of a top view of the room. And let's say there's a door here. None of this is relevant to the actual problem. This is the door, right there. And what they do is they get 100 perfect logicians to sit in this room, in a circle. So they're all sitting in a circle in this room. Now, before the game even starts, before they even enter the room the first time, the logicians are told two things. They're told, One: that at least one of you has your forehead painted blue. At least one of you has your forehead-- And they all get their foreheads painted, so that obviously if you're the only guy who has your forehead painted. But you just don't know what color it is. So all of them have different color foreheads. Or, we don't know. But all they're told is, obviously I've painted your forehead. At least one of the people in the room that you will enter will have their forehead painted blue. And then they're also told that as soon as you deduce that your forehead is blue, you need to leave the room. And what's going to happen is-- and it's very important that I set this up properly. They're all outside of the room. No-one's inside the room. And let's say they're blindfolded. And while they're blindfolded, they essentially have the thing painted onto their forehead. So they can't see the paintbrush or anything. So they really don't know what's on their forehead. And then after that, they all enter the room. And they all sit in a circle like this, so that they can all look at each other. And let's say when they enter, the lights are off. So the lights are off, and then the protocol is that the lights will be turned on, and then they can all look around at each other. There's no reflective surfaces. They can't look into each other's eyes and try to see the reflection. No tricks like that. There are no mirrors in this room. Nothing like that. All they can do is look at each other. So, just as an example, let's say that this is me right here. As soon as the lights get turned on the first time, I'll be able to look at all the other people in the room. And I could see, it'll be pretty obvious to me if anyone has a blue forehead. Maybe that guy has one, that guy doesn't. I don't know, right? And I can see them. I can't see my own forehead. And what happens is, then they will turn off the lights, and the way they're going to do it is you have to leave the room after you have realized that you have a blue forehead. So for example, let's say I enter into the room, and because I'm a perfect logician I see things that allow me to perfectly deduce that I have a blue forehead. Then what they're going to do is they're going to turn off the lights again. And then, if I know that I have a blue forehead while the lights are turned off, I would leave the room. And then when they turn the lights back on, I'd be gone. So there would be no Sal here. So let's say there were 100 before, then there would be 99 guys sitting in the room. Right? As soon as I realize I have a blue forehead, when the lights get turned off, I leave. And just remember these are perfect logicians. So everyone in the room. And not only are they all perfect logicians, but they all know that everyone else is a perfect logician. So, everyone is also told, and this is true, everyone is a perfect logician. Which means they have infallible powers of logic. So my question to you-- Just remember, I have each of these perfect logicians. We set them up outside of the room, paint their foreheads. They're blindfolded. They have no clue. Then we have all of them walk into a dark room, sit in a circle like this. And then what we tell them is, as soon as you realize that you have a blue forehead, as soon as you have a blue forehead, you have to leave the room. Now my question to you is, let's say that we've actually painted everybody's forehead blue. What happens? So remember, this is what we've told each of the people. Right? As soon as you realize your forehead is blue, you leave the room. And now I've just asked you, the producers like to really play with these logicians. They've actually painted everybody's forehead blue. So when everyone goes in the room the first time, what's going to happen? Let's say I'm one of the logicians. This is me right here. As soon as I open my eyes, I'm going to see 99 other fellow logicians with blue foreheads. And then, maybe I can somehow deduce something about my own. I don't think you can. And the lights will go off. And then if I haven't deduced anything about my own blueness of my forehead, then they'll turn the lights back on. And then maybe some other guy will have left. I don't know. Or maybe not. And then I'll see the same 99 guys again. And that'll just keep occurring until something happens. And my question to you is what happens? When? And why? I'm thinking whether I should give you a hint right now. Well let me tell it to you this way. That's the problem. You should be able to solve it. And just so you know where this came from, if I remember correctly I think this was on a computer science exam I had at MIT. So just so you know, this isn't just for fun. I don't want to go into all of the applications that this type of problem can apply to, because that by itself would be a bit of a hint. So if you don't want a hint, turn off the video now or pause it. If you do want a hint, I'm about to give it to you. So my hint is-- and remember turn this off if you don't want to hint-- but the hint is what happens when there are less than 100 people. So I gave the situation where we have 100 logicians. But this problem is actually a lot easier if you try it with a smaller number. Anyway I'll see you in the solution video.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_puzzles
" In the last video, we proved that the sum of all of the positive integers up to and including n can be expressed as n times n plus 1 over 2. And we proved that by induction. What I want to do in this video is show you that there's actually a simpler proof for that. But it's not by induction, so it wouldn't be included in that video. But I'll show you that it exists, just so you know that induction isn't the only way to prove it. So we define that function S of n as the sum of all of the positive integers up to and including n. So this is equal to, by definition, 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus, all the way to plus n minus 1 plus n. So it's the sum of all of the integers up to and including n. This is how we're defining it. Well, we can rewrite it again. We can say that the sum, S of n-- we could just rewrite this same thing, but we could rewrite it in a different order. We could say that this is the same thing as n plus n minus 1 plus n minus 2 plus, all the way down to plus 2 plus 1. Now, what does this do for us? Well, we can actually add these two rows. If we add S of n plus S of n, we're going to get 2 times this sum, so we're just adding on the left. And then we can also add on the right. So we're just adding this sum twice, but what's interesting is how we're going to add it. We're going to add this term to this term, this term to this term, because we're really just trying to add these two things. And we can pick any way we want to add them. So 1 plus n is going to be n plus 1. And then we're going to add-- let me do it in pink-- 2 plus n minus 1. So what's 2 plus n minus 1? Let me write it over here. 2 plus n minus 1. It's the same thing as 2 plus n minus 1, which is the same thing as n plus 1. 2 minus 1 is just 1. So this is also going to be n plus 1. And then this term over here, 3 plus n minus 2, or n minus 2 plus 3. Once again, that's going to be n plus 1. And you're going to do that for every term all the way until you get over here, n minus 1 plus 2. That's also going to be n plus 1. And then finally, you have n plus 1 right over here. Plus n plus 1. So what's this whole sum going to be? Well, how many of these n plus 1's do we have? Well, we have n of them, for every term in each of these sums. So this is 1, 2, 3, count all the way to n. You have n of these terms. So you have n n plus 1's. So if you add something to itself n times, or if you have something n times right over here, this is exactly equivalent to n times n plus 1. So 2 times that sum of all the positive integers up to and including n is going to be equal to n times n plus 1. So if you divide both sides by 2, we get an expression for the sum. So the sum of all the positive integers up to and including n is going to be equal to n times n plus 1 over 2. So here was a proof where we didn't have to use induction. It's really kind of a pure algebraic proof.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-3
" We need to factor negative 12f squared minus 38f, plus 22. So a good place to start is just to see if, is there any common factor for all three of these terms? When we look at them, they're all even. And we don't like a negative number out here. So let's divide everything, or let's factor out a negative 2. So this expression right here is the same thing as negative 2 times-- what's negative 12f squared divided by negative 2? It's positive 6f squared. Negative 38 divided by negative 2 is positive 19, so it'll be positive 19f. And then 22 divided by negative 22-- oh, sorry, 22 divided by negative 2 is negative 11. So we've simplified it a bit. We have the 6f squared plus 19f, minus 11. We'll just focus on that part right now. And the best way to factor this thing, since we don't have a 1 here as the coefficient on the f squared, is to factor it by grouping. So we need to look for two numbers whose product is 6 times negative 11. So two numbers, so a times b, needs to be equal to 6 times negative 11, or negative 66. And a plus b needs to be equal to 19. So let's try a few numbers here. So let's see, 22, I'm just thinking of numbers that are roughly 19 apart, because they're going to be of different signs. So 22 and 3, I think will work. Right. If we take 22 times negative 3, that is negative 66, and 22 plus negative 3 is equal to 19. And the way I kind of got pretty close to this number is, well, you know, they're going to be of different signs, so the positive versions of them have to be about 19 apart, and that worked out. 22 and negative 3. So now we can rewrite this 19f right here as the sum of negative 3f and 22f. That's the same thing as 19f. I just kind of broke it apart. And, of course, we have the 6f squared and we have the minus 11 here. Now, you're probably saying, hey Sal, why did you put the 22 here and the negative 3 there? Why didn't you do it the other way around? Why didn't you put the 22 and then the negative 3 there? And my main motivation for doing it, I like to put the negative 3 on the same side with the 6 because they have the common factor of the 3. I like to put the 22 with the negative 11, they have the same common factor of 11. So that's why I decided to do it that way. So now let's do the grouping. And, of course, you can't forget this negative 2 that we have sitting out here the whole time. So let me put that negative 2 out there, but that'll just kind of hang out for awhile. But let's do some grouping. So let's group these first two. And then we're going to group this-- let me get a nice color here-- and then we're going to group this second two. Well, that's almost an identical color. Let me do it in this purple color. And then we can group that second two right there. So these first two, we could factor out a negative 3f, so it's negative 3f times-- 6f squared divided by negative 3f is negative 2f. And then negative 3f divided by negative 3f is just positive f. Actually, a better way to start, instead of factoring out a negative 3f, let's just factor out 3f, so we don't have a negative out here. We could do it either way. But if we just factor out a 3f, 6f squared divided by 3f is 2f. And then negative 3f divided by 3f is negative 1. So that's what that factors into. And then that second part, in that dark purple color, can factor out an 11. And if we factor that out, 22f divided by 11 is 2f, and negative 11 divided by 11 is negative 1. And, of course, once again, you have that negative 2 hanging out there. Now, inside the parentheses, we have two terms, both of which have 2f minus 1 as a factor. So we can factor that out. This whole thing is just an exercise in doing the reverse distributive property, if you will. So let's factor that out, so you have 2f minus 1, times this 3f, and then times that plus 11. Let me do that in the same shade of purple right over there. And you know, you can distribute it if you like. 2f minus 1 times 3f will give you this term, 2f f minus 1 times 11 will give you that term. And we can't forget that we still have that negative 2 hanging out outside. I want to change the colors on it. And we're done factoring it. Negative 12f squared minus 38f, plus 22 is negative 2 times 2f minus 1, times 3f plus 11.",math_algebra_quadratics-multiplying-factoring
" - Omojobi is 220 centimeters tall. He wanted to fill up his pool so that the water level would be as high as he is tall. So that the water level, I guess, would be 220 centimeters tall. The water level rose by six centimeters each minute and reached the desired height after 20 minutes. Graph the pool's water level, in centimeters, as a function of time, in minutes. Well, they do tell us one interesting thing. They say that the water level reached the desired height after 20 minutes. And we know what the desired height is, the desired height is to be as tall as, or to be as deep as he is tall, or as high as he is tall. And that is 220 centimeters tall. So they're telling us essentially that the water level of the pool after 20 minutes is 220 centimeters, so we can plot that. So after 20 minutes, so we can plot that point right there. After 20 minutes, we are at 220 centimeters. So we would be right there. Now the other question is where would we put this point? We need another data point in order to define a line. And so they tell us that the water, you might be tempted to say, ""Okay, maybe the water level was ""at zero to begin with,"" but they didn't tell us that. Maybe when he started filling the pool there was already some water in there. So we have to be a little bit more careful. But they do give us some information. The water level rose by six centimeters each minute, it rose by six centimeters each minute. So at 20 minutes, we know we're at 220. And if we rose six centimeters each minute, where would we have been, let's say 10 minutes ago? So, where would we have been at time 10? So, every 10 minutes, if the water level is rising six centimeters a minute, it would be rising 60 centimeters every 10 minutes. So 10 minutes ago, we would be 60 centimeters less. So 60 centimeters less than 220. That's 20 centimeters less, that's 40 centimeters less, that's 60 centimeters less. So, if you go back in time 10 minutes, you would be 60 centimeters shallower, or less high, and 220 minus 60 is 160. Now, I think I'm done. I think this describes it. Now let's see if it makes sense. This is telling us that at time zero there was, before he started filling it, there was already 100 centimeters in his pool. And then after 20 minutes, he's done. And is that consistent with six centimeters a minute? Well, based on this, it took him 20 minutes to get to 220, but that's an incremental 120. To go from 100 to 220 is 120 more centimeters. So in 20 minutes, he got 120 centimeters. Well 120 centimeters divided by 20 minutes is six centimeters per minute. So this is looking good and we got it right.",math_algebra-home_alg-linear-eq-func
" So we're in the home stretch. Let's see if part C is true, and I'm running out of real estate. So let me copy and paste it actually. Actually, maybe I could do it over here to the left. I had some doodles here. Let me clear those out. So let's see if we can do it over here to the left. Part C. So we have this determit, and it's claiming that it equals 0, so we have to see if that's true. And so we can actually try to multiply these out and see if anything interesting happens, but we could even better leverage some of the algebra that we've already done for part A. In part A, we figured out that z minus z1 is equal to t times z2 minus z1. So this thing right over here, this is the same thing as t times z2 minus z1, and the reason why that's interesting is I have a z1 minus z1 here, so I'm starting to have similar things. And then this thing over here-- so if I take the conjugate of each of these, the conjugate of z minus the conjugate of z1, this is going to be equal to t times the conjugate of z2 minus the conjugate of z1. And I know that because when I do this, I'm swapping all of the signs on the imaginary parts of the complex numbers. So if you were to go through this entire process just swapping the imaginary parts of the complex number, the end result would have it's imaginary parts swapped, and that's exactly what we have over here. We have the imaginary parts swapped over here. So if you want to work it out, set this equal to A plus BI or set this equal to A1 plus B1, you can work it out, but I think it's a pretty intuitive idea that we're just making all of the-- we're just swapping the signs on all of the imaginary parts of each of these complex numbers. Now, with this said, this determit becomes pretty simple. This becomes t times z2 minus z1. This becomes t times the conjugate of z2 minus z1. This down here is z2 minus z1. And then this over here is the conjugate of z2 minus z1. And so what is this determit? It's going to be this times this. So it's t times z2 minus z1 times z2 minus z1 times the conjugate of those. So it's that times that minus this times this, so minus t z2 z1, z2 minus z1 times the conjugate of z2 minus the conjugate of z1. Now, this is exactly equal to this. These things are obviously going to cancel out, and we're clearly going to get 0. So C is also true. So the correct answers to this original problem were A, C, and D.",math_algebra-home_alg-complex-numbers
" So I have the function g of x is equal to 9 times 8 to the x minus 1 power. And it's defined for x being a positive-- or if x is a positive-- integer. If x is a positive integer. So we could say the domain of this function, or all the valid inputs here are positive integers. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, on and on and on. So this is an explicitly defined function. What I now want to do is to write a recursive definition of this exact same function. That given an x, it'll give the exact same outputs. So let's first just try to understand the inputs and outputs here. So let's make a little table. Let's make a table here. And let's think about what happens when we put in various x's into this function definition. So the domain is positive integers. So let's try a couple of them. 1, 2, 3, 4. And then see what the corresponding g of x is. g of x. So when x is equal to 1, g of x is 9 times 8 to the 1 minus 1 power, 9 times 8 to the 0 power, or 9 times 1. So g of x is going to be just 9. When x is 2, what's going to happen? It'll be 9 times 8 to the 2 minus 1. So that's the same thing as 9 times 8 to the 1st power. And that's just going to be 9 times 8. So that is 72. Actually let me just write it that way. Let me write it as just 9 times 8. 9 times 8. Then when x is equal to 3, what's going on here? Well this is going to be 3 minus 1 is 2. So it's going to be 8 squared. So it's going to be 9 times 8 squared. So we could write that as 9 times 8 times 8. I think you see a little bit of a pattern forming. When x is 4, this is going to be 8 to the 4 minus 1 power, or 9 to the 3rd power. So that's 9 times 8 times 8 times 8. So this gives a good clue about how we would define this recursively. Notice, if our first term, when x equals 1 is 9, every term after that is 8 times the preceding term. Is 8 times the preceding term. 8 times the preceding term. 8 times the preceding term. So let's define that as a recursive function. So first define our base case. So we could say g of x-- and I'll do this is a new color because I'm overusing the red. I like the blue. g of x. Well we can define our base case. It's going to be equal to 9 if x is equal to 1. g of x equals 9 if x equals 1. So that took care of that right over there. And then if it equals anything else it equals the previous g of x. So if we're looking at-- let's go all the way down to x minus 1, and then an x. So if this entry right over here is g of x minus 1, however many times you multiply the 8s and we have a 9 in front, so this is g of x minus 1. We know that g of x-- we know that this one right over here is going to be the previous entry, g of x minus 1. The previous entry times 8. So we could write that right here. Times 8. So for any other x other than 1, g of x is equal to the previous entry-- so it's g of-- I'll do that in a blue color-- g of x minus 1 times 8. If x is greater than 1, or x is integer greater than 1. Now let's verify that this actually works. So let's draw another table here. So once again, we're going to have x and we're going to have g of x. But this time we're going to use this recursive definition for g of x. And the reason why it's recursive is it's referring to itself. In its own definition, it's saying hey, g of x, well if x doesn't equal 1 it's going to be g of x minus 1. It's using the function itself. But we'll see that it actually does work out. So let's see... When x is equal to 1, so g of 1-- well if x equals 1, it's equal to 9. It's equal to 9. So that was pretty straightforward. What happens when x equals 2? Well when x equals 2, this case doesn't apply anymore. We go down to this case. So when x is equal to 2 it's going to be equivalent to g of 2 minus 1. Let me write this down. It's going to be equivalent to g of 2 minus 1 times 8, which is the same thing as g of 1 times 8. And what's g of 1? Well g of 1 is right over here. g of 1 is 9. So this is going to be equal to 9 times 8. Exactly what we got over here. And of course this was equivalent to g of 2. So let me write this. This is g of 2. Let me scroll over a little bit so I don't get all scrunched up. So now let's go to 3. Let's go to 3. And right now I'll write g of 3 first. So g of 3 is equal to-- we're going to this case-- it's equal to g of 3 minus 1 times 8. So that's equal to g of 2 times 8. Well what's g of 2? Well g of 2, we already figured out is 9 times 8. So it's equal to 9 times 8-- that's g of 2-- times 8 again. And so you see we get the exact same results. So this is the recursive definition of this function.",math_algebra-home_alg-sequences
" Let's see if we can get a little bit more practice and intuition of what cross products are all about. So in the last example, we took a cross b. Let's see what happens when we take b cross a. So let me erase some of this. I don't want to erase all of it because it might be useful to give us some intuition to compare. I'm going to keep that. Actually, I can erase this, I think. So the things I have drawn here, this was a cross b. Let me cordon it off so you don't get confused. So that was me using the right hand rule when I tried to do a cross b, and then we saw that the magnitude of this was 25, and n, the direction, pointed downwards. Or when I drew it here, it would point into the page. So let's see what happens with b cross a, so I'm just switching the order. b cross a. Well, the magnitude is going to be the same thing, right? Because I'm still going to take the magnitude of b times the magnitude of a times the sine of the angle between them, which was pi over 6 radians and then times some unit vector n. But this is going to be the same. When I multiply scalar quantities, it doesn't matter what order I multiply them in, right? So this is still going to be 25, whatever my units might have been, times some vector n. And we still know that that vector n has to be perpendicular to both a and b, and now we have to figure out, well, is it, in being perpendicular, it can either kind of point into the page here or it could pop out of the page, or point out of the page. So which one is it? And then we take our right hand out, and we try it again. So what we do is we take our right hand. I'm actually using my right hand right now, although you can't see it, just to make sure I draw the right thing. So in this example, if I take my right hand, I take the index finger in the direction of b. I take my middle finger in the direction of a, so my middle figure is going to look something like that, right? And then I have two leftover fingers there. Then the thumb goes in the direction of the cross product, right? Because your thumb has a right angle right there. That's the right angle of your thumb. So in this example, that's the direction of a, this is the direction of b, and we're doing b cross a. That's why b gets your index finger. The index finger gets the first term, your middle finger gets the second term, and the thumb gets the direction of the cross product. So in this example, the direction of the cross product is upwards. Or when we're drawing it in two dimensions right here, the cross product would actually pop out of the page for b cross a. So I'll draw it over. It would be the circle with the dot. Or if I were to draw it analogous to this, so this right here, that was a cross b. And then b cross a is the exact same magnitude, but it goes in the other direction. That's b cross a. It just flips in the opposite direction. And that's why you have to use your right hand, because you might know that, oh, something's going to pop in or out of the page, et cetera, et cetera, but you need to know your right hand to know whether it goes in or out of the page. Anyway, let's see if we can get a little bit more intuition of what this is all about because this is all about intuition. And frankly, I'll tell you, the cross product comes into use in a lot of concepts that frankly we don't have a lot of real-life intuition, with electrons flying through a magnetic field or magnetic fields through a coil. A lot of things in our everyday life experience, maybe if we were metal filings living in a magnetic field-- well, we do live in a magnetic field. In a strong magnetic field, maybe we would get an intuition, but it's hard to have as deep of an intuition as we do for, say, falling objects, or friction, or forces, or fluid dynamics even, because we've all played with water. But anyway, let's get a little bit more intuition. And let's think about why is there that sine of theta? Why not just multiply the magnitudes times each other and use the right hand rule and figure out a direction? What is that sine of theta all about? I think I need to clear this up a little bit just so this could be useful. So why is that sine of theta there? Let me redraw some vectors. I'll draw them a little fatter. So let's say that's a, that's a, this is b. b doesn't always have to be longer than a. So this is a and this is b. Now, we can think of it a little bit. We could say, well, this is the same thing as a sine theta times b, or we could say this is b sine theta times a. I hope I'm not confusing-- all I'm saying is you could interpret this as-- because these are just magnitudes, right? So it doesn't matter what order you multiply them in. You could say this is a sine theta times the magnitude of b, all of that in the direction of the normal vector, or you could put the sine theta the other way. But let's think about what this would mean. a sine theta, if this is theta. What is a sine theta? Sine is opposite over hypotenuse, right? So opposite over hypotenuse. So this would be the magnitude of a. Let me draw something. Let me draw a line here and make it a real line. Let me draw a line there, so I have a right angle. So what's a sine theta? This is the opposite side. So a sine theta is a, and sine of theta is opposite over hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the magnitude of a, right? So sine of theta is equal to this side, which I call o for opposite, over the magnitude of a. So it's opposite over the magnitude of a. So this term a sine theta is actually just the magnitude of this line right here. Another way you could-- let me redraw it. It doesn't matter where the vectors start from. All you care about is this magnitude and direction, so you could shift vectors around. So this vector right here, and you could call it this opposite vector, that's the same thing as this vector. That's the same thing as this. I just shifted it away. And so another way to think about it is, it is the component of vector a, right? We're used to taking a vector and splitting it up into x- and y-components, but now we're taking a vector a, and we're splitting it up into-- you can think of it as a component that's parallel to vector b and a component that is perpendicular to vector b. So a sine theta is the magnitude of the component of vector a that is perpendicular to b. So when you're taking the cross product of two numbers, you're saying, well, I don't care about the entire magnitude of vector a in this example, I care about the magnitude of vector a that is perpendicular to vector b, and those are the two numbers that I want to multiply and then give it that direction as specified by the right hand rule. And I'll show you some applications. This is especially important-- well, we'll use it in torque and we'll also use it in magnetic fields, but it's important in both of those applications to figure out the components of the vector that are perpendicular to either a force or a radius in question. So that's why this cross product has the sine theta because we're taking-- so in this, if you view it as magnitude of a sine theta times b, this is kind of saying this is the magnitude of the component of a perpendicular to b, or you could interpret it the other way. You could interpret it as a times b sine theta, right? Put a parentheses here. And then you could view it the other way. You could say, well, b sine theta is the component of b that is perpendicular to a. Let me draw that, just to hit the point home. So that's my a, that's my b. This is a, this is b. So b has some component of it that is perpendicular to a, and that is going to look something like-- well, I've run out of space. Let me draw it here. If that's a, that's b, the component of b that is perpendicular to a is going to look like this. It's going to be perpendicular to a, and it's going to go that far, right? And then you could go back to SOH CAH TOA and you could prove to yourself that the magnitude of this vector is b sine theta. So that is where the sine theta comes from. 1It makes sure that we're not just multiplying the vectors. 1It makes sure we're multiplying the components of 1the vectors that are perpendicular to each other to 1get a third vector that is perpendicular to both of them. 1And then the people who invented the cross product 1said, well, it's still ambiguous because it doesn't 1tell us-- there's always two vectors that are perpendicular 1to these two. 1One goes in, one goes out. 1They're in opposite directions. 1And that's where the right hand rule comes in. 1They'll say, OK, well, we're just going to say a convention 1that you use your right hand, point it like a gun, make all 1your fingers perpendicular, and then you know what 1direction that vector points in. 1Anyway, hopefully, you're not confused. 1Now I want you to watch the next video. 1This is actually going to be some physics on electricity, 1magnetism and torque, and that's essentially the 1applications of the cross product, and it'll give you a 1little bit more intuition of how to use it. 1See you soon.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-system-of-particles-and-rotational-motion

" In the last video we were able to set up this definite integral using the shell or the hollow cylinder method in order to figure out the volume of this solid of revolution. And so now let's just evaluate this thing. And really the main thing we have to do here is just to multiply what we have here out. So multiply this expression out. So this is going to be equal to-- I'll take the 2 pi out of the integral. 2 pi times the integral from 0 to 1. Let's see, 2 times the square root of x is 2-- I'll write it as 2 square roots of x. But I'll write it as 2x to the 1/2. It'll make it a little bit easier to take the antiderivative conceptually, or at least in our brain. So two times the square root of x is 2x to the 1/2. 2 times negative x squared is negative 2 x squared. And then we have negative x times the square root of x. Well, that's x to the first times x to the 1/2. That's going to be negative x to the 3/2 power. And then we have negative x times negative x squared that's going to be positive x to the third power. And all of that dx. And so now we're ready to take the antiderivative. So this is going to be equal to 2 pi times the antiderivative of all of this business evaluated at 1 and at 0. So the antiderivative of 2 times x to the 1/2 is going to be 2-- it's going to be-- let's see. We're going to take x to the 3/2 times 2/3. So it's going to be 4/3 x to the 3/2. And then for this term right over here it's going to be negative 2/3 x to the third. And you could take the derivative here to verify that you actually do get this. And then right over here, let's see, if we incremented this, you get x to the 5/2. And so we're going to want to multiply by 2/5. So minus-- let me do this in another color. Let's see, so this one right over here, it's going to be minus 2/5 x to the 5/2 power. Yep, that works out. And then finally you're going to have x to the fourth over 4 plus-- let me do that in a different color-- plus x to the fourth over 4. That's this term right over here. And now we just have to evaluate at 1 and 0. And 0, luckily, all of these terms end up being a 0. So that's nice and cancels out. And so we are just left with-- we're just-- [INAUDIBLE] cancel out. It just evaluates to 0. So this is just 2 pi times when you evaluate all this business at 1. So that's going to be 4/3 minus 2/3 minus 2/5 plus 1/4. And the least common multiple right over here looks like 60, so we're going to want to put all this over a denominator of 60. So it's going to be 2 pi times all of this business over a denominator of 60. And 4/3 is same thing as 80/60. Negative 2/3 is the same thing as negative 40/60. Negative 2/5 is the same thing as negative 24/60. And then 1/4 is the same thing as 15/60. So this is equal to-- and actually this will cancel over here, and you'll just get a 30 in your denominator. So in your denominator, you get a 30. And up here 80 minus 40 is 40. 40 minus 24 gets us to 16. 16 plus 15 is 31. So we get 31 times pi over 30 for the volume of the figure right over there.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-applications-definite-integrals
" -  In previous videos we talk about GDP as the market value of final goods and services produced in a country in a given time period, let's say in a given year and we gave the example of producing jeans where maybe the farmer helps produce the cotton and then the thread maker takes that cotton and makes thread and then the fabric maker takes the thread and makes fabric and then the jean maker takes the fabric and produces jeans and then the market value of those jeans was $50 and so, assuming all of this happened in one year, in the time period that we're measuring GDP for, then we would just count the $50, if we're looking at the final market value or the market value of final goods and services. You would say the GDP for at least for this component of the GDP from these jeans is $50 but I do wanna clarify that there are multiple ways that you can measure GDP and you could even think about it from a value added approach but the key idea is no matter how you measure it you should get to the same value, so let's think about the various actors here and what their value add was. So, first, let's think about the framer right over here. So, this is the farmer, my not so elegantly drawn rectangle around what he's doing. So, the farmer's value add is what? Well, before you just had some dirt and things and so, maybe you could say that the market value was zero and then he's able to produce something or she's able to produce something that now has a market value of $10, so their value add is $10. Now, from there, the cotton goes to the thread maker. The threader maker they take that $10 cotton, so this is thread maker, they take the $10 cotton and are able to produce $20 worth of thread? What is their value add? Value add here? Well, they took something worth $10 and they were able to do something to it to make it worth $20, so their value add is now another $10 and then, this is the thread maker, and then from there it goes to the fabric maker and I think you see where this is going, the fabric maker is this part of our process, fabric maker and their value add is what? Pause this video and think about it. Well, they take something worth $20 and they're to turn it into something that has a market value of $30, so their value add is also $10 and then last but not least, you have the jean company, so the jean manufacturer, I'll call them the jean producer, the jean producer, they take something that has a market value of $30 and they're able to sell it for $50, so their value add here, if you take something for 30 and you make it worth 50, then you've added $20 of value and so, the value added approach to GDP will just sum up these value adds, so this is going to be this $10 from the farmer plus the value add of the thread maker, plus $10 from the thread maker plus $10 from the fabric maker plus $20 from the jean maker and what will that all add up to? Well, that's all going to add up to 10 plus 10 is 20 plus 10 is 30 plus 20 is $50 and lucky for us that is added up to the same amount as we had before where we just looked at the market value of the final goods and services. Now, one benefit of the value added approach is that real supply chains are quite complex and things might be going from one country to another, they might as we've talked about in another video, the year might end right over here and so, when something is made in China and there's value add in China but then it's shipped to the US and some value add is placed on it and then it's shipped back to China or Mexico, you have to be careful to only count the value add in the country for which you are measuring the GDP. So, that's one useful way or one useful reason, or one way in which the value added approach might be useful. The key idea though is that you're getting to the same value. You should get to the same value as the market value of the final goods and services produced in a given time period.",economics-finance-domain_ap-macroeconomics_economic-iondicators-and-the-business-cycle
" -  So what we're gonna do in this video is several examples where we evaluate expressions with definite integrals and so right over here we have the definite integral from negative two to three of 2 f(x)dx plus the definite integral from 3 to seven of 3 f(x)dx and all we know about f(x) is the graph of y=f(x) from negative, from x equals negative six to x equals seven. They also give us the areas between f(x), y equals f(x) and the x axis. The negative areas show that our function is below the x axis and so given that, can we evaluate that and like always, pause the video and see if you can do it on your own. Well the first thing that my brain wants to do is I want to, I want to take these constants out of the integral because then once they're out and I'm just taking the straight up definite integrals of f(x), I can relate that to the areas over here and I know I can do that and this is a very common integration property and applies to definite and indefinite integrals but if I'm taking the integral of k f(x)dx, this is the same thing as k times the integral of f(x)dx. So let's just apply that property there which is really you're taking the scaler outside of the integral. To say this is going to be the same thing as two times the definite integral from negative two to three of f(x)dx plus three times the integral from three to seven of f(x)dx. All right. Now can we evaluate these things? So what is this going to be? The definite integral from negative two to three of f(x)dx. Well we can view that as the area between the curves y equals f(x) and the x axis, between x equals negative two and x equals three. So between x equals two and x equals three, they give us the area between y equals f(x) and the x axis. It is seven. So this thing over here is seven and then we have the integral from three to seven of f(x) so we're gonna go from three to seven and once again, well this is going to evaluate to a negative value because f(x) is below the x axis there and it's going to evaluate to negative three. So this is all going to be this is going to be two times seven so 14 plus, 14 plus three times negative three so plus negative nine and so 14 minus nine is equal to five. This is fun. Let's do more of these. All right. Okay, so here this first integral the integral from zero to five of f(x)dx, so this is pretty straightforward. This right over here, we're gonna go from zero to five. Zero to five and of f(x)dx, so we're talking about this area there which they tell us is four so that was pretty easy to evaluate and now we're gonna subtract, we're gonna subtract going from negative eight to negative four times 2f(x), well let's just take this two outside. So if we just take this two outside, then this just becomes the integral from negative eight to negative four of f(x) and so this thing, this thing right over here evaluates to five. It's this area they're talking about. So this is all going to simplify to four minus that two that we brought out, minus two times five. Times five, which is equal to let's see four minus 10 which is equal to negative six. All right. Let's do another one of these. So here I have the integral from negative seven to negative five so I'm going from negative seven to negative five which is, it's gonna be right around there so I want to find, I want to find this area right over here. So I want to find that area. That's that and then I'm gonna go from negative five to zero. So then this is going to be going from negative five to zero so it's gonna be all of that. Now there's a couple of ways you can think about doing it. You can assume I have some symmetry here and they don't tell it for sure but it looks very symmetric around x equals negative five so you could assume that this eight is split between these two regions but an easier way to do it is just to realize look, I went from negative seven to negative five and then from negative five to zero and I'm integrating the same thing. F(x)dx so this integral I can rewrite as the integral from negative seven so negative seven all the way to zero of f(x), f(x)dx and so really that's just going to be the net area between negative seven and zero and so we have the positive eight there so this is going to be equal to the positive eight and then we have the negative one there so minus one which is equal to seven.",math_old-integral-calculus_definite-integrals-intro-ic
" -  Let's now do a proof of the polynomial remainder theorem. Just to make the proof a little bit tangible, I'm going to start with the example that we saw in the video that introduced the polynomial remainder theorem. We saw that if you took three x squared minus four x plus seven and you divided by x minus one, you got three x minus one with the remainder of six. When we do polynomial long division, how do we know when we've got to our remainder? Well when we get to an expression that has a lower degree than the thing that is the divisor, the thing that we're dividing into the other thing. So in this example we could have re-written what we just did right over here as our f of x. Let me just write it right over here. So we could have said three x squared minus four x plus seven is equal to x minus one times the quotient right over here, or I could say the quotient times x minus one. So it's going to be equal to this business. It's going to be equal to three x minus one times the divisor, times x minus one. When you multiply these two things, you're not going to get exactly this. You still have to add the remainder. So plus the remainder. Actually, let me write the actual remainder down. So plus six. The analogy here is exactly the analogy to when you did traditional division. If I were to say, actually, let me just show you the analogy. If I were to say 25 divided by four, you would say, okay, well four goes into 25 six times, six times four is 24. You would subtract, and then you would get a remainder, one. Or another way of saying this is you could say that 25 is equal to six times four plus one. So we just did the exact same thing here, but we just did it with expressions. So once again, I haven't started the proof yet, I just wanted to make you feel comfortable with what I just wrote right over here. If I divided this expression into this polynomial, and I were to get this quotient, that's the same thing as saying this polynomial could be equal to three x minus one times x minus one plus six. Now this is true in general. Let's abstract a little bit. This is our f of x. So that is f of x. So f of x is going to be equal to whatever the quotient is. Let me call that q of x. So do this in a different color. So I'm going to call that q of x. This right over here is q of x. So f of x is going to be equal to the quotient, q of x, times, this is our x minus a, in this case a is one, but I'm just trying to generalize it a little bit. So x minus a, and then plus the remainder. We know that the remainder is going to be a constant because the remainder is going to have a lower degree then x minus a. X minus a is a first degree. So in order to have a lower degree, this has to be zeroth degree. This has to be a constant. So this is true in general. This is true for any polynomial f of x divided by any x minus a. So this is just true. So this is true for any f of x and x minus a. Now what is going to happen if we evaluate f of a? Well if f of x can be written like this, well we could write f of, let me do a in a new color so it sticks out. We could write f of a would be equal to q of a times, I think you might see where this is going, times a minus a plus r. Well what's that going to be equal to? What's all this business going to be equal to? Well a minus a is zero, and q of a, I don't care what q of a is, if you're going to multiply it by zero all of this is going to be zero. So f of a is going to be equal to r. And so you're done. This is the proof of the polynomial remainder theorem. Any function, if when you divide it by x minus a you get the quotient q of x and the remainder r, it can then be written in this way. If it's written in this way and you evaluated at f of a and you put the a over here, you're going to see that f of a is going to be whatever that remainder was. That is the polynomial remainder theorem. And we're done. One of the simpler proofs that exists for something that at first seems somewhat magical.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-1
" What we're going to do in this video is review the product rule that you probably learned a while ago. And from that, we're going to derive the formula for integration by parts, which could really be viewed as the inverse product rule, integration by parts. So let's say that I start with some function that can be expressed as the product f of x, can be expressed as a product of two other functions, f of x times g of x. Now let's take the derivative of this function, let's apply the derivative operator right over here. And this, once again, just a review of the product rule. It's going to be the derivative of the first function times the second function. So it's going to be f-- no, I'm going to do that blue color-- it's going to be f-- that's not blue-- it's going to be f prime of x times g of x times-- that's not the same color-- times g of x plus the first function times the derivative of the second, plus the first function, f of x, times the derivative of the second. This is all a review right over here. The derivative of the first times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. Now, let's take the antiderivative of both sides of this equation. Well if I take the antiderivative of what I have here on the left, I get f of x times g of x. We won't think about the constant for now. We can ignore that for now. And that's going to be equal to-- well what's the antiderivative of this? This is going to be the antiderivative of f prime of x times g of x dx plus the antiderivative of f of x g prime of x dx. Now, what I want to do is I'm going to solve for this part right over here. And to solve for that, I just have to subtract this business. I just have to subtract this business from both sides. And then if I subtract that from both sides, I'm left with f of x times g of x minus this, minus the antiderivative of f prime of x g of x-- let me do that in a pink color-- g of x dx is equal to what I wanted to solve for, is equal to the antiderivative of f of x g prime of x dx. And to make it a little bit clearer, let me swap sides here. So let me copy and paste this. So let me copy and then paste it. There you go. And then let me copy and paste the other side. So let me copy and paste it. So I'm just switching the sides, just to give it in a form that you might be more used to seeing in a calculus book. So this is essentially the formula for integration by parts. I will square it off. You'll often see it squared off in a traditional textbook. So I will do the same. So this right over here tells us that if we have an integral or an antiderivative of the form f of x times the derivative of some other function, we can apply this right over here. And you might say, well this doesn't seem that useful. First I have to identify a function that's like this. And then still I have an integral in it. But what we'll see in the next video is that this can actually simplify a whole bunch of things that you're trying to take the antiderivative of.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-integration-new
" -  So, let's draw a blood vessel. Here is a blood vessel. In any human, you or me, there's lots of different blood cells travelling around in all the blood vessels of the body. So, you've got your red blood cells, that I'm drawing here. But you've also got your T cells, which are immune cells. You've also got B cells. You've also got something called a macrophage. You've got neutrophils. You've got little platelets, which are actually fragments of cells, they don't have their own nucleoid. And, all in all, you actually have about 10 different kinds of blood cells. And a question you can ask, which is what we're gonna address in this video, is where do all these blood cells come from? Do you know? I'm gonna draw the answer right now and see if you can figure out what exactly I'm drawing. So, this is a bone. Because all these blood cells in the body come from the bone marrow. And here's the bone marrow that I'm drawing here. Now, actually it turns out that they don't come from all the bone marrow of the body. They come from certain places. Some of those places are the head of, for example, the femur, which is the long bone in your thigh. The head of the humerus, which is the long bone in your arm. Those are all long bones. And they also come from something called flat bones. These are very simple names, which I think is always good for us when we're learning a field. Flat bones, such as the one I'm drawing here, which is the sternum. The sternum is the flat bone in your body that connects to all the ribs. Here are some ribs. Of course, it has ribs on both sides. So, the blood cells come from these parts of the long bones and the flat bones of the body. And it turns out, which is interesting and which was not always known, it turns out that all these blood cells in your body have one common precursor, one grandfather, if you will. So, there's one grandfather cell that gives rise to all of these guys. And I'll draw him here. So, here he is. He's purple. His name is complicated. He's called a pluripotent. Pluripotent. If you ever took Latin, you might know that that means sort of able to do anything. Pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell. And the reason that he's called pluripotent is that he is able to give rise to any of the ten blood cells. So, hematopoietic stem cell. You might recall that stem cells are sort of undifferentiated cells that can give rise to many different kinds of cells. So, this grandfather cell gives rise to two different lineages. And those two lineages are the myeloid lineage and the lymphoid lineage. And each of these lineages gives rise to many different cells. The myeloid lineage gives rise to red blood cells, which are biconcave in shape. They are the most common of all blood cells. Now, the myeloid lineage also gives rise to a big cell called a megakaryocyte. Now, you might have never heard of this before, but the megakaryocytes themselves produce platelets, which I think that you've probably have heard of. So, here are platelets. They're little fragments of cells, which actually bud off of the megakaryocytes like this. They kind of squeeze out little pieces of cytoplasm that become platelets. And now I have a challenge for you. Do you think that a macrophage, which is an immune cell that likes to eat up invaders like bacteria, do you think that macrophages come from the myeloid lineage or the lymphoid lineage? So, I was surprised to find out that they actually come from the myeloid lineage. I was surprised because macrophages are immune cells, but they actually come from the same lineage as red blood cells and platelets. So here is a... This is actually not yet a macrophage, this is a monocyte. A lot of crazy words here, but this is a monocyte. Monocytes actually become macrophages once they settle down in the tissues. But, before that, while they're still circulating, they are monocytes. And, in addition to the monocyte, the myeloid lineage gives rise to three guys, one of whom you have heard of probably, two of whom you may not have heard of. I'll just draw them here. So, the one you might have heard of is the, I'm running out of space here, but it's the neutrophil. Neutrophils are the most common immune cell in the blood. The other two are called eosinophils, which are significantly more rare than neutrophils. And, even more rare than eosinophils, are something called the basophils. So, it's the three phils. So, now let's go over to the lymphoid lineage. There's three important cells that come from this one. Two of them you've probably heard of. I'll draw them first. They're both lymphocytes, so it makes sense that they come from the lymphoid lineage. And those are B cells and T cells. And if you recall, B cells are the guys that are going to put out this molecule. Do you know what that is? That's an antibody. B cells make antibodies. And T cells have their own functions that you can learn about in the immune system videos. Now, the lymphoid lineage also gives rise to something called, it actually has a very sort of die morbid name. It's called a natural killer cell. Sometimes, we say NK. Natural killer. So, this is pretty much it. Here we've got our grandfather cell, who gives rise to two lines. You could call these, maybe, the father cells, if you want. And these give rise to our whole array of blood cells. Some of them you've heard of, some of them you haven't. You'll hear more about the ones you haven't heard of in the future. There's one or two more I wanna mention now that are maybe a little more complicated. We have something called a dendritic cell. And the reason I didn't mention it before is because the dendritic cells actually come from both sides, both lineages, which is confusing. They can come from the lymphoid and they can come from the myeloid by way of monocytes. So, monocytes can become dendritic cells. And then we also have another one coming from the myeloid lineage, which is actually fairly important. I could have mentioned it earlier. It's called a mast cell. And mast cells are most notable for causing allergic reactions. They release histamine. You know when you have an allergic reaction you might take an anti-histamine and you do that so that these mast cells can't make you feel crummy.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" Let's continue with our orange juice producing example In this situation I want to think about what a rational quantity of orange juice might be what would be a rational quantity of orange juice to produce given a market price So let's say that the market price right now is 50 cents a gallon and I'm going to assume that there are many producers here so we're going to have to be price takers and obviously we want to charge as much as we can per gallon but if we charge even a penny over 50 cents a gallon then people are going to buy all of their orange juice from other people so this is the price that we can charge 50 cents per gallon So, if we think about it in terms of marginal revenue per incremental gallon well that first incremental gallon we're going to get 50 cents the next incremental gallon we're going to get 50 cents for that one and the next one we're going to get 50 cents as well. for the first thousand gallons we're going to get 50 cents for each of those gallons for the first 10 thousand gallons we'll get 50 cents per gallon So, our marginal revenue curve will look something like this Our marginal revenue is a flat curve right at 50 cents a gallon so that is our marginal revenue at 50 cents at a market price of 50 cents per gallon now in this situation what's a reasonable quantity that we would want to produce? Now there's two dynamics here we want to produce as much as possible so that we can spread our fixed cost over those gallons that's one way of thinking about it or, another way of thinking about it is we have a certain amount of fixed cost we are spending $1000 no matter what so why don't we try to get as much revenue as possible to try to make up for those fixed costs or if we think about it in terms of average fixed cost the more quantity that we produce the component of the cost for that from the fixed cost goes down and down and down so we want to have as much as possible to spread our fixed costs now the one thing that we do need to think about is especially once we kind of get beyond the little dip in the marginal cost curve and as we produce more and more units the marginal cost is going up higher and higher and higher we don't want to produce so much that the cost of producing that incremental unit the marginal cost of that incremental unit is more than the marginal cost of that actual or the marginal cost of that incremental unit is not higher than the marginal revenue that we're getting on that incremental unit so, until marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost or another way to think about it you don't want marginal cost and this is after we go to this little dip here we're trying to do as much as possible marginal cost is going higher and higher and higher we don't want to produce this much right over here because here the cost for that extra gallon is higher than what we're going to get for that extra gallon looks like that cost for that extra gallon might be 53 cents while we're only gonna get 50 cents for that extra gallon so every extra gallon we produce over here we're going to be losing money so you don't want marginal cost to be greater than marginal revenue so when you look at the curves like this and make sense to just say when does marginal revenue equal marginal cost? and that's this point right over here and that is the rational amount to produce so that is 9000 units so we're going to be at this line over here we're gonna produce 9000 gallons of juice our revenue that we're going to get is going to be the rectangle of the area that is high as the price we're getting per unit times the number of units so this is gonna be the total revenue we get if we were to shade this in I'm not gonna shade this in because it's going to make my whole diagram messy and what's our total cost? well, we have our average total cost right here this is our average total cost at 48 cents that's the little green triangle here so it's 48 cents per unit times the total number of units our cost, the area in this rectangle so if I were to shade this in this little slightly smaller rectangle and so our profits are the difference between the two our total revenue is the area under the rectangle that has this marginal revenue line as its upper bound and our cost is the rectangle that has our average total cost this line right over here as its upper bound so our profits in this circumstance are going to be the area right over here the height is the difference between our marginal cost which is the same as our marginal revenue and our total cost so the heigh is going to be this two cents right over here we're taking the difference of 50 and 48 so it's gonna be 2 cents and then, the quantity produced is going to be 9000 units so 9000 we're making 2 cents per unit remember, our average cost our average total cost is 48 cents per unit we're selling that 50 cents per unit so we're making 2 cents per unit that's not 20 we're making 2 cents per unit 2 cents times 9000 units gives us that's 18000 cents, or 180 dollars of profit now what I want you to think about and we'll answer this in the next video is does it make sense to sell units at all and if so, how many units should we sell if, and here is the question if the market price is lower than your average total cost so does it make sense and how many units does it make sense to produce let's say if the market price were 45 cents per unit does it make sense for us to produce",economics-finance-domain_microeconomics_firm-economic-profit
" - Line segments IN, this is segment IN over here, and TO, this is TO here, are reflected over the line Y is equal to negative X minus two. So this is the line that they're reflected about this dashed, purple line. And it is indeed Y equals negative X minus two. This right over here is in slope intercept form. The slope should be negative one, and we see that the slope of this purple line is indeed negative one. If X changes by a certain amount, Y changes by the negative of that. If X changes by one, Y changes by negative one to get back to that line. If X changes by positive two, Y changes by negative two to get back to another point on that line. And the Y intercept? We see when X is equal to zero, Y should be negative two. When X is equal to zero, Y is indeed negative two. So we've validated that. Then they say, ""Draw the image of this reflection, using the interactive graph."" Alright, so we can move these lines around, and we want to reflect these. And I could try to eyeball it, you know, maybe it's something like this. I don't know, it doesn't exactly right. That looks close to the reflection of IN, and for TO I'd want to move this down here. TO looks like it would be, I don't know, I'm eyeballing it. This is close, but it can't be close. I want to get exact. So let's, I've copied and pasted the original problem on my scratch pad so we can find the exact points and so I don't just have to estimate this. So let's go to the scratch pad. So exactly what we just saw. And the main realization is, is that if we want to reflect a given point, if we want to reflect a given point, say point I right over here, what we want to do is we want to drop a perpendicular. We want to find a line that's perpendicular, or a line that has the point I on it, and it's perpendicular to this line right over here. Remember this is the line, let me do this is that purple color. This is the line, Y is equal to negative X minus two. Its slope is equal to negative one. So I want a line that goes through I, point I, that is perpendicular to this line, and I want to drop it, I want to drop it to, I want to drop it to the line that I'm going to reflect on, and then I'm going to go the same distance onto the other side to find to find the corresponding point in the image. So how do I do that? Well if this line, if this purple line has a slope of negative one, a line that is perpendicular to it a line that is perpendicular to it so this thing that I'm drawing in purple right over here, its slope is going to be the negative reciprocal of this. So the reciprocal of negative one is still just negative one. One over negative one is still negative one. But we want the negative of that. So the slope here needs to be one. And luckily, that's how I drew it. The slope here needs to be equal to one which is however much I change in the X direction I change in the Y direction. We see that. To go from this point to this point right over here, we decrease Y by four and we decrease X by four. Now, if we want to stay on this line to find the reflection, we just do the same thing. We could decrease X by four, so we'll go from negative two to negative six, and decrease Y by four, and we end up at this point right over here. So we end up at the point, this is X equals negative six, Y is equal to negative four. So this is, this point corresponds to this point right over there. Now, let's do the same thing. Let's do the same thing for point N. For point N, we already know, if we drop a perpendicular, and this is perpendicular, it's going to have a slope of one because this purple line has a slope of negative one. The negative reciprocal of negative one is positive one. And let's see, to go from this point to this point of intersection, we have to go down one and a half. We're going down one and a half, and we're going to the left one and a half. So we want to do that on the other side. We want to stay on this perpendicular line. So we want to go left one and a half, and down one and a half. And we get to this point right over here, which is the point X equals three, Y is equal to negative eight. So we are now equidistant. We're on this perpendicular line, still, but we're equidistant on the other side. So the image of IN is going to go through negative six, negative four, and three, negative eight. So let me draw that. Let me see if I can remember, negative six, negative four, and three, negative eight. So I have a bad memory. So negative six, negative four, and three, negative eight. And I was close when I estimated, but I wasn't exactly right. So that's looking pretty good. And actually, we can do the exact same thing with points T and point O. Let me do that. So point T, to point T, To get from point T to the line in the shortest distance, once again, we drop a perpendicular. This line is going to have a slope of one, because it's perpendicular to the line that has a slope of negative one. And so to get there, we have to decrease our X by we have to decrease our X. We're going from X equals five to X equals, it looks like, half. So X went down by four and a half in the X direction and Y also needs to go down by four and a half. So if we want to stay on that line, let's decrease our X by four and a half. So that's half, one, two, three, four. And Y needs to go down by four and a half. So that's half, one, two, three, four, and we get to this point right over here, which is the point X equals negative four, Y is equal to negative seven. And it's negative four, negative seven. Let me, so this should be at, X equals negative four, Y equals negative seven. And there's a couple of things you could do here. You could just say, hey, this is two long, or two units long, not like, too long in length, somehow. This is two units long, so maybe this is two units long. So this is feeling pretty good. But let's just go through the exercise for point O as well. So point O, once again, this is going to have, if we drop a perpendicular, it's going to have a slope of one. So whatever our change in X between this point and this point, we're going to have the same change in Y. And our change in X, to go from seven to... Seven to one and a half, our change in X is five and a half. So then we do it this way. So the change in X here, so the change in X is equal to negative five and a half, five point five. If you subtract five point five from seven, you get to one point five. And our change in Y. Our change in Y is also negative five point five. Change is Y is negative, you're not going to see that so I'm going to do it differently, negative five point five. And so we need to stay on this line. So we need to change by those same amounts onto the other side of that line. So if we decrease our X by five and a half. So half, one, two, three, four, five, we get there, and Y by five and a half, half, one, two, three, four, five. We get to the point, X equals negative four, Y is equal to negative nine. So we get to the point X equals negative four, Y is equal to negative nine, and we're done! We have figured out the reflection of these two segments.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-symmetry-icse
" -  So, let's shift over to pericarditis now, and let's start with infectious causes there. It used to be that the Coxsackie virus also was the most common cause of pericarditis, but recent studies have suggested that the number one cause of pericarditis, and this is again for the first world, so in developed countries, first world, may be from viruses, so I'll write viruses. So, viruses such as what's called cytomegalovirus. There's also herpes simplex virus, which is the herpes virus you hear about a lot, and there's also the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, which you may have heard of as well. In the third world, however, we make a distinction for pericarditis. There's a different most common cause out there, in the third world countries, so the third world. Pericarditis, especially if it's advanced, is from a type of bacterium that you may have heard of before. It's called mycobacterium tuberculae or TB. TB is the most common cause of pericarditis in the third world, and I'll write down here as a side note, this is especially true, so especially true for constrictive, constrictive pericarditis. And we'll talk more about what constrictive pericarditis means, but I think I've already touched on it. It's so much inflammation of the pericardium that the heart isn't able to fill with an adequate amount of blood to pump to the rest of your body. So, TB is especially the cause of constrictive pericarditis. So, let's skip on down here, and let's talk about some non-infectious causes of inflammation of the pericardium, and I think one of the most interesting ones is what's referred to as a post-myocardial, post-myocardial infarction pericarditis, post-myocardial infarction pericarditis. And maybe I'm throwing a lot at you by saying that here, but just suffice it to say a myocardial infarction is the exact same thing as a heart attack, heart attack. Myocardial you might recognize as myocardium, and infarction means a loss of blood flow leading to tissue death. So, a myocardial infarction, or it might be called an MI, you may have heard that term, but this is also referred to as Dressler's syndrome, Dressler's syndrome, and Dressler's syndrome happens between something like two to three weeks. So, I'll write two to three weeks to one month. I'll use or take advantage of the terminology we just introduced earlier, one month post-MI, or after a heart attack, where you have markers in the myocardium that are altered because of the ischemia or the loss of blood flow released into the blood stream that causes the immune system to create antibodies to it. And these antibodies, for some reason, will also attack the pericardium as well, resulting in post-myocardial infarction pericarditis. All right, let's move on. Another important cause of pericarditis could be radiation exposure, and this isn't just one chest x-ray. This is having multiple CAT scans of your chest over and over again over decades could cause radiation-induced pericarditis, and the mechanism for this is what's called reactive fibrosis. Reactive fibrosis is what results in pericarditis here. Another important cause is cancer. Not cancer of the pericardium, but cancer elsewhere. Maybe you've got lung cancer, or you've got breast cancer, and what happens is these cancers that are occurring elsewhere, they spread to seed. So, seeding meaning they start invading or populating. So, they seed the pericardial space. They seed the pericardial space, and they cause reactive inflammatory changes because they are present there. Another important cause of pericarditis is just plain old trauma. Maybe you're in a motor vehicle collision, and it's a deceleration collision, where your car is stopped really abruptly because you've run into a wall, and then you fly forward, and your chest hits the steering wheel so hard that the steering wheel is deformed. So, what that does then is, you end up getting what's called a contusion. Contusion, which is just a fancy word for a bruise. So, a contusion from compression of the sternum. So, compression of the sternum, which is a bone in your chest, and I'll show you a picture of it in a second. So, the sternum, which is also known as your breastbone, on the pericardium. So, it's the sternum on the pericardium, and it compresses it and causes damage to the pericardium, and when the immune system tries to heal the pericardium, it ends up becoming inflamed temporarily, which causes pericarditis. So, I've got this nice animation here, and oh, this is so cool. This is an animated sagittal cardiac MRI. So, MRI meaning this is a magnetic resoce image, and this is just a special way of taking a look at what's happening in the chest. Sagittal meaning we've cut this person in half, like if you karate chopped them right through the head and down through the legs. What we're seeing here is the right side of the heart, and this is the right ventricle pumping blood through the pulmonary artery and out towards the lungs, and this part that ends abruptly, this is the aorta. This is the arch of the aorta that goes into the thoracic aorta, if you know those points of anatomy. If you don't, that's okay. But the aorta here is supposed to connect to the left ventricle, but we don't really see how it connects. It ends abruptly up here, because we've karate chopped between the right and the left ventricle. And so, that's why we're only seeing this here. And the heart, of course, is just beating away blood into the aorta very beautifully. The point of this image I want to show you here is this bone that sits here. This is the sternum. This is the sternum that's right here, and this is the top part. You have the sternal notch that's around here, and when you have a car accident, and the steering wheel compresses against the sternum here, this will then be shifted backwards, and it'll hit against the pericardium. It'll hit against the pericardium and then compress the heart. And, in fact, in CPR or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, when you compress on the chest, you do chest compressions to artificially pump blood out of the heart, into the aorta, and up into your brain to oxygenate tissue while a person is not beating their own heart, you also do the same thing, where you have the sternum press up against the pericardium. That's another cause, potentially, of pericarditis as well. So, this is a great image that we can see all of this happening here, as normally it should with the heart pumping, but realize the sternum sits right here and could compress against the heart in a traumatic way in an accident. So, let's be gone with this image. Go away. And let's keep talking right here. So, the last sort of subgroup of causes I want to talk about that are non-infectious are metabolic causes of pericarditis, metabolic causes, and there are two main ones I want to talk about here. One is called hypothyroidism. You may have heard about the thyroid. The thyroid is an organ that sits in your neck. Hypothyroidism is when this organ is not releasing much thyroid hormone. And thyroid hormone is responsible for increasing your metabolic rate, increasing blood pressure, and a lot of other things in your body. When you have hypothyroidism, you don't have enough of the thyroid hormone. So, you can get arrhythmias. Your skin can become course, because you have a slow metabolic rate. These people tend to gain weight as well. So, hypothyroidism, for some reason, will also cause pericarditis that is best treated by replacing this missing thyroid hormone. Another important metabolic cause of pericarditis is what's called uremia. Uremia is just the build up, so I'll write in parentheses here build up of nitrogenous waste. I'll just write N for nitrogenous, nitrogenous waste, and it's the same type of waste your kidneys should be getting rid of. It's urea, if you've heard of that type of waste product. It's a nitrogenous waste product, but in folks that are on dialysis with end-stage renal disease or chronic kidney disease, their kidneys don't work. And so, they rely on dialysis to get rid of these waste products. If they skip a dialysis session, then maybe these nitrogenous waste products can build up and irritate the pericardium, leading to what's called a uremic, uremic pericarditis, which is something that's treated with dialysis. You get rid of the nitrogenous waste, you get rid of the uremia, you get rid of the pericarditis. So, in the next couple of videos, we're going to start talking about how we can treat or diagnose myocarditis and pericarditis. For infectious causes, unless it's a viral pericarditis, you'd probably use an antibiotic for a bacterial or a fungal or a protozoan cause of your myocarditis or pericarditis. For a non-infectious cause, you would treat the cause. If it's something that you're missing, like thyroid hormone, you would replace thyroid hormone. 1Some things you can't treat. 1You can't make trauma not happen, 1but it's important to understand 1what the cause of their disease was, 1to help guide the way you would treat it.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system-diseases
" -  We're asked to simplify the expression by removing all factors that are perfect squares from inside the radicals and combining the terms. So, let's see if we can do it and pause the video and give a-go at it before we do it together. Alright, so let's see how we can re-write these radicals. So, four times the square root of 20. Well, thats the same thing as four times the square root of four, times the square root of five, because 20 is the same thing as four times five. And 45, that's the same thing as nine times five. And the reason why I'm thinking about the four and I'm thinking about the nine is because those are perfect squares, so I could write this as, four times the square root of four times the square root of five. And then I could say, this part right over here is minus three, times the square root of nine, times the square root of five. The square root of 45 is the same thing as the square root of nine times five, which is the same thing as square root of nine times the square root of five, and then all of that is going to be over, all of that is over the square root of 35. Now, are there any perfect squares in 35? 35 is seven times five. No, neither of those are perfect squares. So, I could just leave that as square root of 35. And, let's see, the square root of four? Well, thats going to be two. This is the principal root, so we're thinking about the positive square root. The square root of nine is three. And so, this part right over is going to be four times two, times the square root of five, so it's going to be eight square roots of five. And then, this part over here is going to be minus three, times three, times the square root of five. So, minus nine square roots of five. And all of that is going to be over the square root of 35. Square root of 35. And, so let's see, if I have eight of something, and I subtract nine of that something, I'm gonna have negative one of that something. So, I could say negative one times the square root of five, or I could just say negative square root of five. Negative square root of five over the square root of 35. I actually think I could simplify this even more, because this is the same thing. This is equal to the negative of the square root of five over 35. Both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by five. So, we could divide them both by five, and we would get the square root of divide the numerator by five, you get one. Divide the denominator by five, you get seven. So, we can view this as the square root of 1/7th. Square root of 1/7th. And we are all done. Let's do another one of these. These are strangely, strangely fun. And once again, pause it, and see if you can work it out on your own. Perform the indicated operations. Alright, so let's first multiply. So, this essentially is doing the distributive property twice. And, actually let me just do it that way, so let's distribute the square root of five, plus the square root of six. Let's first multiply it times the square root of five. So, the square root of five times the square root of five is going to be five. Square root of five times the square root of six is the square root of 30. So, five plus the square root of 30. And then, when I take this expression, and I multiply it times the second term, times the negative square root of six. Well, negative square root of six times the square root of five is going to be the negative of the square root of 30. And then the negative of the square root of six times the square root of six is going to be, we're gonna subtract six. The square root of six times the square root of six is six, then we have the negative out there. And so, just like that, we are left with, well, let's see. Square root of 30 minus the square root of 30, well those cancel out, thats zero. And we're left with five minus six, which is going to be equal to negative one. And we are, we're, we're all done. Now, another way that you could've viewed this, is you could've seen a pattern here. You could've said, Well, this is the same thing as A plus B, times A minus B, or A is square root of five and B is square root of six, and we know that this will result in the difference of squares. This is will be A squared minus B squared. And, so this for this particular case it would be square root of five squared, minus square root of six squared. Which is of course equal to five minus six, which is equal to negative one. Either way, hopefully you found that vaguely entertaining.",math_algebra-home_alg-exp-and-log
" -  Ali is in charge of the dinner menu for his senior prom, and he wants to use a one-sample Z interval to estimate what proportion of seniors would order a vegetarian option. He randomly selects 30 of the 150 total seniors and finds that seven of those sampled would order the vegetarian option. Which conditions for constructing this confidence interval did Ali's sample meet? So, pause this video, and you can select more than one of these. Alright now, let's work through this together. So one thing that you might be wondering is, well, what is a one-sample Z interval? Well, you could really interpret that as he's gonna take one sample and then construct a confidence interval based on that. The reason why it might be called a Z interval is the whole idea behind a confidence interval is you're going to pick a number of standard deviations above and below the true parameter that you are actually trying to estimate, and then use that to make your inferences. And one way of thinking about the number of standard deviations, people will often call that a Z score, or Z is often used as a variable for the number of standard deviations above or below something. So really, he's just trying to construct a confidence interval, but remember, in order to construct a confidence interval, we have to make some assumptions. He's taking, there's 150 students, right over here. He's finding it impractical to survey all 150 to figure out the true population proportion. So instead, he samples 30 of the seniors. So, N is equal to 30. And from that, he calculates a sample proportion. Looks like seven out of the 30 are, they want the vegetarian option. And he's going to determine some confidence level and then construct a confidence interval. But remember the conditions that we've talked about in the previous videos. The first thing is, we have to be confident that, is this a random sample? So that would be the random condition, and that's what choice A is telling us. The data is a random sample from the population of interest. Do we know that? Well, it tells us in the passage here, he randomly selects 30 of the total seniors. So I guess we'll take their word for it. We don't know his methodology of what he considers random, but we'll take their word for it, that yes, this has been met. The data is a random sample. If it said he sampled the football team, well, that would not have been a random sample. The next condition here looks all mathematical, but this is really the normal condition. And the idea behind the normal condition is that, in order to construct these confidence intervals, we're assuming that the sampling distribution of the sample proportions is roughly normal, and it is not skewed to the right or skewed to the left like this. And so, right here it says, look, the sample size times our sample proportion has to be greater than/equal to 10. Or our sample size times one minus our sample proportion has to be greater than/equal to 10. Well, another way to think about this is, our successes in our sample need to be greater than/equal to 10, and our failures need to be greater than/equal to 10. Well, how many successes were there? There were seven. And you could even say, look, our N is 30 times our sample proportion is seven over 30, which is going to be seven. So our successes is less than 10, so actually, we violate the normal condition. Once again, this is a rule of thumb, but this is telling us that our actual sampling distribution might be skewed. Remember, this is just based on one sample, what we're able to figure out. This is one sample Z interval. We might be wrong, but we wouldn't feel good that we're meeting the normal condition here, so I would rule this one out. Individual observations can be considered independent. Well, if he randomly selected people with replacement, then they could be independent. Or, if the people he is selecting, if his sample size is less than 10% of the total population, then it could be considered independent, even though it wouldn't be perfectly independent. But we see here that he sampled 30 people out of 150. So his sample size was 30 out of 150, which is the same thing as one fifth of the population, which is the same thing as 20%. And since this is greater than 10%, we are violating the independence condition. We could have met the independence condition if he was sampling with replacement, which it doesn't seem like he is, or if this thing right over here was less than 10%. But we're not meeting that, so we cannot feel good about that constraint. And so, since we're not meeting two of the three constraints for, I would say, valid confidence intervals, or confidence intervals we would feel confident in, this is not so good of an analysis on Ali's part.",math_statistics-probability_confidence-intervals-one-sample
" -  Part B, using correct units, explain the meaning of the definite integral, so it's definite integral from zero from T equals zero to T equals 40 of the absolute value of V of T DT in the context of the problem. Approximate the value of that integral using a right Riemann sum with the four subintervals indicated in the table. All right so let's first tackle the first part. So what's the meaning of this definite integral? So the velocity, velocity is a vector, it has direction, and you can see when you look up here that sometimes the velocity is positive and sometimes it is negative, and a reasonable interpretation of that is well this is when she's walking in one direction and then that's where whatever direction we assume is the positive direction and this is when she's walking the other way, and so she has a positive velocity here and then she has a negative velocity. She has some speed in the other direction and then she has a positive velocity again. So if you were to take the absolute value of this, if you just cared about the magnitude of the velocity, well we're talking about, we're talking about speed, but we're not just talking about the absolute value of velocity, we're integrating the absolute value of velocity over time from time equals zero to time equals 40. So if you integrate speed, if you're saying okay for every for every little amount of time DT she has some speed, well that's going to give you the distance that she travels. So the distance remember, is the difference between distance and displacement is displacement you can think of as the net distance it takes if you go back and forth a bunch of times it's going to add up to the distance, but they're going to net out with respect to each other in displacement. So this right over is going to give us the total distance, not displacement, that she travels over those 40 minutes. If there was no absolute value sign here then we'd be talking about the displacement and so let me write that. So this integral from zero to 40 absolute value V of T DT is the total distance distance she travels she travels over the 40 minutes over the 40, over the 40 minutes, remember our unit of time here is in minutes. All right. So using correct units and so this is and so the units, let me write it this way. Is a total distance she travels over the 40 minutes. The units are meters. The units are meters, are meters. All right, now this says approximate the value of that integral using a right Riemann sum with the four subintervals indicated in the table. So what do they mean by a right Riemann sum? Well actually, let me just, let me just draw, let me draw the absolute value of the V of T and I already took the trouble of the last part of drawing the axis and you wouldn't actually have to do this on the test, but I'm doing this to just help you understand what we're actually going to do when we talk about a right Riemann sum. So if we, so in orange I have V of T, but if I want to do the absolute value of V of T, I'll do that in magenta, so the absolute value of that is that, absolute value of that is that, absolute value of that is that, absolute value of negative 220 is going to be positive 220. So we saw here when time, when T is equal to 24 V of T is negative 220, she's running in the opposite direction or jogging on the other direction, but we're going to take the absolute value of that. So when T is equal to 24, her speed, we could say, is going to be 220, we're going to take the absolute value of it. So it's going to be right around, right around there and then the absolute value of this is going to be that point again and so we don't know the actual velocity function. The actual velocity function, I don't know, it might look something like, it might look something like, like this. It goes like that, maybe it dips down. I should say the speed function. We don't know the actual speed function. So this is the absolute value of V of T, which is the speed function you could say. Speed, speed function, and so if we wanted to actually integrate it, so if we wanted to integrate it, well we don't know how to do it if we don't know, we don't know how to do it exactly without knowing the exact function, but we can approximate what the integral is going to be with a right Riemann sum and a Riemann sum is just breaking up this area into rectangles and then finding the total area of those rectangles. And then there's a couple of ways you could do it, you could use, you could use for each rectangle you could use the left boundary as the height or you could use the right boundary as the height and so they tell us to use a right Riemann sum. A right Riemann sum, so for each of the rectangles, for each of the intervals we're going to use the value of our function on the right side to approximate the area. So let's do that. So let me divide this into four rectangles and they give us the four intervals. So one interval goes from zero to T equals 12, we see that there. The other integral goes from 12 to 20, the next integral goes from 20 to 24, the next integral goes from 24 to 40, and if the whole notation of a Riemann sum is completely foreign to you, I encourage you to watch the videos on Khan Academy on Riemann sums. And so here we are. So the first interval's from zero to 12 and so we want to use the value of our function on the right side to define the height of the rectangle. So let me define. So that rectangle is going to look, is going to look like this, so that's a rectangle right over there. Then the next interval goes from 12 to 20. The next rectangle goes from 12 to 20, we see that there. From 12 to 20. So let's use a value of our function at 20 to define the height of this rectangle. So just like that. Look like, let me do it, I'll just hand draw that. It would look like that and then the next rectangle goes from T equals 20 to T equals 24 and we want to use the right hand side to define the height of that rectangle. You can see it's a little irregular and that's okay, they all don't have to have the same width. So the height is something like this, and then the last interval is T equals 24 to T equals 40 and so we use the right side as the height. So the interval, so this was the last interval we did, the next interval is going to be that and then the height we use the right hand side to define the height that's why it's a right Riemann sum and so our approximation of the integral of the absolute value of V of T is going to be the area of these rectangles over here, and so we could write, we could write the integral from zero to 40 of the absolute value of V of T DT is approximately, well it's going to be this first change in time times this height, so this first change in time this is a change in time of 12 times, so it's going to be 12 times, what's the height? Well V of 12 we knew was 200, V of 12 is 200. So it's going to be 12 times, 12 times 200 plus, okay the height here or the next interval goes from 12 to 20, so it's going to be eight times and then the height here is going to be what is V of 20, I think that was V of 20 was 240. V of 20 was 240, and then the next interval goes from 20 to 24 so that only has a change in time of four and then what is the height at 24? The height at 24, and remember we took the absolute value of V of T so it's 220. So four times 220 and then our last rectangle, our change in time we go from 24 to 40, so our change in time is 16 times the height at 40. What was that? That was 150 I think. Yup, that was a 150. So times 150. 150, and so, just to make clear what I just did, I'm just adding up the sums of the areas of these rectangles. The area of this rectangle is 12 times 200, area of this rectangle's eight times 240, the area of this rectangle's four times 220, area of this rectangle's 16 times 150, and then let's see if we could calculate that, we're not allowed to use our calculator for this part so we're going to do it by hand. 12 times 200 is going to be 2400, plus eight times 240, that's going to be 1600, 1600 plus 3200 that is 1920. Did I do that right? Eight times 40 is 3200, or sorry eight times 40 is 320 plus 1600, yup that's right. Plus, this is going to be 880 plus, let's see 15 times 15 is going to be, would be 2250 that would be 15 times 150, and so we're going to have another 150 and so this is going to be 2400. 2400, whoops, it's 2400. 1Then we want to add all these together, 1let me just do it the way that, 1the easiest way. 12400, plus 1920, plus 880, plus, 1plus 2400 again, 1plus 2400 again will give us, 1will give us, we get a zero, we get a 10, 1so let's see we have nine plus nine 1is 18, plus eight is 26 and then we have seven. 1So we get 7,600, 1so is equal to 7,600 1and just to be clear, this would be in meters. 1In, in meters. 1In meters. 1Now you might be saying wait, wait, wait 1didn't we just find an area, 1wouldn't areas be in meters squared? 1But remember, we're finding the area under the velocity, 1under the velocity graph, 1and so if you look at our units, 1say for this rectangle right here 1you're multiplying 12 minutes, 1you're multiplying 12 minutes times 200, 1times 200 meters per minute, 1times 200 meters per minute. 1So when you multiply them out, 1the minutes the cancel with the minutes 1and you're left with 2400 meters. 1So even though it's area, 1if you look at the units, 1it's going to be in meters not meters squared.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-solved-exams
" -  A secant line intersects the curve y = 2x squared + 1 at two points with x-coordinates 4 and 4 + h, where h does not equal 0. What is the slope of the secant line in terms of h? Your answer must be fully expanded and simplified. We know the two points that are on the secant line. It might not be obvious from how they wrote it but let's make a little table here to make that a little bit clearer. We have x and then we have y = 2x squared + 1. So we know that when x = 4, what is y going to be equal to? It's gonna be 2(4 squared) + 1 which is the same thing as 2(16) +1 which is the same thing as 32 + 1 so it is going to be 33. What about when x = 4 + h? Well it's going to be 2(4 +h)squared + 1. That's going to be 2 times, let's see, (4 + h)squared is going to be 16 + 8h + h squared and then we have our + 1 still and if we distribute the 2 that's going to get us to 32 + 16h + 2h squared + 1 and then we add the 32 to the 1 and actually I'm gonna switch the order a little bit so I have the highest degree term first so it's going to be 2h squared + 16h and then + 32 + 1 is 33. We have these two points. We have one point (4, 33) and we have the other point (4+h, 2h squared + 16h + 33) and we just have to find the slope between these two points because the secant line contains both of these points. How do we find the slope of a line? We do change in y / change in x. What's our change in y? If we view this as the end point and this as the starting point, our change in y is going to be this minus that. It's going to be 2h squared + 16h + 33 - 33, those two are going to cancel each other out, and then over, what's our change in x? If we ended at 4 + h but then we started at 4 so it's gonna be 4 + h - 4. These two cancel each with each other and we are left with 2h squared + 16h / h. We can divide everything in the numerator and denominator by h and what are we going to get? This is going to be 1. That's just a 1. This is just an h. We have 2h + 16 / 1. Or just 2h + 16. And we're done. This is the slope of the secant line in terms of h. Once again we just have to think about well the secant line contains the point (4,f(4)) or 2 times 4 squared + 1 right over here and, well I didn't call this f(x) but I think you get the idea, and then when x is 4 + h this is going to be y and we just found the slope between these two points.",math_differential-calculus_dc-diff-intro
" OK. So I took a part two of the exact same camera. And I did it, to be honest, because I took the first one apart to identify the parts inside of it and had some issues getting it back together because some of the screws just were stripped, and it did not want to go back together. And so I bought another one and found out something kind of interesting. So this camera, a lot of products go through different revisions that don't necessarily show up in model numbers. So that means that the manufacturer may have found a better way or a less expensive way to produce something. Or it could be that they just found a cheaper way to produce something and were able to improve their margins. And so with this camera being so low cost, I'm sure the margins are of a great deal of interest to the manufacturer. If you look, this one says version 3.8 and this one says version 3.3. So this is an older version. This version has an epoxy potted central processing unit or CPU. And this one has just a plastic cover over it. So the plastic cover may not be as robust as the epoxy potting. I'm not sure, but it doesn't look quite as stable. It would be harder to mess up those wires. And when I pop this off, the wires are clearly messed up to the CPU there. And obviously, the boards are totally different colors. I guess that lets the manufacturer know that they are different revisions. If you the flip the boards over, you can take a look at the-- let me zoom in just a little bit on this. You can see the charge couple device or the light capturing device is very different. So this one looks larger, more robust. This one looks a lot smaller. So it appears that what they've done this is a cost reduction, probably a reason to change. Also, the onboard memory is a different manufacturer. So it may be that this memory is less expensive, the new memory. This board doesn't need this capacitor. And so perhaps this electrolytic capacitor was a cheaper way of storing a charge during the photo process. And if you look at the lenses here, this one's got a big lens cover over it. And this one has no lens cover over it. So that probably added cost. I don't believe that's actually the lens. I think it's still that tiny little thing that you see inside this one here. But it looks bigger with that. And they probably just got rid of it to reduce cost. So anyway, that's the difference between one of the earlier iterations and one of the later iterations. But as far as consumers go, you wouldn't know any difference at all when you bought the two cameras because they're virtually identical on the outside.",science_electrical-engineering_reverse-engin
" In this video, I want to talk about what is easily one of the most fundamental and profound concepts in statistics and maybe in all of mathematics. And that's the central limit theorem. And what it tells us is we can start off with any distribution that has a well-defined mean and variance-- and if it has a well-defined variance, it has a well-defined standard deviation. And it could be a continuous distribution or a discrete one. I'll draw a discrete one, just because it's easier to imagine, at least for the purposes of this video. So let's say I have a discrete probability distribution function. And I want to be very careful not to make it look anything close to a normal distribution. Because I want to show you the power of the central limit theorem. So let's say I have a distribution. Let's say it could take on values 1 through 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. It's some kind of crazy dice. It's very likely to get a one. Let's say it's impossible-- well, let me make that a straight line. You have a very high likelihood of getting a 1. Let's say it's impossible to get a 2. Let's say it's an OK likelihood of getting a 3 or a 4. Let's say it's impossible to get a 5. And let's say it's very likely to get a 6 like that. So that's my probability distribution function. If I were to draw a mean-- this the symmetric, so maybe the mean would be something like that. The mean would be halfway. So that would be my mean right there. The standard deviation maybe would look-- it would be that far and that far above and below the mean. But that's my discrete probability distribution function. Now what I'm going to do here, instead of just taking samples of this random variable that's described by this probability distribution function, I'm going to take samples of it. But I'm going to average the samples and then look at those samples and see the frequency of the averages that I get. And when I say average, I mean the mean. Let me define something. Let's say my sample size-- and I could put any number here. But let's say first off we try a sample size of n is equal to 4. And what that means is I'm going to take four samples from this. So let's say the first time I take four samples-- so my sample sizes is four-- let's say I get a 1. Let's say I get another 1. And let's say I get a 3. And I get a 6. So that right there is my first sample of sample size 4. I know the terminology can get confusing. Because this is the sample that's made up of four samples. But then when we talk about the sample mean and the sampling distribution of the sample mean, which we're going to talk more and more about over the next few videos, normally the sample refers to the set of samples from your distribution. And the sample size tells you how many you actually took from your distribution. But the terminology can be very confusing, because you could easily view one of these as a sample. But we're taking four samples from here. We have a sample size of four. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to average them. So let's say the mean-- I want to be very careful when I say average. The mean of this first sample of size 4 is what? 1 plus 1 is 2. 2 plus 3 is 5. 5 plus 6 is 11. 11 divided by 4 is 2.75. That is my first sample mean for my first sample of size 4. Let me do another one. My second sample of size 4, let's say that I get a 3, a 4. Let's say I get another 3. And let's say I get a 1. I just didn't happen to get a 6 that time. And notice I can't get a 2 or a 5. It's impossible for this distribution. The chance of getting a 2 or 5 is 0. So I can't have any 2s or 5s over here. So for the second sample of sample size 4, my second sample mean is going to be 3 plus 4 is 7. 7 plus 3 is 10 plus 1 is 11. 11 divided by 4, once again, is 2.75. Let me do one more, because I really want to make it clear what we're doing here. So I do one more. Actually, we're going to do a gazillion more. But let me just do one more in detail. So let's say my third sample of sample size 4-- so I'm going to literally take 4 samples. So my sample is made up of 4 samples from this original crazy distribution. Let's say I get a 1, a 1, and a 6 and a 6. And so my third sample mean is going to be 1 plus 1 is 2. 2 plus 6 is 8. 8 plus 6 is 14. 14 divided by 4 is 3 and 1/2. And as I find each of these sample means-- so for each of my samples of sample size 4, I figure out a mean. And as I do each of them, I'm going to plot it on a frequency distribution. And this is all going to amaze you in a few seconds. So I plot this all on a frequency distribution. So I say, OK, on my first sample, my first sample mean was 2.75. So I'm plotting the actual frequency of the sample means I get for each sample. So 2.75, I got it one time. So I'll put a little plot there. So that's from that one right there. And the next time, I also got a 2.75. That's a 2.75 there. So I got it twice. So I'll plot the frequency right there. Then I got a 3 and 1/2. So all the possible values, I could have a three, I could have a 3.25, I could have a 3 and 1/2. So then I have the 3 and 1/2, so I'll plot it right there. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep taking these samples. Maybe I'll take 10,000 of them. So I'm going to keep taking these samples. So I go all the way to S 10,000. I just do a bunch of these. And what it's going to look like over time is each of these-- I'm going to make it a dot, because I'm going to have to zoom out. So if I look at it like this, over time-- it still has all the values that it might be able to take on, 2.75 might be here. So this first dot is going to be-- this one right here is going to be right there. And that second one is going to be right there. Then that one at 3.5 is going to look right there. But I'm going to do it 10,000 times. Because I'm going to have 10,000 dots. And let's say as I do it, I'm going just keep plotting them. I'm just going to keep plotting the frequencies. I'm just going to keep plotting them over and over and over again. And what you're going to see is, as I take many, many samples of size 4, I'm going to have something that's going to start kind of approximating a normal distribution. So each of these dots represent an incidence of a sample mean. So as I keep adding on this column right here, that means I kept getting the sample mean 2.75. So over time. I'm going to have something that's starting to approximate a normal distribution. And that is a neat thing about the central limit theorem. So an orange, that's the case for n is equal to 4. This was a sample size of 4. Now, if I did the same thing with a sample size of maybe 20-- so in this case, instead of just taking 4 samples from my original crazy distribution, every sample I take 20 instances of my random variable, and I average those 20. And then I plot the sample mean on here. So in that case, I'm going to have a distribution that looks like this. And we'll discuss this in more videos. But it turns out if I were to plot 10,000 of the sample means here, I'm going to have something that, two things-- it's going to even more closely approximate a normal distribution. And we're going to see in future videos, it's actually going to have a smaller-- well, let me be clear. It's going to have the same mean. So that's the mean. This is going to have the same mean. So it's going to have a smaller standard deviation. Well, I should plot these from the bottom because you kind of stack it. One you get one, then another instance and another instance. But this is going to more and more approach a normal distribution. So this is what's super cool about the central limit theorem. As your sample size becomes larger-- or you could even say as it approaches infinity. But you really don't have to get that close to infinity to really get close to a normal distribution. Even if you have a sample size of 10 or 20, you're already getting very close to a normal distribution, in fact about as good an approximation as we see in our everyday life. But what's cool is we can start with some crazy distribution. This has nothing to do with a normal distribution. This was n equals 4, but if we have a sample size of n equals 10 or n equals 100, and we were to take 100 of these, instead of four here, and average them and then plot that average, the frequency of it, then we take 100 again, average them, take the mean, plot that again, and if we do that a bunch of times, in fact, if we were to do that an infinite time, we would find that we, especially if we had an infinite sample size, we would find a perfect normal distribution. That's the crazy thing. And it doesn't apply just to taking the sample mean. Here we took the sample mean every time. But you could have also taken the sample sum. The central limit theorem would have still applied. But that's what's so super useful about it. Because in life, there's all sorts of processes out there, proteins bumping into each other, people doing crazy things, humans interacting in weird ways. And you don't know the probability distribution functions for any of those things. But what the central limit theorem tells us is if we add a bunch of those actions together, assuming that they all have the same distribution, or if we were to take the mean of all of those actions together, and if we were to plot the frequency of those means, we do get a normal distribution. And that's frankly why the normal distribution shows up so much in statistics and why, frankly, it's a very good approximation for the sum or the means of a lot of processes. Normal distribution. What I'm going to show you in the next video is I'm actually going to show you that this is a reality, that as you increase your sample size, as you increase your n, and as you take a lot of sample means, you're going to have a frequency plot that looks very, very close to a normal distribution.",math_ap-statistics_sampling-distribution-ap
" OK. So now what we're going to do is, we're going to modify our arduino o to work with this bot. So the o that we have has these header pins that stick out of the bottom of it, and you can see them here. And the header pins are great for connecting it to a prototyping border or bread board, but they don't provide a lot of ways for us to connect it to our particular bot. So we have these female header pin connectors and they've got a male end and a female end, so we're going to trim off just the right number of those using our nipper pliers. Once we have those trimmed off, we are going to connect the header pins from the arduino to the header pins on our female-male header pin connectors, and that will allow us to plug wires in and take them back out really easily. So it'll make it easier for us to change things out. Otherwise, we would have to solder directly to the arduino, and that could be a problem if, for some reason, we wanted to change something around. So we want to make sure that we count the exact number of pins that is sticking out of the arduino board, and we match the male-female header pin connector to the number of pins that are sticking out there. So we're going to take these pins and we're going to bend them 90 degrees with our pliers. We're going to grab our pliers and we're just going to bend those pins 90 degrees. It's really important that we do we do this carefully and that we bend them completely out 90 degrees, so that they're sticking straight out of the side. So they were sticking straight down, so we're going to make sure that we bend them completely to stick straight out the side. And you'll probably have to bend them a couple of times to get them perfectly straight and get them to line up just right, but this is going to make it a lot easier for us to connect to those male-female header socket pins, which are sitting there on the table. OK. So we're bending all these out and what we can do is, once we've got those bent out-- it's important, also, that they're all sort of bent out at the same angle. You don't want them sticking in a whole bunch of different directions. You want them all reasonably the same. So when we push this down, we can tell that there's still a little bit that we can bend those to get them perfectly horizontal. They should be at the same plane-- they should be in the same plane as the actual arduino board. So perfectly horizontal, and that'll make it a lot easier to make our solder connections with our male-female socket pin connectors, or header pin connectors that are, again, sitting on the table there. So now that we've got all that bent out, we're going to take our alligator clips, or the helping hand clips, and we're going to hold our arduino in place. Now, if you're working with a partner, you can get them to take a pliers and hold the o in place. Just be sure when you grab the o that you only touch the very corners, the parts that you see the little holes on. You don't want to squeeze any of the components. You see a lot of little boxes on the back there-- those are components. And if you grab those with a alligator clip or pliers, you could break them off and that means that the chip won't work the way it's supposed to-- or, the board won't work the way it's supposed to, I should say. So once you have the piece, you should have the pins from the header pin-- the male-female header pin-- connecting to the pins from your arduino. They should be flush up against the pins from the arduino. So what I'm doing now is I'm just using some spare alligator clips to make sure that those two things are squeezed tightly against one another, and then I'm going to take my soldering iron and put a little bit of solder on it, and just knock that extra solder off again. We're just tinning the tip of the soldering iron. And then I'm going to put the soldering iron right on the joint between those two things, and just put enough solder on to make sure that there's good connection. You don't want to put too much solder, because if you bridge the joint between the two pins-- in other words, if you bridge across two different connections, it'll cause some problems for you. The chip won't work the way it's supposed to. So you want to put just enough solder to connect the two, but not a whole lot more. And you can see that smoke from the flux is moving out of the way rapidly, and that's because I've got a good air flow, so I definitely recommend making sure you've got, like, a fan going or something so you don't breathe the flux. And so once you've got a number of those connected you can take that final alligator clip off. And I just saw a pin there that needed a little bit more solder, and we'll do the rest there. So now, all of those pins are connected and what we've done is-- I'm just going back through and double checking any of the other pins. This is the second side, so I did the second side the exact same way as the first side. And so that means now that we can easily swap out the two. And so I'm trimming off the excess wires. There's some wire that sticks past the solder joint. So I'm going to trim that off using the nipper pliers. And when you do this, make sure you're wearing safety glasses. Because those extra little wires can fly off, and you want to make sure you're wearing safety glasses to do that. Now, we have to make sure that the parts that we just connected don't conduct electricity to some part of the board we don't want them to. So we're going to cover over the bottom of our arduino o with electrical tape, and we want to make sure all of those connections we just made are completely covered. Otherwise, they could rub up against some part of the motor controller or another exposed metal piece and cause a short. And that might ruin our board and we don't want that to happen. So now we're ready to connect our arduino board to our motor controller.",science_electrical-engineering_robots
" We want to test the hypothesis that more than 30% of U.S. households have internet access with a significance level of 5%. We collect a sample of 150 households, and find that 57 have access. So to do our hypothesis test, let's just establish our null hypothesis and our alternative hypothesis. So our null hypothesis is that the hypothesis is not correct. Our null hypothesis is that the proportion of U.S. households that have internet access is less than or equal to 30%. And our alternative hypothesis, is what our hypothesis actually is, is that the proportion is greater than 30%. We see it over here. We want to test the hypothesis that more than 30% of U.S. households have internet access. That's that right here. This is what we're testing. We're testing the alternative hypothesis. And the way we're going to do it is we're going to assume a P-value based on the null hypothesis. We're going to assume a proportion based on the null hypothesis for the population. And the given that assumption, what is the probability that 57 out of 150 of our samples actually have internet access. And if that probability is less than 5%, if it's less than our significance level, then we're going to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative one. So let's think about this a little bit. So we're going to start off assuming-- we're going to assume the null hypothesis is true. And in that assumption we're going to have to pick a population proportion or a population mean-- we know that for Bernoulli distributions do the same thing. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to pick a proportion so high so that it maximizes the probability of getting this over here. And we actually don't even know what that number is. And actually so that we can think about a little more intelligent, let's just find out what our sample proportion even is. We had 57 people out of 150 having internet access. So 57 households out of 150. So our sample proportion is 0.38, so let me write that over here. Our sample proportion is equal to 0.38. So when we assume our null hypothesis to be true, we're going to assume a population proportion that maximizes the probability that we get this over here. So the highest population proportion that's within our null hypothesis that will maximize the probability of getting this is actually if we are right at 30%. So if we say our population proportion, we're going to assume this is true. This is our null hypothesis. We're going to assume that it is 0.3 or 30%. And I want you understand that-- 29% would have been a null hypothesis. 28% that would have been a null hypothesis. But for 29% or 28%, the probability of getting this would have been even lower. So it wouldn't have been as strong of a test. If we take the maximum proportion that still satisfies our null hypothesis, we're maximizing the probability that we get this. So if that number is still low, if it's still less than 5%, we can feel pretty good about the alternative hypothesis. So just to refresh ourselves we're going to assume a population proportion of 0.3, and if we just think about the distribution-- sometimes it's helpful to draw these things, so I will draw it. So this is what the population distribution looks like based on our assumption, based on this assumption right over here. Our population distribution has-- or maybe I should write 30% have internet access. And I'll signify that with a 1. And then the rest don't have internet access. 70% do not have internet access. This is just a Bernoulli distribution. We know that the mean over here is going to be the same thing as the proportion that has internet access. So the mean over here is going to be 0.3, same thing as 30%. This is the population mean. And maybe I should write this way. The mean assuming our null hypothesis, the population mean assuming our null hypothesis is 0.3. And then the population standard deviation. Let me write this over here in yellow. The population standard deviation assuming our null hypothesis. And we've seen this when we first learned about Bernoulli distributions. It is going to be the square root of the percentage of the population that has internet access, so 0.3 times the proportion of the population that does not have internet access, times 0.7 right over here. So this is the square root of 0.21. And we could deal with this later using our calculator. Now, with that out of the way, we want to figure out the probability of getting a sample proportion that has a 0.38. So let's look at the distribution of sample proportions. So you could literally look at every combination of getting 150 households from this, and you would actually get a binomial distribution. And we've also seen this before. You would actually get a binomial distribution where you'd get a bunch of bars like that. But if your n is suitably large, and in particular-- and this is kind of the test for it-- the test if n times p-- and in this case we're saying p is 30%-- if n times p is greater than 5, and n times 1 minus p is greater than 5, you can assume that the distribution of the sample proportion or the sample proportion distribution is going to be normal. So if you looked at all of the different ways you could sample 150 households from this population, you get all of these bars. But since our n is pretty big, it's 150, and 150 times 0.3 is obviously greater than 5. 150 times 0.7 is also greater than 5. You can approximate that with a normal distribution. So let me do that. So you can approximate it with a normal distribution. So this is a normal distribution right over there. Now the mean of the distribution of the proportion data that we're assuming is a normal distribution is going to be-- and remember, working under the context that the null hypothesis is true. So this mean is going to be-- this mean right here-- so the mean of our sample proportions is going to be the same thing as our population mean. So this is going to be 0.3, same value as that. And the standard deviation--- this comes straight from the central limit theorem. So the standard deviation of our sample proportions, the standard deviation is going to be the square root-- let me put it this way-- it's going to be our population standard deviation, the standard deviation we're assuming with our null hypothesis divided by the square root of the number of samples we have. And in this case we have 150 samples. It's going to be 150 samples and we can calculate this. This value on top we just figured out is the square root of 0.21. So this is the square root of 0.21 over the square root of 150. And I can get the calculator out to calculate this. So I'll just do it the way I wrote it. The square root of 0.21-- and I'm going to divide that, so whatever answer is I'm going to divide that by the square root of 150. So it's 0.037. So we figured out the standard deviation here of our-- or the distribution of our sample proportions is going to be-- let me write this down, I'll scroll over to the right a little bit-- it is 0.037. I think I'm falling off the screen a little bit. So we'll just say 0.037. Now to figure out the probability of having a sample proportion of 0.38, we just have to figure out how many standard deviations that is away from our mean, or essentially calculate a Z-statistic for our sample, because a Z-statistic or a Z-score is really just how many standard deviations you are away from the mean. And then figure out whether the probability of getting that Z-statistic is more or less than 5%. So let's figure out how many standard deviations we are away from the mean. So just remind ourselves, this sample proportion we got we can view as just a sample from this distribution of all of the possible sample proportions. So how many standard deviations away from the mean is this? So if we take our sample proportion, subtract from that the mean of the distribution of sample proportions and divide it by the standard deviation of the distribution of the sample proportions, we get 0.38, 0.38 minus 0.3. 1All of that over this value which we just 1figured out was 0.037. 1So what does that give us? 1The numerator over here is a 0.08. 1The denominator is 0.037. 1So let's figure this out. 1So our numerator is 0.08 divided by this last number 1right here, which is the 0.037. 1So second answer and we get 2.1-- I'll just round it to 12.14 standard deviations. 1So this is equal to-- this right here is equal to 2.14 1standard deviations. 1Or we could say that our Z-statistic, right, we could 1call this our Z-score or our Z-statistic, the number of 1standard deviations we are away from our mean is 2.14. 1We're at 2.14, and to be exact, we're 2.14 standard 1deviations above the mean. 1We're going to care about a one-tailed distribution. 1Now is the probability of getting this more 1or less than 5%? 1If it's less than 5% we're going to reject the null 1hypothesis in favor of our alternative. 1So how do we think about that? 1Well let's think about just a normalized normal 1distribution. 1Or maybe you could call the Z-distribution if you want. 1If you look at a normal distribution, a completely 1normalized normal distribution, 1it's mean is at 0. 1And essentially each of these values 1are essentially Z-scores. 1Because a value of 1 literally means you are 1 standard 1deviation away from this mean over here. 1So we need to find a critical Z-value right over here. 1Let me call that a critical Z-- we could even say critical 1Z-score or critical Z-value-- so that the probability of 1getting a Z-value higher than that is 5%. 1So that this whole area right here is 5%. 1And that's because that's what our significance level is. 1Anything that has a lower than 5% a chance of occurring, for 1us will be validation to reject our null hypothesis. 1Or another way of thinking about it is that area's 5%, 1this whole area right over here is 95%. 1And once again, this is a one-tailed test, because we 1only care about values greater than this. 1Z-values greater than that will make us reject the null 1hypothesis. 1And to figure out this critical Z-value you can 1literally just go to a Z-table. 1And we say OK, the probability of being a Z-value less than 1that is 95%. 1And that's exactly the number that this gives us. 1The cumulative probability of getting a 1value less than that. 1So if we just scan this, we're looking for 95%. 1We have 0.9495, we have 0.9505. 1So I'll go with this just to make sure we're 1a little bit closer. 1So this Z-value, and the z-value here is 1.6, and the 1next digit is 5. 11.6 5. 1So this critical Z-value is equal to 1.65. 1So the probability of getting a Z-value less than 1.65, or 1even in a completely normalized normal 1distribution, the probability of getting a 1value less than 1.65. 1Or in any normal distribution, the probability of being less 1than 1.65 standard deviations away from the mean 1is going to be 95%. 1So that's our critical Z-value. 1Now does Z-value, or the Z-statistic, for our actual 1sample is 2.14. 1Our actual Z-value we got is 2.14. 1It's sitting all the way out here some place. 1So the probability of getting that was 1definitely less than 5%. 1And actually we could even say what's the probability of 1getting that or a more extreme result. 1And if you figured out this area, and you could actually 1figure it out by looking at a Z-table, you could figure out 1the P-value of this result. 1But anyway, the whole exercise here is just to figure out if 1can reject the null hypothesis with a significance level 5%. 1We can. 1This is a more extreme result than our critical Z-value, so 1we can reject the null hypothesis in favor of our 1alternative.",math_statistics-probability_significance-tests-one-sample
" Find the slope of the line that goes through the ordered pairs 7, negative 1 and negative 3, negative 1. Let me just do a quick graph of these just so we can visualize what they look like. So let me draw a quick graph over here. So our first point is 7, negative 1. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. This is the x-axis. 7, negative 1. So it's 7, negative 1 is right over there. 7, negative 1. This, of course, is the y-axis. And then the next point is negative 3, negative 1. So we go back 3 in the horizontal direction. Negative 3 for the y-coordinate is still negative 1. So the line that connects these two points will look like this. It will look like that. Now, they're asking us to find the slope of the line that goes through the ordered pairs. Find the slope of this line. And just to give a little bit of intuition here, slope is a measure of a line's inclination. And the way that it's defined-- slope is defined as rise over run, or change in y over change in x, or sometimes you'll see it defined as the variable m. And then they'll define change in y as just being the second y-coordinate minus the first y-coordinate and then the change in x as the second x-coordinate minus the first x-coordinate. These are all different variations in slope, but hopefully you'll appreciate that these are measuring inclination. If I rise a ton when I run a little bit, if I move a little bit in the x direction, and I rise a bunch, then I have a very steep line. I have a very steep upward-sloping line. If I don't change at all when I run a bit, then I have a very low slope. And that's actually what's happening here. I'm going from-- you could either view this as the starting point or view this as the starting point. But let's view this as the starting point. So this negative 3, 1. If I go from negative 3, negative 1 to 7, negative 1, I'm running a good bit. I'm going from negative 3. My x value is negative 3 here, and it goes all the way to 7. So my change in x here is 10. To go from negative 3 to 7, I changed my x value by 10. But what's my change in y? Well, my y value here is negative 1, and my y value over here is still negative 1. So my change in y is a 0. My change in y is going to be 0. My y value does not change no matter how much I change my x value. So the slope here is going to be-- when we run 10, what was our rise? How much did we change in y? Well, we didn't rise at all. We didn't go up or down. So the slope here is 0. Or another way to think about is this line has no inclination. It's a completely flat-- it's a completely horizontal line. So this should make sense. This is a 0. The slope here is 0. And just to make sure that this gels with all of these other formulas that you might know-- but I want to make it very clear. These are all just telling you rise over run or change in y over change in x, a way to measure inclination. But let's just apply them just so, hopefully, it all makes sense to you. So we could also say slope is change in y over change in x. If we take this to be our start and if we take this to be our end point, then we would call this over here x1. And then this is over here. This is y1. And then we would call this x2 and we would call this y2, if this is our start point and that is our end point. And so the slope here, the change in y, y2 minus y1. So it's negative 1 minus negative 1, all of that over x2, negative 3, minus x1, minus 7. So the numerator, negative 1 minus negative 1, that's the same thing as negative 1 plus 1. And our denominator is negative 3 minus 7, which is negative 10. So once again, negative 1 plus 1 is 0 over negative 10. And this is still going to be 0. And the only reason why we got a negative 10 here and a positive 10 there is because we swapped the starting and the ending point. In this example right over here, we took this as the start point and made this coordinate over here as the end point. Over here, we swapped them around. 7, negative 1 was our start point, and negative 3, negative 1 is our end point. So if we start over here, our change in x is going to be negative 10. But our change in y is still going to be 0. So regardless of how you do it, the slope of this line is 0. It's a horizontal line.",math_8th-engage-ny_engage-8th-module-4
" In the last video, we hopefully set up some of the intuition for why - or I should say what - the Maclaurin series is all about, and I said at the end of the videos that a Maclaurin series is just a special case of a Taylor series. In the case of a Maclaurin series, we're approximating this function around x is equal to 0, and a Taylor series, and we'll talk about that in a future video, you can pick an arbitrary x value - or f(x) value, we should say, around which to approximate the function. But with that said, let's just focus on Maclaurin, becuase to some degree it's a little bit simpler, and that by itself can lead us to some pretty profound conclusions about mathematics, and that's actually where I'm trying to get to. So let's take the Maclurin series of some interesting functions and I'm gonna do functions where it's pretty easy to take the derivatives, and you can /keep/ taking their derivatives over and over and over and over and over again. So let's take the Maclaurin series of cosine of x, so if f(x)=cos(x), then - before I even apply this formula, that we somewhat derived in the last video, or at least got the intuitive for in the last video - let's take a bunch of derivatives of f(x), just so we have a good sense of it. So, if we take the first derivative, if we take the first derivative, derivative of cos(x) = -sin(x) if we take the derivative of that, if we take the derivative of that, derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), and we have the negative there, so it's -cos(x) so if we take the derivative of that, so this is the third derivative of cos(x), now it's just going to be positive sine of x, and if we take the derivative of that, we get cos(x) again. We get cosine of x again. So if we take the derivative of that, this is the fourth derivative, I should, I should use this notation but you get the idea, we'll get cos(x) again. And if you look at what we talked about in the last video, we want the difference - we want the function, and we want it's various derivatives evaluated at 0, so let's evaluate it at 0. So f(0), cos(0) is 1, cosine of zero is one. Whether you're talking about zero radians or zero degrees, doesn't matter, sine of zero is zero, so this is f prime of - f prime of zero, is zero. And then cos(0) is, once again, one, but we have the negative out there, so it becomes negative one. So f - the second derivative evaluated at zero is negative one. Let's take the third derivative, the third derivative evaluated at zero well, sine of zero is just zero, and then the fourth derivative evaluated at zero, cosine of zero is one. So f prime prime prime at zero is now equal to one. So you see an interesting pattern here - one, zero, negative one, zero, one, then you go to zero, then you go to negative one, zero. So if we were to apply this to find it's Maclaurin representation, what would we get? Let me do my best attempt at this. So we would get, our polynomial would be - so our polynomial approximation of cosine of x is going to be f(0), f(0) is one, and then we have one plus f'(0) times x. But f'(0) is just zero, so we're not going to have this term over there, it's going to be zero times x, I won't even take the trouble of writing it down, it would be this zero time x, then plus f prime prime or second derivative, which is negative one, so I'll write negative - negative, this is a negative one right here, this is a negative one, times x squared, times x squared, over 2 factorial - over two factorial, which in this case is just going to be two. But I'll just write it down here as two factorial, to make the pattern a little bit more obvious, and then we go to the next term, the third derivative evaluated at zero but the third derivative evaluated at zero is just zero, so this term won't be there as well, then you go to the fourth derivative, the fourth derivative evaluated at zero is positive one, so this coefficient right here is going to be a one, and so you're going to have one times x to the fourth over four factorial, so plus x to the fourth over four factorial, and I think you start seeing a pattern now. You have sign switches - and you would see this if we kept going, so you can verify it for yourself if you don't believe me - so you have a positive sign, a negative sign, a positive sign, and then a negative sign, so on and so forth, and this is, uh, one times x to the zeroth power, then you jump two to x to the squared, jump two to x to the fourth, and so if we kept that up, we'd have a positive sign, now we have a negative sign, it would be x to the sixth over six factorial, then you have a positive sign, x to the eighth over eight factorial, and then you'd have a negative sign, x to the tenth over ten factorial, and you can just keep going that way. And if you kept going with this series, this would be the polynomial representation of cosine of x. And it's frankly just kind of cool that if can be represented this way. It's a pretty simple pattern here for a trigonometric function. Once again, it kind of tells you that all of this math is connected. And we'll see, two or three videos from now, it's connected in far more profound ways then you can possibly imagine.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-series
" In this video, we're going to see how induction and resoce affect the activating strength of substituents on a benzene ring, but before we get to substituents let's real quickly review the mechanism for electrophilic aromatic substitution involving benzene. And so the benzene ring is going to function as a nucleophile so all the pi electrons in the benzene ring are negatively charged, of course, and they're attracted to positively charged things, like an electrophile. And so the benzene ring is going to function as a nucleophile, and some of these pi electrons are going to form a bond with our electrophile. So we get nucleophile attacking the electrophile, and the electrophile is going to add on to our ring. And I'm just going to say the electrophile adds on to this carbon right here, which means that this carbon has a plus 1 formal charge, and that will represent our positively charged sigma complex. So if you could imagine a substituent on our benzene ring that somehow increased the electron density in that ring, that would make that benzene ring even more nucleophilic, and that increased electron density would help to stabilize the positively-charged sigma complex, which means the sigma complex is more likely to form. And so a substituent that increases electron density we could call that an electron donating group, and an electron donating group would activate the ring towards electrophilic aromatic substitution, which means that the overall rate of the reaction will be faster than that compared to benzene. And so we call an electron donating group an activator. So let me go ahead and write an activator here. If we thought about the opposite situation, if we thought about a substituent on the ring that overall decreased the electron density in that ring, the ring would not be as nucleophilic, and you could think about the ring as being a little more positively charged and so that would, of course, destabilized the positively-charged sigma complex. And so a substituent that overall decreased the electron density in the ring, and we could say it's an electron withdrawing group because it's withdrawing electron density from the ring. And that would, of course, deactivate the ring towards electrophilic aromatic substitution, and so we would call this a deactivator, and so the reaction would be slower than that of benzene by itself. Let's see how the concepts of electron donating groups and electron withdrawing groups affect activating strength. And we'll start with strong activators here. So first we can look at the phenyl molecule, and we can think about this carbon on our ring in a sigma bond to this oxygen right here. We know oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, and so the oxygen can withdraw some electron density from the ring by in inductive effect, right? So oxygen being more electronegative, it can pull the electrons through that sigma bond closer to itself. And so it's withdrawing some electron density from the ring because of electronegativity, and so we call this induction or the inductive effect. So there's some induction in this molecule. Now, since it's withdrawing some electron density, you might expect the OH group to be a deactivator, but that's not what we observe. We observe the OH to be a strong activator. And so there must be another effect here to counteract this inductive effect, and, of course, that effect is resoce. So let me go ahead and write resoce right over here. So we can draw several resoce structures for the phenyl molecule, but if you think about this lone pair of electrons on this oxygen, it's right next to our benzene ring. And so this lone pair of electrons can participate in resoce and move in here to form a pi bond, which would push these electrons in here off onto this carbon so we can go ahead and draw a pi bond between our oxygen and our carbon now. There's still a lone pair of electrons on that oxygen, it's still bonded to a hydrogen so it has a plus 1 formal charge. And so we have these pi electrons here and we have these electrons move out on to this carbon, which gives that carbon a negative 1 formal charge. And we could keep drawing more resoce structures, but I'm going to stop there because the point that I'm trying to make is that we get to some donation of electron density to the ring through a pi bond. So let me go ahead and highlight our pi bond here. So these electrons move in here to form a pi bond between that carbon and that oxygen, and so we get overlap of P orbitals between this carbon and this oxygen. So let me go ahead and sketch that really fast. So we have a carbon and we have an oxygen, and we're going to get overlap of P orbitals. Since carbon and oxygen are on the same period on the periodic table, their P orbitals are pretty much the same size, and that means that you get good overlap and therefore, the oxygen is able to donate some electron density to that ring there. So the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen is conjugated into the pi system of that ring, and so that's overall, an electron donating effect, right? You're increasing the electron density in the ring, and so the resoce effect says that the OH group is an electron donating group, which would, of course, make it a strong activator. And that's, of course, what we observe experimentally. And so we can say that the resoce effect beats the inductive effect when you're talking about a strong activator here, so an atom that has a lone pair of electrons next to your benzene ring. Now, the same idea holds true for amylin down here. So once again, thinking about nitrogen compared it to this carbon, that nitrogen is more electronegative and so it's going to withdraw some electron density from the ring via the inductive effect through that sigma bond. So I can think about drawing an arrow showing the movement of electrons towards nitrogen. Now, nitrogen is not as electronegative as oxygen there so it's not really withdrawing quite as much electron density via induction. Since that nitrogen has a lone pair of electrons on it, it can also participate in resoce. And so just like the previous example, I could take this lone pair of electrons right next to the ring, move it into here to form a pi bond to push these electrons in here off onto that carbon. So I could go ahead and show one possible resoce structure here. So I could show my pi bond between my carbon and my nitrogen. The nitrogen would now be positively charged, and we would have a lone pair of electrons on this carbon, which would make that carbon negatively charged. And once again, you could draw more resoce structures, but we just don't have the time for that in this video. And so once again, this lone pair of electrons is actually conjugated into the pi system of the ring right there. And so that's increasing the electron density of the ring, which makes the ring more nucleophilic, stabilized the positively-charged sigma complex, and therefore, it's overall an electron-donating a group, which makes it an activator. And we could also think about the P orbitals of this carbon and this nitrogen so they are also, of course, in the same period on the periodic table so when you sketch in your P orbitals here you can make them pretty much the same size, and so you get good overlap of those P orbitals. Now, amylin is actually even more reactive than the phenyl example, and that's because of the nitrogen being less electronegative than oxygen. And so in the pi bond here since this nitrogen-- let me go ahead and highlight our pi electrons, let's use green this time-- so these pi electrons right here, since nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen that means that those pi electrons are better able to be conjugated into the pi system of the ring since the nitrogen isn't pulling on them as much as the oxygen is. And so since you get a little bit more electron density donated to your ring because of the nitrogen being less electronegative that means increase electron density makes this a better electron-donating group, which activates the ring better towards electrophilic aromatic substitution. And so in the next video, we're going to use the same concepts of induction and resoce, and we're going to analyze a moderate activator, a weak activator, and we'll also look at an example of a weak deactivator that is still an ortho/para director.",science_organic-chemistry_aromatic-compounds
" -  Let's see if we can simplify this expression. So pause the video and have a try at it, and then we're gonna do it together right now. All right, so when you look at this, it looks like both the numerator and denominator, they might, you might be able to factor them, and maybe they have some common factors that you can divide the numerator and the denominator by to simplify it. So let's first try to factor the numerator. X to the fourth, plus eight x squared, plus seven. At first it might be a little intimidating, because you have an x to the fourth here. It's not a quadratic; it's a fourth degree polynomial, but like any, if you, like a lot of quadratics that we've seen in the past, it does seem to have a pattern. For example, if this said x squared plus eight x plus seven, you'd say, oh, well, this is pretty straightforward to factor. What two numbers add up to eight and when I take their product I get seven? Well, there's only two numbers where you take their product and you get positive seven that are going to be positive, and they need to be positive, if they're going to add up to positive eight, and that's one and seven. So this would be x plus seven times x plus one. Well, if you just think of, instead of thinking in terms of x and x squared, if you just think in terms of x squared and x to the fourth, it's going to be the exact same thing. So this thing can be written as x squared plus seven times x squared plus one. If you want, you can do some type of a substitution saying, saying that a is equaled to x squared, in which case, so if you said that a is equal to x squared, then this thing would become a squared plus eight a plus seven, and then you would factor this into a plus seven and a plus one, and then you would undo the substitution, and that's x squared plus seven and x squared plus one. But hopefully you see what's going on here; this is the higher order term, and then this is half the degree of that, so it fits this mold. And so you could do a substitution, or you could just recognize, oh okay, instead of dealing with x squared, I'm dealing with x to the fourth. All right, so that's the numerator. Now let's think about, let's think about the denominator. So the denominator, both of these terms are divisible by three x. So let's factor out a three x. So it's three x times, three x times, if you factor out a three x here, three divided by three is one, x to the fifth divided by x is x to the fourth, and then if you factor out a three x here, you're just gonna get one. And so far this doesn't seem too helpful. I don't see an x to the fourth minus one, or a three x in the numerator, but maybe I can factor this out further, x to the fourth minus one. And that's because it is a difference of squares. And you might say, wait, I'm always used to recognizing a difference of squares as something like a squared minus one, which you could write as a plus one times a minus one. Well, this would be a squared minus one if you say that a is equal to x squared. Then this would be a squared minus one. So let's rewrite all of this. So let's rewrite. So this is all going to be equal to, same numerator, let's see, let's do it in green. Same numerator: x squared plus seven, can't factor that out any more, times x squared plus one, can't factor that out any more, all of that over three x, but this I can view as a difference of squares. So this is x squared squared, and this is obviously one squared, so this is going to be x squared plus one times x squared minus, times x squared minus one. Now clearly have an x squared in the numerator, x squared minus one in the numerator, x squared, sorry, x squared plus one in the numerator, x squared plus one in the denominator, and so I could cancel them out, and I'm going to be left with, in the numerator, x squared plus seven, over three x times x squared minus one. Now, this looks pretty simple, and we want to be a little careful, because whenever we do this cancelling out we don't want, we want to make sure that we restrict the xes for which the expression's defined, if we want them to be algebraically equivalent. So this one, would this be, this would obviously be undefined, so x cannot be equal to zero, x cannot be equal to plus or minus one. Positive or negative one would make this expression right over here equal zero, so it cannot be equal to zero, x cannot be equal to, I'll write plus or minus one; that would make this part zero. But this right over here, this one, unless, we're assuming we're dealing only with real numbers, this one can't ever equal zero if you're dealing with real numbers, because x squared is always going to be non-negative and you're adding it to a positive value, and so this part, this factor, would have never made the entire thing undefined. So we can actually just factor it out, or cancel it out, without worrying much about it. And so this is actually algebraically equivalent to what we had originally. Now we could write these constraints on it, if we want. If someone were to ask me, you know, for what x is this expression not defined, well, it's clear it's not defined for x, that would make the denominator zero, dividing by zero not defined, or if x is plus or minus one, it would make the denominator equal zero. But that is, that comes straight of this expression, so this expression and our original expression are algebraically equivalent. Now if you wanted to, you could expand the bottom out a little bit, you could multiply it out if you like. That's equivalent to, so x squared plus seven over three x times x squared is three x to the third minus three x. So these are all, these are all equivalent expressions, and we are done.",math_algebra-home_alg-rational-expr-eq-func
"  Now let's start to do some more interesting problems. And one of these things that you'll find in probability is that you can always do a more interesting problem. So now I'm going to think about-- I'm going to take a fair coin, and I'm going to flip it three times. And I want to find the probability of at least one head out of the three flips. So the easiest way to think about this is how many equally likely possibilities there are. In the last video, we saw if we flip a coin 3 times, there's 8 possibilities. For the first flip, there's 2 possibilities. Second flip, there's 2 possibilities. And in the third flip, there are 2 possibilities. So 2 times 2 times 2-- there are 8 equally likely possibilities if I'm flipping a coin 3 times. Now how many of those possibilities have at least 1 head? Well, we drew all the possibilities over here. So we just have to count how many of these have at least 1 head. So that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So 7 of these have at least 1 head in them. And this last one does not. So 7 of the 8 have at least 1 head. Now you're probably thinking, OK, Sal. You were able to do it by writing out all of the possibilities. But that would be really hard if I said at least one head out of 20 flips. This had worked well because I only had 3 flips. Let me make it clear, this is in 3 flips.  This would have been a lot harder to do or more time consuming to do if I had 20 flips. Is there some shortcut here? Is there some other way to think about it? And you couldn't just do it in some simple way. You can't just say, oh, the probability of heads times the probability of heads, because if you got heads the first time, then now you don't have to get heads anymore. Or you could get heads again-- you don't have to. So it becomes a little bit more complicated. But there is an easy way to think about it where you could use this methodology right over here. You'll actually see this on a lot of exams where they make it seem like a harder problem, but if you just think about in the right way, all of a sudden it becomes simpler. One way to think about it is the probability of at least 1 head in 3 flips is the same thing-- this is the same thing-- as the probability of not getting all tails, right? If we got all tails, then we don't have at least 1 head. So these two things are equivalent. The probability of getting at least 1 head in 3 flips is the same thing as the probability of not getting all tails in 3 flips.  So what's the probability of not getting all tails? Well, that's going to be 1 minus the probability of getting all tails. The probability of getting all tails, since it's 3 flips, it's the probability of tails, tails, and tails. Because any of the other situations are going to have at least 1 head in them. And that's all of the other possibilities, and then this is the only other leftover possibility. If you add them together, you're going to get 1. Let me write it this way. Let me write it a new color just so you see where this is coming from. The probability of not all tails plus the probability of all tails-- well, this is essentially exhaustive. This is all of the possible circumstances. So your chances of getting either not all tails or all tails-- and these are mutually exclusive, so we can add them. The probability of not all tails or, just to be clear what we're doing, the probability of not all tails or the probability of all tails is going to be equal to one. These are mutually exclusive. You're either going to have not all tails, which means a head shows up. Or you're going to have all tails. But you can't have both of these things happening. And since they're mutually exclusive and you're saying the probability of this or this happening, you could add their probabilities. And this is essentially all of the possible events. So this is essentially, if you combine these, this is the probability of any of the events happening. And that's going to be a 1 or 100% chance. So another way to think about is the probability of not all tails is going to be 1 minus the probability of all tails. So that's what we did right over here. And the probability of all tails is pretty straightforward. That's the probability of it's going to be 1/2, because you have a 1/2 chance of getting a tails on the first flip, times-- let me write it here, so we can have it a little clearer. So this is going to be 1 minus the probability of getting all tails. You will have a 1/2 chance of getting tails on the first flip, and then you're going to have to get another tails on the second flip, and then you're going to have to get another tails on the third flip. And then 1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2. This is going to be 1/8. And then 1 minus 1/8 or 8/8 minus 1/8 is going to be equal to 7/8. So we can apply that to a problem that is harder to do than writing all of the scenarios like we did in the first problem.  Let's say we have 10 flips, the probability of at least one head in 10 flips-- well, we use the same idea. This is going to be equal to the probability of not all tails in 10 flips.  So we're just saying the probability of not getting all of the flips going to be tail. All of the flips is tails-- not all tails in 10 flips. And this is going to be 1 minus the probability of flipping tails 10 times. So it's 1 minus 10 tails in a row.  And so this is going to be equal to this part right over here. Let me write this. So this is going to be this one. Let me just rewrite it. This is equal to 1 minus-- and this part is going to be, well, one tail, another tail. So it's 1/2 times 1/2. And I'm going to do this 10 times.  Let me write this a little neater. 1/2-- so that's 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. And so we really just have to-- the numerator is going to be 1. So this is going to be 1. This is going to be equal to 1. Let me do it in that same color of green. This is going to be equal to 1 minus-- our numerator, you just have 1 times itself 10 times. So that's 1. And then on the denominator, you have 2 times 2 is 4. 4 times 2 is 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1,024-- over 1,024. This is the exact same thing as 1 is 1024 over 1024 minus 1 over 1024, which is equal to 1,023 over 1,024. We have a common denominator here. So 1,000-- I'm doing that same blue-- over 1,024. So if you flip a coin 10 times in a row-- a fair coin-- you're probability of getting at least 1 heads in that 10 flips is pretty high. It's 1,023 over 1,024. And you can get a calculator out to figure that out in terms of a percentage. Actually, let me just do that just for fun. So if we have 1,023 divided by 1,024 that gives us-- you have a 99.9% chance that you're going to have at least one heads. So this is if we round. This is equal to 99.9% chance. And I rounded a little bit. It's actually slightly, even slightly, higher than that. And this is a pretty powerful tool or a pretty powerful way to think about it because it would have taken you forever to write all of the scenarios down. In fact, there would have been 1,024 scenarios to write down. So doing this exercise for 10 flips would have taken up all of our time. But when you think about in a slightly different way, when you just say, look the probability of getting at least 1 heads in 10 flips is the same thing as the probably of not getting all tails. And that's 1 minus the probability of getting all tails. And this is actually a pretty easy thing to think about. ",math_precalculus_prob-comb
" -  ""f is a finite function whose domain is the letters a to e. The following table lists the output for each input in f's domain."" So if x is equal to a then, so if we input a into our function then we output -6. f of a is -6. We input b we get three, we input c we get -6, we input d we get two, we input e we get -6. ""Build the mapping diagram for f by dragging the endpoints of the segments in the graph below so that they pair each domain element with its correct range element. Then, determine if f is invertible."" Alright, so let's see what's going on over here. Let me scroll down a little bit more. So in this purple oval, this is representing the domain of our function f and this is the range. So the function is going to, if you give it a member of the domain it's going to map from that member of domain to a member of the range. So, for example, you input a into the function it goes to -6. So a goes to -6, so I drag that right over there. b goes to three, c goes to -6, so it's already interesting that we have multiple values that point to -6. So this is okay for f to be a function but we'll see it might make it a little bit tricky for f to be invertible. So let's see, d is points to two, or maps to two. So you input d into our function you're going to output two and then finally e maps to -6 as well. e maps to -6 as well. So, that's a visualization of how this function f maps from a through e to members of the range but also ask ourselves 'is this function invertible?' And I already hinted at it a little bit. Well in order fo it to be invertible you need a, you need a function that could take go from each of these points to, they can do the inverse mapping. But it has to be a function. So, if you input three into this inverse function it should give you b. If you input two into this inverse function it should output d. If you input -6 into this inverse function, well this hypothetical inverse function. what should it do? Well you can't have a function that if you input one, if you input a number it could have three possible values, a, c, or e, you can only map to one value. So there isn't, you actually can't set up an inverse function that does this because it wouldn't be a function. You can't go from input -6 into that inverse function and get three different values. So this is not invertible. Let's do another example. So here, so this is the same drill. We have our members of our domain, members of our range. We can build our mapping diagram. a maps to -36, b maps to nine. c maps to -4, d maps to 49, and then finally e maps to 25. e maps to 25. Now is this function invertible? Well let's think about it. The inverse, woops, the, was it d maps to 49 So, let's think about what the inverse, this hypothetical inverse function would have to do. It would have to take each of these members of the range and do the inverse mapping. So if you input 49 into our inverse function it should give you d. Input 25 it should give you e. Input nine it gives you b. You input -4 it inputs c. You input -36 it gives you a. So you could easily construct an inverse function here. So this is very much, this is very much invertible. One way to think about it is these are a, this is a one to one mapping. Each of the members of the domain correspond to a unique member of the range. You don't have two members of the domain pointing to the same member of the range. Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting.",math_engageny-precalc_precalc-3
" - We're now going to talk about one of the most famous operons, and this is the lac operon, and it is part of E. coli's genome and it is involved. And the lac right over here is referring to lactose, and so you can imagine that it codes for genes involved in the metabolism of lactose. And the word lactose might already be familiar to you. It is a sugar found in milk. Some of us, including myself, are lactose intolerant. I have trouble digesting lactose, so I have mixed feelings regarding this. But in general, for a cell to make use of it, it needs to be able to absorb the lactose. It needs to be able to split it up into simpler sugars that it can actually use for fuel, and that is what the genes in the lac operon actually do code for. So just as an example, the lac Z gene right over here, this codes for an enzyme that helps cleave the lactose into simpler sugars. The lac Y gene codes for an enzyme that allows for the absorption of lactose through cellular membranes. Lac A is a little bit more interesting and a little less understood, but the general idea here is all three of these are involved in the metabolism and the absorption of lactose. And it is an operon, so we have our promoter here where our RNA polymerase would attach, and I've also drawn some other sites. I've drawn the operator right over here where you can imagine a repressor, indeed the lac repressor could bind, and over here, this CAP site, or C-A-P site. CAP stands for Catabolite Activator Protein. Catabolite, Catabolite Activator, whoops, Activator Protein. And so this is, you can imagine, where a protein, called the Catabolite Activator Protein, can bind and perhaps be an activator. So with that out of the way, let's think about different scenarios. Let's think about a scenario where the E. coli is an environment where there is no lactose. So what do you think should happen over here? And a lot of these things are very logical if you just assume that a lot of biological organisms are quite stingy. They don't wanna just waste resources. Well, if there's no lactose, well, why transcribe the genes that can be translated into enzymes for the metabolism of lactose? So if there's no lactose, you can almost do this as a default state right over here. You actually have the lac repressor protein being bound to the operator. So this is the lac repressor, lac repressor right over there, and so you won't be able to transcribe these things. The RNA polymerase won't be able to get anything done. No transcription is going to occur. So no lactose, no transcription, which makes a lot of sense. The bacteria, or the bacterium, this is singular, doesn't wanna waste resources. So what do you think should happen if there is lactose? So I'll keep this up here so you can see it. So lactose present, lactose present, well, you can imagine, well, you don't want that repressor around anymore, and that is indeed what happens, that you have an isomer of lactose, called Allolactose. So if lactose is present, you're going to have also Allolactose present, right over here, and so that is Allolactose, which can act as an inducer of transcription. And the way that it acts as an inducer is if it binds to the lac repressor, the lac repressor can no longer bind to the operator site. When the Allolactose is present, it will bind to the repressor, and then the repressor is going to leave the operator site. It's not going to be able to bind as well, and so let me draw that. So in this case, the operator, sorry, the repressor I should say. The operator is where the repressor binds. So this is the repressor right over here. You have some Allolactose. We do that in white. You have some Allolactose that has bound to it, and because of that, it's not going to bind to the operator, and since it's not bound to the operator, well now, the RNA polymerase can actually transcribe these genes, and that's valuable because by transcribing these genes, we are going to be able to metabolize this lactose. So lactose present, you have transcription. Transcription occurs. Now that's a very high level simple view of the lac operon, but there's more involved, because there's other sugars, in particular glucose, which is preferred by the cell. So, whoops, moving the wrong part. There you go. So let's think about what will happen in the presence of glucose and not in the presence of glucose. So let me write here. So glucose, and no glucose, actually let me do it, I'll do no glucose first. So let's see, we have no glucose. And remember, glucose is preferred to lactose. Simpler sugar. If you have glucose around, why worry about the lactose? And then here we have glucose. We have glucose around. And we could talk about both of these situations in the presence of lactose or not in the presence of lactose, but if we don't any lactose around, then were not gonna have the Allolactose around, and then you're just gonna have the repressor sit on the operator, and you're not going to have any transcription, and that's going to be whether or not we have glucose. So I'm gonna think about no glucose, but we do have lactose, plus lactose, and in here, you have glucose plus lactose. Well, the lactose part, if we have lactose around then we're going to have the Allolactose around, and we just covered this scenario. The Allolactose binds to the lac repressor, keeps the lac repressor from binding to the operator, and so you have your RNA polymerase is able to actually perform the transcription. But that's not it. In a situation with no glucose, you actually are going to also involve the CAP site. You're going to have an activator that's going to make this happen even more, because if you don't have glucose around, man, you really need that lactose. And so, what you have is something called, so let me draw this, the Catabolite Activator Protein, right over here. The Catabolite Activator Protein, and in the presence of Cyclic AMP, Adenosine Monophosphate. It's a derivative of ATP, and so this is that right over there, Cyclic AMP. You'll see that come up a lot in biology. So this is the Catabolite Activator Protein, in the presence of C AMP, and we'll talk about how Cyclic AMP relates to glucose in a second. In that presence, it is going to bind to this, the CAP site, and it is going to further activate the transcription. So in this situation, no glucose plus lactose, you're going to have even more transcription. So let me write this down. Lots of transcription. Lots of transcription. Now, I know what you're probably asking. This is what I first asked myself when people told me about Cyclic AMP, ""Well, how does Cyclic AMP relate to glucose?"" Well, I'm not gonna go into a huge amount of detail here, but what you need to know here, and it makes sense, is that if you have glucose, so let me write it this way. If you have high glucose, high glucose. I'm having trouble writing. High glucose, then that's going to inhibit the production of Cyclic AMP, so low Cyclic adenosine monophosphate. And if you have low glucose, or no glucose, it's like a tongue twister. If you have low glucose, well, you're not going to inhibit the creation of Cyclic AMP, and so you're going to have high Cyclic AMP. So if you have no glucose, or low glucose, we are in this scenario right over here. You're going to have higher concentrations of Cyclic AMP, which can bind to the Catabolite Activator Protein, which then acts as an activator to allow even more transcription of the lac operon. Which, once again, why is it important? Well, if there's no glucose or low glucose, you're really going to need that lactose. You really wanna transcribe these genes as much as possible. Now, what about the situation where there is glucose and lactose? Well once again, if there is lactose, then you are going to have Allolactose, which is going to be able to bind to the lac repressor, and by it binding to the lac repressor, the lac repressor is not going to be able to bind to the operator. And so you do have, once again, the RNA polymerase is going to be able to transcribe. 1But because you have glucose present, 1you're going to have low or, 1well I'll just write low, 1Cyclic AMP. 1And since you have low or no Cyclic AMP around, 1well, that Cyclic AMP isn't going to be able 1to bind to the Catabolite Activator Protein, 1and so the Catabolite Activator Protein isn't going 1to be able to act as an activator. 1I know I'm using a lot of words multiple times. 1And so it's not going to bond to the activator site, 1or to the CAP site, 1and so you're going to have less transcription. 1Less transcription, 1which once again makes sense. 1You've got glucose and lactose around. 1The cell would prefer to use glucose. 1Simpler sugar. 1Why waste resources? 1You have plenty of energy around, 1just go straight to the glucose. 1But if you don't have glucose around, 1well then use more resources 1so that you can digest the lactose.",science_ap-biology_gene-expression-and-regulation
" What is the type of this quadrilateral? Be as specific as possible with the given data. So it clearly is a quadrilateral. We have four sides here. And we see that we have two pairs of parallel sides. Or we could also say there are two pairs of congruent sides here as well. This side is parallel and congruent to this side. This side is parallel and congruent to that side. So we're dealing with a parallelogram. Let's do more of these. So here it looks like a same type of scenario we just saw in the last one. We have two pairs of parallel and congruent sides, but all the sides aren't equal to each other. If they're all equal to each other, we'd be dealing with a rhombus. But here, they're not all equal to each other. This side is congruent to the side opposite. This side is congruent to the side opposite. That's another parallelogram. Now this is interesting. We have two pairs of sides that are parallel to each other, but now all the sides have an equal length. So this would be a parallelogram. And it is a parallelogram, but they're saying to be as specific as possible with the given data. So saying it's a rhombus would be more specific than saying it's a parallelogram. This does satisfy the constraints for being a parallelogram, but saying it's a rhombus tells us even more. Not every parallelogram is a rhombus, but every rhombus is a parallelogram. Here, they have the sides are parallel to the side opposite and all of the sides are equal. Let's do a few more of these. What is the type of this quadrilateral? Be as specific as possible with the given data . So we have two pairs of sides that are parallel, or I should say one pair. We have a pair of sides that are parallel. And then we have another pair of sides that are not. So this is a trapezoid. But then they have two choices here. They have trapezoid and isosceles trapezoid. Now an isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid where the two non-parallel sides have the same length, just like an isosceles triangle, you have two sides have the same length. Well we could see these two non-parallel sides do not have the same length. So this is not an isosceles trapezoid. If they did have the same length, then we would pick that because that would be more specific than just trapezoid. But this case right over here, this is just a trapezoid. Let's do one more of these. What is the type of this quadrilateral? Well we could say it's a parallelogram because all of the sides are parallel. But if we wanted to be more specific, you could also see that all the sides are the same. So you could say it's a rhombus, but you could get even more specific than that. You notice that all the sides are intersecting at right angles. So this is-- if we wanted to be as specific as possible-- this is a square. Let me check the answer. Got it right.",math_geometry_hs-geo-foundations
" The graph of a function f is shown below. If both the limit of f of x as x approaches k and f of k exist, and f is not continuous at k, then what is the value of k? So we have to find a k where f is not continuous at k, but f of k is defined. And the limit as x approaches k of f of x is also defined. So the easiest ones to spot out just with our eyes might just to be to see where f is not continuous, where f is not continuous. So you see here when x is equal to negative 2, the function is not continuous. It jumps from up here. It looks like it's approaching 3. And then it jumps down to negative 3. So this is one of our candidates. This is one of our candidates for k. The other discontinuity happens when x is equal to 3. Once again, we jump down from-- looks like 4 and a 1/2 all the way to negative 4. So that's another candidate. That's a point where f is not continuous. And then we have when x is equal to 8, we have this. As we approach this, it looks like we're getting to 1. But then we jump right at x equals 8. And then we continue from 1 again. So this is our other candidate. So these are the three candidates where the function is not continuous. Now let's think about which of these points, which of these x values, does f of k exist. So if one of these is k, does f of k exist? Well f of negative 2 exists. f of 3 exists, right over here. That's f of 3. This is f of negative 2. And f of 8, all exist. So all of these potential k's meet this constraint-- f of k exists, and f is not continuous at k. So that's true for x equals 8, 3, or negative 2. Now let's look at this first constraint. The limit of f of x as x approaches k needs to exist. Well, if we tried to look at x equals 2, the limit of f of x as x approaches negative 2-- not 2, as x approaches negative 2 here-- the limit from the left, the limit from values lower than negative 2, it looks like our function is approaching something a little higher. It looks like it's a little higher than 3. And the limit from the right, it looks like our function is approaching negative 3. So this one, the limit does not exist. You get a different limit from the left and from the right. Same thing for x equals positive 3. The limit from the left seems like it's approaching 4 and 1/2, while the limit from the right looks like it's approaching negative 4. So this is also not a candidate. So we only have one left. So for this one, the limit should exist. And we see the limit as f of x as x approaches 8 from the negative direction, it looks like f of x is approaching 1. And it looks like, as we approach 8 from the positive direction, the limit of f of x as x approaches 8 from the positive direction. It's also equal to 1. So your left- and your right-sided limits approach the same value. So the limit of f of x as x approaches 8 is equal to 1. This limit exists. Now, the reason why the function isn't continuous there is that the limit of f of x as x approaches 8, which is equal to 1, it does not equal the value of f of 8. f of 8, we're seeing, is equal to 7. So that's why it meets the last constraint. The function is not continuous there. The function exists. It's defined, f of 8 is equal to 7. And the limit exists. But the limit of f of x as x approaches k is not the same thing, or is not the same as the value of the function evaluated at that point. And so x equals 8 meets all of our constraints. So we could say k is equal to 8.",math_calculus-all-old_limits-and-continuity-calc
" -  In the last video, we were given a multi variable function, and asked to find and classify all of its critical points. So critical points, just means finding where the gradient is equal to zero, and we found four different points for that. I have them down here. They were zero zero, zero negative two, square root of three and one, and negative square root of three and one. So then the next step is to classify those. And that requires the second partial derivative test. So what I'm gonna go ahead and do, is copy down the partial derivatives. Since we already computed those. Copy, and then just kind of paste them down here. Where we can start to use them for the second partial derivatives. So I'm gonna clean things up a little bit, and we don't need this simplification of it. So we've got our partial derivatives. Now since we know we want to apply the second partial derivative test. We've got to first just compute all of the different second partial derivatives of our function. That's just kind of the first thing to do. So let's go ahead and do it. The second partial derivative of the function with respect to x twice in a row. Will take the partial derivative with respect to x, and then do it with respect to x again. So this first term looks like six times a variable times a constant, so it'll just be six times that constant. And then the second term. The derivative of negative six x, is just negative six. Moving right along. When we do the second partial derivative with respect to y twice in a row. We take the partial derivative with respect to y, and then do it again. So this x squared term looks like nothing. It looks like a constant as far as y is concerned so we ignore it. The derivative of negative three y squared is negative six times y, and then the derivative of negative six y is just negative six. And then we can't forget that last crucially important mixed partial derivative term. Which is the partial derivative of f. Where first we do it with respect to x, and then with respect to y. The order doesn't really matter in this case since it's a perfectly ordinary polynomial function. So we could do it either way, but I'm just gonna choose to take a look at this guy and differentiate it with respect to y. So the derivative of the first term with respect to y is six x, six x. And then that second term looks like a constant with respect to y, so that's all we have. So now what we're gonna do is plug in each of the critical points to the special second partial derivative test expression. And to remind you of what that is. That expression is we take the second partial derivative with respect to x twice. And I'll just write it with a kind of shorter notation using subscripts. Then we multiply that by the second partial derivative with respect to x, and then we subtract off. Subtract off the mixed partial derivative term squared. So let's go ahead and do that for each of our points. So when we do this at the point zero zero. Zero zero, what we end up getting. Plugging that into the partial derivative with respect to x twice. Six times zero is zero, so that's just negative six. So that gives us negative six multiplied by. When we plug it into this partial derivative with respect to y squared. Again, that y goes to zero. So we're left with just negative six. And then we subtract off the mixed partial derivative term. Which in this case is zero. Cause when we plug in x equals zero, we get zero. So we're subtracting off zero squared. And that entire thing equals negative six times negative six is 36, 36. And we'll get to analyzing what it means that that's positive in just a moment, but let's just kind of get all of them on the board so we can kind of start doing this with all of them. If we do this with zero and negative two. Zero and negative two. Then once we plug in y equals negative two to this expression. This time I'll write it out. Six times negative two minus six, so that's negative 12 minus six. We'll get negative 18, negative 18. Then when we plug it into the partial derivative of f with respect to y squared. Again, I'll kinda write it out. We have negative six times y is equal to negative two minus six. So now we have negative six times negative two, so that's positive 12 minus six. So that will be a positive six that we plug in here. And then for the mixed partial derivative. Again, x is equal to zero. So the mixed partial derivative is just gonna look like zero when we do this. So we're subtracting off zero squared and we get negative 18 times six. And geez what's 18 times six. So that's gonna be 36 times three. So that's the same as 90. Plus 18, so I think that's 108. Negative 108, and the specific magnitude won't matter. It's gonna be the sign that's important. And this is definitely negative. So now kind of moving right along. These examples can take quite a while. If we plug in square root of three one. Square root of three one, what we get. Now instead of plugging in y equals negative two. We're plugging in y equals one. So that'll be six times one minus six. So the whole thing is just zero. And then for the partial derivative with respect to y squared. Instead of plugging in negative two. Now we're plugging in y equals one. So we have negative six times one minus six so the whole thing is negative 12. So negative 12, and now for the mixed partial derivative term. Which is six x. X is equal to the square root of three. So now we're subtracting off the square root of three squared. So what that equals is, this first part is just entirely zero, and we're subtracting off three. So that's negative three. And then we have square root of three. No, no we don't, that's what we just did. Now we have negative square root of three one. And this will be very similar 'cause this first term just had a y and we plugged in a y. So it's also gonna be zero. For totally the same reasons, and same deal over here. The value of y didn't change. So that's also gonna be negative 12. Doesn't really matter cause we're multiplying it by zero, right? And then over here, now we're plugging in negative square root of three, and that's gonna have the same square. So again we're just subtracting off three. So what does the second partial derivative test tell us? Once we express this term. If it's greater than zero. We have a max or a min. That's what the test tells us. And then if it's less than zero. If it's less than zero we have a saddle point. So in this case, the only term that's greater than zero is this first one, is this first one. And to analyse whether it's a maximum or a minimum. Notice that the partial derivative with respect to x twice in a row, or with respect to y twice in a row was negative. Which indicates a sort of negative concavity. Meaning this corresponds to a maximum. So this guy corresponds to a local maximum. Now all of the other three gave us negative numbers. So all of these other three give us saddle points. Saddle points. So the answer to the question. The original find and classify such and such points is that we found four different critical points. Four different critical points. Zero zero, zero negative two, square root of three one, and negative square root of three one. And all of them are saddle points except for zero zero. Which is a local maximum. And all of that is something that we can tell without even looking at the graph of the function. And with that I will see you next video.",math_multivariable-calculus_applications-of-multivariable-derivatives
" -  So in the previous video we solved this problem the hard way. Maybe you watched it, maybe you didn't, maybe you just skipped right to here and you're like, ""I don't even wanna know the hard way. ""Just show me the easy way please."" Well, that's what we're gonna talk about now. Turns out there's a trick and the trick is after you solve this problem the hard way with a five kilogram mass and a three kilogram mass, when you find the acceleration, what you get is this. That the acceleration of the five kilogram mass is just 29.4 divided by eight kilograms. But when you do enough of these, you might start realizing, ""Wait a minute. 29.4 Newtons. ""That was just the force of gravity ""pulling on this three kilogram mass."" In other words, the only force that was really propelling this whole entire system forward. Or at least the only external force propelling it forward. And then eight kilograms down here. You're gonna be like, ""Wait. Eight kilograms? ""That's just five kilograms plus three kilograms. ""Is that just a coincidence ""or is this telling us something deep and fundamental?"" And it's not a coincidence. Turns out you'll always get this. That what you'll end up with after solving this hard way, you'll get in the very end, you'll get all the external forces added up here where forces that make it go like this force of gravity end up being positive and forces that try to resist the motion. So if there was friction, that would be an external force that tries to resist motion, would be up top and then you get the total mass on the bottom. And this makes sense. The acceleration of this entire system, if we think about it as a single object--- So if you imagine this was just one single object and you asked yourself, ""What's the total acceleration of this entire system?"" Well, it's only gonna depend on the external forces and in this case, the only external force making it go was this force of gravity right here. You might object. You might be like, ""Wait. ""What about this tension right here? ""Isn't the tension pulling on this five kilogram mass ""making this system go?"" It is but since it's an internal force now, if we're treating this entire system as our one object, since this tension is trying to make it go, you've got another tension over here resisting the motion on this mass, trying to make it stop. That's what internal forces do. There's always equal and opposite on one part of the object than the other so you can't propel yourself forward with an internal force. So these end up cancelling out essentially. The only force you have in this case was the force of gravity on top, only external forces, and the total mass on the bottom. And that's trick. That's the trick to quickly find the acceleration of some system that might be complicated if you had to do it in multiple equations and multiple unknowns but much, much easier once you realize this. So the trick, sometimes it's called just ""Treating systems as a single object"". Let me just show you really quick. If that made no sense, let me just show you what this means. If we just get rid of this. So what I'm claiming is this. If you ever have a system where multiple objects are required to move with the exact same magnitude of acceleration, right? Because maybe they're tied together by rope or maybe they're pushing on each other. Maybe there's many boxes in a row and these boxes all have to be pushed at the same acceleration because they can't get pushed through each other. Right, if there's some condition where multiple objects must have the same magnitude of acceleration, then you can simply find the acceleration of that system as if it were a single object. I'm writing, ""SYS"" for system. By just using Newton's second law, but instead of looking at an individual object for a given direction, we're just gonna do all of the external forces, all of the external forces on our system, treat it as if it were a single object, divide it by the total mass of our system. And so when you plug in these external forces--- These are forces that are external so external means not internal to the system. So if I think of this five kilogram box and this three kilogram box as a single mass, tension would be an internal force because it's applied internally between these two objects, between objects inside of our system. But the force of gravity on the three kilogram mass, that's an external force 'cause that's the Earth pulling down on the three kilogram mass and the Earth is not part of our system. Similarly, the normal force is an external force but it's exactly cancelled by the gravitational force. So even though those are external, they're not gonna make it in here. I mean, you can put 'em in there but they're just gonna cancel anyway. We only look at forces in the direction of motion and if it's a force that causes motion, we're gonna make that a positive force. If it's a force in the direction of motion like this force of gravity is, we make those positive forces. So forces will be plugged in positive into here if they make the system go. And that might seem weird. You might be like, ""Wait. ""How do I decide if it makes the system go?"" Well, just ask yourself, ""Is that force directed ""in the same direction as the motion of the system?"" So, we're just saying the system is gonna accelerate if there's forces that make it go and we're gonna plug in negative forces, the forces that make the system stop or resist the motion of system. So maybe I should say, ""Resist motion of the system."" In this case, for this one down here, I don't have any of those. So resist motion of the system. I don't have any of those. I could have if I had a force of friction. Then there'd be a external force that resist the motion. I would plug in that external force as a negative 'cause it resist the motion. So even though this might sound weird, it makes sense if you think about it. The acceleration of our system treated as a single object is only gonna depend on the forces that try to make the system go and the forces that try to make the system stop or resist the motion. So if we add those accordingly with positives and negatives, we divide it by the total mass which gives the total measure of the inertia of our system, we'll get the acceleration of our system. It makes sense and it works. Turns out it always works and it saves a ridiculous amount of time. For instance, if we wanted to do this problem, if you just gave me this problem straight away and you were told, ""Do this however you want."", I would use this trick. And I would say that the acceleration of this system which is composed of this five kilogram mass and our three kilogram mass is just gonna be equal to--- I'd ask myself, ""What force makes this system go? ""What force drives this system?"" And it's this force of gravity on the three kilogram mass that's driving this system, right? If you took this force away, if you eliminated that force, nothing's gonna happen here. This is the force making the system go so I'd put it in my three kilograms times nine point eight. And at this point, you might be like, ""Well, okay, that gravity made it go. ""Should I include this gravity, too?"" But no, that gravity is perpendicular to the motion for one so this gravity isn't making the system, that's just causing this mass to sit on the table and for two, it's cancelled by that normal force. So those cancel anyway, even though they're external forces. This is it, this is the only one that drives the system. So I put that in here and I divide by my total mass 'cause that tells me how much my system resists through inertia, changes in velocity, and this is what I get. I get the same thing I got before, I get back my three point six eight meters per second squared, and I get in one line. I mean, this trick is amazing and it works, and it works in every example where two masses or more masses are forced to move with the same acceleration. So this is great. This'll save you a ton of time. This is supposed to be a three here. And to show you how useful it is, let say there was friction, let's say there was a coefficient of friction of zero point three. Well, now I'd have a frictional force so there'd be an external frictional force here. It'd be applied this five kilogram mass. I'd have to subtract it up here. So if I get rid of this--- So it's not gonna be three point six eight anymore. I'm gonna have a force of friction that I have to subtract. So minus mu K so the force of friction--- I'll just put force of friction. And so to solve for the force of friction, the force of friction is gonna be equal to--- Well, I know three times nine point eight is--- Let me just write this in here, 29.4 Newtons minus the force of friction it's given by. So there's a formula for force of friction. The force of friction is always mu K FN. So the force of friction on this five kilogram mass is gonna be mu K which is point three. So it's gonna be zero point three times the normal force, not the normal force on our entire system. I don't include this three kilogram mass. It's only the normal force on this five kilogram mass that's contributing to this force of friction here. So even though we're treating this system as a whole, we still have to find individual forces on this individual boxes correctly. So it won't be the entire mass that goes here. The normal force on the five kilogram mass is just gonna be five kilograms times nine point eight meters per second squared. I divide by my total mass down here because the entire mass is resisting motion through inertia. And if I solve this from my acceleration of the system, I get one point eight four meters per seconds squared. So this is less, less than our three point six eight and that makes sense. Now, there's a resistive force, a resistive external force, tryna prevent the system from moving. But you have to be careful. What I'm really finding here, I'm really finding the magnitude of the acceleration. This is just giving me the magnitude. If I'm playing this game where positive forces are ones that make it go and negative forces are ones that resist motion, external forces that is, I'm just getting the magnitude of the acceleration. 1Individual boxes will have that magnitude 1of the acceleration 1but they may have positive or negative accelerations. 1In other words, 1this five kilogram mass accelerating to the right, 1gonna have a positive acceleration. 1In other words, the acceleration of the five kilogram mass 1will be positive one point eight four 1and the acceleration of the three kilogram mass 1since it's accelerating downward 1will be negative one point eight four 1meters per seconds squared.",science_physics_forces-newtons-laws
" Let's explore another mechanism that we can have with the ketone. And actually, an aldehyde can undergo a very similar or actually the same type of reaction. So let's say that I had a ketone that looked like this. Let me draw my carbonyl group, just like that, and then it is bonded to a carbon that is bonded to two other CH3 groups. And just to make it clear, there's three hydrogens off of this carbon there implicitly. But I'm going to draw the fourth bond here, which is to a hydrogen, because this hydrogen is going to be important for this reaction. Now, we know that the oxygen has two lone pairs of electrons. Let me draw it up here. And let's just imagine it's floating around in some water, and we know that in water there is some concentration of hydronium. And let's say that one of the hydroniums is right over here. Hydronium is just positively charged, so this is right here. Let me do it in a different color. This is what water looks like. And if water gives away an electron to a proton, it looks like this. It is hydronium, and then it only has one lone pair of electrons. It gave away one of the other electrons in its other lone pair to a proton. So you can imagine a reality, where it's like, hey, I could grab that proton from this hydronium, and then this will turn back into water, and in that situation, the mechanism would look like this. Let me do it in a different color. This blue electron gets given to this proton, if they just bump into each other just right, and then the hydrogen's electron gets taken back by what will become a water molecule. So if that happens, what do our molecules now look like? So now, what was a ketone looks a little bit different than a ketone. It looks like this. I changed it to a slightly lighter color of green, so it looks like that. We have our lone pair over here, but we no longer have this lone pair. At this end, we still have this magenta electron, but now it is in a covalent bond with the blue electron, which was now given to the hydrogen proton. Let me scroll up a little bit. It was given to this hydrogen proton up here. And then this hydronium molecule, it took back an electron, and now it is just neutral water. It took back that magenta electron, so now it has two lone pairs again, so it is just neutral water. Since this oxygen up here in the carbonyl group gave away an electron, it now has a positive charge. But this is actually resoce stabilized. You could maybe see that this would be in resoce, or another resoce form of this would be-- if this guy's positive, so he wants to gain an electron, so maybe he takes an electron from this carbon, the carbon in the carbonyl group right over there. So if you takes that electron, then the other resoce form would look like this. Let me doing it in the same colors. You have now only a single bond with this oxygen up here. This carbon down here is still bonded to the same carbons, and then this carbon over here, we could call this an alpha carbon. This is an alpha carbon to the carbonyl group. It still has a hydrogen on it right over there. And this oxygen, since it gained this magenta electron, now it has two lone pairs. It has this pair over there, and then it gained this electron and this electron, so it has another lone pair. And, of course, it has the bond to the hydrogen. Since it gained an electron, it is now neutral. This carbon lost an electron, so now it is positive. So now this carbon right over here is positive, and these two are two different resoce forms, so they help stabilize each other. And the reality is actually someplace in between. I could actually draw it in brackets to show that these are two resoce structures. Now, you can imagine, just as likely-- and actually, I shouldn't just draw this as a one-way arrow, because this guy could take a hydrogen from this hydronium, or a water could take a hydrogen from this guy, so this actually could go in both directions. So let me make that clear. This could go in both directions. You could say that they're in equilibrium with each other. You're just as likely to go in that direction as you really, for the most part, are to go on the other direction. But you can now imagine, this has now turned from a carbonyl group, this has now an OH group, this has now turned into an alcohol, although we have this carbocation here, that this does not like being positive. And so you could imagine where this electron right here on this hydrogen nucleus might want to go really bad to this carbocation, and it just needs something to nab the proton off for it to go there. And the perfect candidate for that would just be a water molecule. We have this water floating around, so let me draw another water molecule, just like this. It has two lone pairs. It can act as a weak base. It can give one of its electrons to this hydrogen proton. If it does that at the exact same time, bumps into it in the exact same way, this electron can then go to the carbocation. And if that happened, you could go in either direction. This reaction is just as likely to happen as the reverse reaction, so we could put this in equilibrium. But if that were to happen, then what started off as our ketone now looks like this. We have a bond to an OH group just like this, and over here-- actually, let me draw the rest of it. We had our molecule that looked like that, but now, this electron gets giving back to this carbocation. We now have a double bond here between what was a carbonyl carbon and our alpha carbon. So now we have this double bond right over here. That hydrogen has been taken by the water, and now that is hydronium. So let me draw the water or the hydronium. So that water, it had that one lone pair, and then the other lone pair got broken up, because it gave one of the electrons to this hydrogen right over here, and it went back to being hydronium. So what happened here? We started with a ketone, and they sometimes will call this the keto form of the molecule, and then we ended up with something called the enol form. An enol comes from the fact that it is an alkene that is also an alcohol. You could even call it an alkenol. It has a double bond, and on one of the carbons that has a double bond, it has an OH group. And the whole reason I show you this mechanism is, one, just to show you a mechanism that could happen with an aldehyde or a ketone. This was a ketone, but if this was a hydrogen right here, this would have been occurring with an aldehyde. But even more, this is a pretty common mechanism that you'll see in organic chemistry classes, and actually has a lot of functions in biology, in general. And these two molecules, this ketone and this enol form, these are called tautomers. And the keto form is actually the much more stable form. In a solution, you won't see much of the enol form, but these can occur. It can spontaneously through equilibrium get to the actual enol form. And so you could imagine, these are tautomers, so this mechanism is actually called a tautomerization, and these are the keto and enol forms of the tautomers.",science_organic-chemistry_ochem-alpha-carbon-chemistry
" -  There's a lot of different ways that you could represent a linear equation. So for example, if you had the linear equation y is equal to 2x plus three, that's one way to represent it, but I could represent this in an infinite number of ways. I could, let's see, I could subtract 2x from both sides, I could write this as negative 2x plus y is equal to three. I could manipulate it in ways where I get it to, and I'm gonna do it right now, but this is another way of writing that same thing. y minus five is equal to two times x minus one. You could actually simplify this and you could get either this equation here or that equation up on top. These are all equivalent, you can get from one to the other with logical algebraic operations. So there's an infinite number of ways to represent a given linear equation, but I what I wanna focus on in this video is this representation in particular, because this one is a very useful representation of a linear equation and we'll see in future videos, this one and this one can also be useful, depending on what you are looking for, but we're gonna focus on this one, and this one right over here is often called slope-intercept form. Slope-intercept form. And hopefully in a few minutes, it will be obvious why it called slop-intercept form. And before I explain that to you, let's just try to graph this thing. I'm gonna try to graph it, I'm just gonna plot some points here, so x comma y, and I'm gonna pick some x values where it's easy to calculate the y values. So maybe the easiest is if x is equal to zero. If x is equal to zero, then two times zero is zero, that term goes away, and you're only left with this term right over here, y is equal to three. Y is equal to three. And so if we were to plot this. Actually let me start plotting it, so that is my y axis, and let me do the x axis, so that can be my x, oh that's not as straight as I would like it. So that looks pretty good, alright. That is my x axis and let me mark off some hash marks here, so this is x equals one, x equals two, x equals three, this is y equals one, y equals two, y equals three, and obviously I could keep going and keep going, this would be y is equal to negative one, this would be x is equal to negative one, negative two, negative three, so on and so forth. So this point right over here, zero comma three, this is x is zero, y is three. Well, the point that represents when x is equal to zero and y equals three, this is, we're right on the y axis. If they have a line going through it and this line contains this point, this is going to be the y- intercept. So one way to think about it, the reason why this is called slope-intercept form is it's very easy to calculate the y-intercept. The y-intercept here is going to happen when it's written in this form, it's going to happen when x is equal to zero and y is equal to three, it's gonna be this point right over here. So it's very easy to figure out the intercept, the y-intercept from this form. Now you might be saying, well it says slope-intercept form, it must also be easy to figure out the slope from this form. And if you made that conclusion, you would be correct! And we're about to see that in a few seconds. So let's plot some more points here and I'm just gonna keep increasing x by one. So if you increase x by one, so we could write that our delta x, our change in x, delta Greek letter, this triangle is a Greek letter, delta, represents change in. Change in x here is one. We just increased x by one, what's gonna be our corresponding change in y? What's going to be our change in y? So let's see, when x is equal to one, we have two times one, plus three is going to be five. So our change in y is going to be two. Let's do that again. Let's increase our x by one. Change in x is equal to one. So then if we're gonna increase by one, we're gonna go from x equals one to x equals two. Well what's our corresponding change in y? Well when x is equal to two, two times two is four, plus three is seven. Well our change in y, our change in y is equal to two. Went from five- when x went from one to two, y went from five to seven. So for every one that we increase x, y is increasing by two. So for this linear equation, our change in y over change in x is always going to be, our change in y is two when our change in x is one, or it's equal to two, or we could say that our slope is equal to two. Well let's just graph this to make sure that we understand this. So when x equals one, y is equal to five. And actually we're gonna have to graph five up here. So when x is equal to one, y is equal to, and actually this is a little bit higher, this, let me clean this up a little bit. So this one would be, erase that a little bit. Just like that. So that's y is equal to four, and this is y is equal to five. So when x is one, y is equal to five, so it's that point right over there. So our line is going to look- you only need two points to define a line, our line is going to like, let me do this in this color right over here. Our line is going to look like, is going to look, is going to look something like, is going to look, let me see if I can, I didn't draw it completely at scale, but it's going to look something like this. This is the line, this is the line, y is equal to 2x plus three. But we already figured out that its slope is equal to two, when our change in x is one, when our change in x is one, our change in y is two. If our change in x was negative one, if our change in x was negative one, our change in y is negative two. And you can see that, if from zero we went, we went down one, if we went to negative one, then what's our y going to be? Two times negative one is negative two plus three is one. So we see that, the point negative one comma one is on the line as well. So the slope here, our change in y over change in x, if we're going from between any two points on this line, is always going to be two. But where do you see two in this original equation? Well you see the two right over here. And when you write something in slop-intercept form, where you explicitly solve for y, y is equal to some constant times x to the first power plus some other constant, the second one is going to be your intercept, your y-intercept, or it's going to be a way to figure out the y-intercept, the intercept itself is this point, the point at which the line intercepts the y axis, and then this two is going to represent your slope. And that makes sense because every time you increase x by one, you're gonna multiply that by two, so you're gonna increase y by two. So this is just a, kinda of a get your feet wet with the idea of slope-intercept form, but you'll see, at least for me, this is the easiest form for me to think about what the graph of something looks like, because if you were given another, if you were given another linear equation, let's say y is equal to negative x, negative x plus two. Well immediately you say, okay look, my yintercept is going to be the point zero comma two, so I'm gonna intersect the y axis right at that point, and then I have a slope of, the coefficient here is really just negative one, so I have a slope of negative one. So as we increase x by one, we're gonna decrease y by one. Increase x by one, you're gonna decrease y by one. If you increase x by two, you're gonna decrease y by two. And so our line is gonna look something like this. Let me see if I can draw it relatively neatly. It's going to look something, I think I can do a little bit better than that. It's 'cus my graph paper is hand drawn. It's not ideal, but I think you get, you get the point. It's gonna look something like that. So from slope-intercept form, very easy to figure out what the y-intercept is, and very easy to figure out the slope. The slope here, slope here is negative one. That's this negative one right over here, and the y-intercept, y-intercept is the point zero comma two, very easy to figure out 'cus essentially that gave you the information right there.",math_algebra-home_alg-linear-eq-func
" - If we have a rectangle with base length b and height length h, we know how to figure out its area. Its area is just going to be the base, is going to be the base times the height. The base times the height. This is just a review of the area of a rectangle. Just multiply the base times the height. Now let's look at a parallelogram. And in this parallelogram, our base still has length b. And we still have a height h. So when we talk about the height, we're not talking about the length of these sides that at least the way I've drawn them, move diagonally. We're talking about if you go from this side up here, and you were to go straight down. If you were to go at a 90 degree angle. If you were to go perpendicularly straight down, you get to this side, that's going to be, that's going to be our height. So in a situation like this when you have a parallelogram, you know its base and its height, what do we think its area is going to be? So at first it might seem well this isn't as obvious as if we're dealing with a rectangle. But we can do a little visualization that I think will help. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a chunk of area from the left-hand side, actually this triangle on the left-hand side that helps make up the parallelogram, and then move it to the right, and then we will see something somewhat amazing. So I'm going to take this, I'm going to take this little chunk right there, Actually let me do it a little bit better. So I'm going to take that chunk right there. And let me cut, and paste it. So it's still the same parallelogram, but I'm just going to move this section of area. Remember we're just thinking about how much space is inside of the parallelogram and I'm going to take this area right over here and I'm going to move it to the right-hand side. And what just happened? What just happened? Let me see if I can move it a little bit better. What just happened when I did that? Well notice it now looks just like my previous rectangle. That just by taking some of the area, by taking some of the area from the left and moving it to the right, I have reconstructed this rectangle so they actually have the same area. The area of this parallelogram, or well it used to be this parallelogram, before I moved that triangle from the left to the right, is also going to be the base times the height. So the area here is also the area here, is also base times height. I just took this chunk of area that was over there, and I moved it to the right. So the area of a parallelogram, let me make this looking more like a parallelogram again. The area of a parallelogram is just going to be, if you have the base and the height, it's just going to be the base times the height. So the area for both of these, the area for both of these, are just base times height.",math_cc-sixth-grade-math_cc-6th-geometry-topic
" In the last video, we figured out the formulas for the observed period and frequency for an observer sitting in the path of the source. So the source is moving towards the observer. So this is the example where the train is moving towards you, and you perceive the train's horn as having a higher pitch or a higher frequency. And we were able to do that by doing a thought experiment. Saying, OK, my object starts here. After one period-- a period is just a measure of time, but it's the measure of time over which the source emits a cycle, so it emits a cycle every period. But after one period, we said, OK, where is that first wave front, or that first pulse, or that first crest? And where is the source? Because exactly one period has passed by, and the source will be ready to emit another crest or another cycle. So the distance between where the source is and that front of the crest, or that first crest, that is going to be the wavelength. Because this next thing that emits is going to be traveling at the exact same velocity, and it's going to be separated by that distance, which we saw is this expression. We said how long will it take it to travel that distance? Well, it's traveling at a speed of v sub w. That'll tell you what the observed period would be for this dude over here. We calculated it right here, and then the observed frequency is just the inverse of that. Now let's think about the situation where the observer is over here. So these equations, or these formulas that we came up with right here, this is observer-- or let me say source traveling in direction of observer. Now let's think about the opposite case, where the source is traveling away from the observer, and in this case, the observer is that guy over there. Maybe I'll do it in a different color. He'll be blue. So this is the observer. So when we started off, our source was right here. After exactly one period from the source's point of view, that first crest emitted has traveled radially outward that far. This is the distance. The velocity of the wave times the amount of time that passed-- velocity times time is going to give you distance-- and where the source of the wave will have traveled to the right exactly this distance. It's velocity times the amount of time that's gone by. Now, in the last video, we said, OK, that wave is just passing this guy. How long will it take for that pulse that's being emitted right then to also reach him? And then that tells us the period between two pulses or between two crests. Now let's think about that exact same situation here. That first crest is just passing this guy. And a period, or the t sub s, which is a period of the emitted wave has just passed by. So this guy is just about to emit another wave, So? That other wave is going to be right here. So what is the distance between the crest, or the cycle, or however you want to think about it, the pulse that is passing him by right now, what is the distance between that and the pulse, the front edge of that pulse that is being emitted right at that moment? Right at that moment. Well, it's going to be this radius, which is this value. It'll be v sub w times the period. That is that distance plus the amount of distance that our source has traveled away from this guy. So plus v sub s times the period. So that's what this distance is, and this is how far apart this wave pulse is going to be from that one or this crest is going to be from that one. So if he's seeing this first crest right now, right at this moment, how long will it take him to see the crest that's being emitted right now, that's this far away from him? Well, it's that far away from him. So let me write this down. So the amount of time it takes for him to see the next crest or the same point in the next cycle, that's the period. That's the observed period. That's going to be equal to this distance. The velocity of the wave times the period from the perspective of the source plus the velocity of the source, because the source has gotten that much further away from him, velocity of the source times the period of the source, so that's how far the next crest is. And then you divide it by the speed of the wave, by the speed of each of the crests, which is just the velocity of the wave. And we can just factor out the t sub s's here and say this is t sub s times v sub w, the velocity of the wave plus the velocity of the source divided by the velocity the wave. So this will be a larger observed period than if this guy was stationary and especially if the observer was in the path of the guy. That make sense, because every time this guy issues a cycle, he is moving a little bit further away. So every crest the same point in the cycle is going to be further and further apart, so you're going to have longer wavelengths, longer periods. And if you want the observed frequency for that guy over there-- I'll do it in the same color. The observed frequency for a guy where the source is traveling away from him is just the inverse of that. So one over the period, one over the period, same argument we did there, one over the period from the point of view of the source is the frequency of the source. Let me Color code it. So 1 over t sub s is equal to the frequency of the source. This is the inverse of that. So I'm just taking one over everything here. So 1 over t sub s is the frequency of the source, and then we take the inverse of this over here: the velocity of the wave divided by the velocity of the wave plus the velocity of the source. So we're done, at least for the simple cases. Obviously, it becomes a little more interesting when someone isn't exactly in the direction of the source or exactly being moved away from, but these are kind of the two extreme cases. So this is the situation when it is moving away from you. Now, just to check our math and maybe make it a little bit concrete in relation to the video we did where we introduced to the idea of the Doppler effect, let's actually apply those numbers. So on that video, two videos ago, we had a situation where the velocity of our source was 5 meters per second to the right, and the velocity of the wave was 10 meters per second radially outward, and the period of our wave-- I'll call it the period of our-- let me do it in another color-- from the point of view of the source was 1 second per cycle, and the frequency was just the inverse of that. So 1 cycle per second, or 1 Hertz, which is a cycle per second. So using those numbers, let's see if we get to the exact same answer we got in that first video where we first learned about the Doppler effect. So let's look at the frequency from the point of view of this gentleman right here. So the frequency of the source is going to be 1 cycle per second, 1 Hertz. The velocity of the wave is 10 meters per second. Let me write this. 1 cycle per second. The velocity of the wave is 10 meters per second. The velocity of the wave is 10 meters per second minus the velocity of the source is 5 meters per second. So what's this going to be equal to? The observed frequency for this guy right there, is going to be 1 cycle per second times 10 over 10 minus 5, and the meters per second cancel out. Meters per second in the numerator, meters per second in the denominator. So 10 divided by 10 minus 5, or 10 divided by 5, is going to be 2. So it's going to be 2 cycles per second. And if you want the observed period for this guy, its going to be the inverse of that, or it's going to be 1/2 second per cycle. And this is exactly what we got in the previous video, or actually, it was two videos ago. Now what about the guy who this guy's running away from? Well, we'll do the exact same thing. You have 1 cycle per second, or 1 Hertz. That's the emitted frequency from the point of view of the source times the velocity of the wave divided by the velocity of the wave plus the velocity of the source, because it's moving away from him. So it's 10 over 10 plus 5. That's 10 over 15. That is 2/3, so this is equal to 2/3. The units over here all cancel out. This was cycles per second. So 2/3 cycle per second, which confirms the numbers we got in that first video, so that should make us feel good and it also makes a lot of sense. This guy is going to see the wave crest more frequently. He's going to observe a higher frequency. If this is a sound, a higher pitch. This guy, since each crest or the cycles are getting spread out, he's going to see them less frequently, and if this is sound, he's going to observe a lower pitch.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-11th-physics-waves
" - So, let's set up a relationship between the variables x and y. So, let's say, so this is x and this is y, and when x is one, y is four, and when x is two, y is eight, and when x is three, y is 12. Now, you might immediately recognize that this is a proportional relationship. And remember, in order for it to be a proportional relationship, the ratio between the two variables is always constant. So, for example, if I look at y over x here, we see that y over x, here it's four over one, which is just four. Eight over two is just four. Eight halves is the same thing as four. 12 over three it's the same thing as four. Y over x is always equal to four. In fact, I can make another column here. I can make another column here where I have y over x, here it's four over one, which is equal to four. Here it's eight over two, which is equal to four. Here it's 12 over three, which is equal to four. And so, you can actually use this information, the ratio, the ratio between y and x is this constant four, to express the relationship between y and x as an equation. In fact, in some ways this is, or in a lot of ways, this is already an equation, but I can make it a little bit clearer, if I multiply both sides by x. If I multiply both sides by x, if I multiply both sides by x, I am left with, well, x divided by x, you'd just have y on the left hand side. Y is equal to 4x and you see that's the case. X is one, four times that is four. X is two, four times that is eight. So, here you go, we're multiplying by four. We are multiplying by four, we are multiplying by four. And so, four, in this case, four, in this case, in this situation, this is our constant of proportionality. Constant, constant, sometimes people will say proportionality constant. Constant of proportionality, portionality. Now sometimes, it might even be described as a rate of change and you're like well, Sal, how is this a, how would four be a rate of change? And, to make that a little bit clearer, let me actually do another example, but this time, I'll actually put some units there. So let's say that, let's say that I have, let's say that x-- Let me do this, I already used yellow, let me use blue. So let's x, let's say that's a measure of time and y is a measure of distance. Or, let me put it this way, x is time in terms of seconds. Let me write it this way. So, x, x is going to be in seconds and then, y is going to be in meters. So, this is meters, the units, and this right over here is seconds. So, after one second, we have traveled, oh, I don't know, seven meters. After two seconds, we've traveled 14 meters. After three seconds, we've traveled 21 meters, and you can verify that this is a proportional relationship. The ratio between y and x is always seven. Seven over one, 14 over two, 21 over three. But, I wanna write that in terms of it's units. So, y over x is going to be, if we look at this point right over here, it's seven meters over one second. Seven meters over one second, or it's equal to seven meters per second. If you look at it right over here, if you say y over x, it's 14 meters, 14 meters, in two seconds, in two seconds. Well, 14 over two is seven, 14 over two is seven, and then the units are meters per second. So, that's why this constant, this seven, in all of these cases we have y over x is equal to seven, that this is also sometimes considered a rate. And over here it's very clear, this is my distance per time. Now, if I wanted to write it generally, I could say that, look, if I'm dealing with a proportional relationship, it's going to be of the form, I can always construct and equation of the form, of the form, either y over x is equal to k, where k is some constant. In this first example, k was equal to four and in this second example, k is equal to seven. Or, you can just manipulate it algebraically, multiply both sides by x and you would have y is equal to, y is equal to kx, where once again k is our constant of proportionality or proportionality constant. So, this is a really, in some ways it's a very simple idea, but in a lot of ways, you'll see this showing up multiple, many, many times in your mathematical career and it's neat to be able to recognize this as a proportional relationship.",math_8th-grade-foundations-engageny_8th-m4-engage-ny-foundations
" So how do we know that there is a core, and that the core is made up of a liquid outer core and a solid inner core? And the answer there comes from the same technique that we saw Mohorovicic use in 1909 to essentially see the behavior, or when you measure the seismic waves, or whether you can even measure the seismic waves, the different distances from an earthquake. So if there's an earthquake right here. We're calling that zero degrees. Let's remember a couple of things here. Let's remember that P-waves can travel through anything. They can travel through solid or liquid or air for that matter. So they can travel through anything. But S-waves, S for secondary, these are the transverse waves, these can only travel through solids. So it turns out that if an earthquake happens at zero degrees, and you had seismograph stations all over the world, and these are extremely sensitive in order to be able to measure earthquakes that are happening thousands of kilometers away, it turns out that there's something called an S shadow, an S-wave shadow. If these are S-waves you can measure them here. You can measure them here. They can go all the way over here. They can go over here. They can go over there. You can measure them over here. So you could measure them at all of these points, but then all of a sudden at 105 degrees, and so we're measuring zero degrees here and we're going outwards like that, all of a sudden at 105 degrees and further you stop measuring S-waves. For some reason you would think that some of the S-waves would get over here, maybe they would be a little bit weaker, but they would be able to get all the way over here. But they just abruptly stop. No more S-waves. So in this whole area right over here you get no S-waves. And obviously I could flip this picture over and you would see a symmetric thing on the other side of the globe that all of this area over here you also would not see S-waves. You'd only see them from 105 degrees in this direction and 105 degrees in that direction. And the only reasonable explanation that we can give is that there must be some material that an S-wave cannot travel through that it would have to travel through to get to these points beyond 105 degrees. And we know that S-waves only travel in solids. So the assumption there is that at some point beyond 105 degrees it's hitting liquid. So that's what tells us that this right here is probably a liquid. It's hitting some layer that is liquid. So that tells us that there's a core, and at least the outer part of that core is liquid, enough to stop S-waves. So the S-waves, because it only travels in solids it leads to this S-wave shadow. And this tells us that we have a core. And that core, at least the outer part, is liquid. We don't know yet whether the inner part is liquid or solid. Now, the next point of evidence is how do we know that there's an inner core? And we can use P-waves for that. A P-wave can travel through anything, but remember, in general for the same type of material if you get denser material it's going to move faster, so it's going to refract outwards like we've seen over here. But if it goes into a liquid, in general, sound waves, or I should say P-waves, seismic waves move slower in liquids. And so the refraction patterns we get when we do measure from seismograph stations around the world is that it looks like the P-waves are kind of doing what you would expect in the mantle, but then they're getting refracted as if they're going to a slower medium as they go through the outer core. And we see that right over here. And then they get refracted again to get to some point on the other side. Now, that is just what you would expect if it was all liquid, but if you go to stations that are even further out it looks like, if you just look at the refraction patterns, and you can now model this with fancy computers and get all the data points, but you could say, well, the only way that reality can fit the data that we get based on when things reach here is if the P-waves are being first refracted through the outer core, but then they're refracted in a way that they're going through denser material, significantly denser material than the inner core. And then they're just continuing to refract the way you would expect. So it's really the refraction pattern of the P-waves. And frankly, the fact that there's this what you call a P-wave shadow. The P-wave shadow by itself, all that tells you is that kind of roughly crazy things are happening someplace in the core. But the real way to know that we have an inner core that's solid, as opposed to the whole thing being liquid, is that the P-waves is the pattern of when and how the P-waves reach essentially the other side of the globe. And then you can kind of, based on modeling how waves would travel through different densities and different types of mediums, you could say, well, there's got to be an inner core right over here. And obviously, it's a lot more math than I'm going into. But if you do the math based on the shadow, and you know the speed of the material, and all of that type of thing, then you can figure out the depth at which these transitions occur. We know that we have a transition from mantle to outer core here. And then a transition from outer core to core there. So hopefully that satiates your questions about how do we know what the composition of the earth is without ever having to dig down there, because we've never even gotten below our crust.",science_cosmology-and-astronomy_earth-history-topic
" -  Let K equal six, so that F of X is equal to one over X-squared minus six X. Find the partial fraction decomposition for the function F. Find the integral of F of X D-X. And so let's first thinl about the partial fraction decomposition for the function F. So, F of X, I could rewrite it where I factor the denominator. If I factor out an X, I get X times X minus six. So, I can rewrite this as... And this is where I'm going to decompose it into partial fractions. A over X plus B over X minus six. If I actually had to add these two, I would try to find a common denominator. The best common denominator is just to take the product of these two expressions. So I could multiply the numerator and denomenator of this first time by X minus six. X minus six. And the numerator and denominator of the second term, I can multiply it by the denominator of the other one. So times X and times X. So that would give us, let's see if I distribute the A, it would give us A X minus six A plus B X over X times X minus six. If this looks completely foreign to you, I encourage you to watch the videos on Kahn Academy on partial fraction decomposition. So let's see if we can, so what we wanna do is solve for the A's and the B's. And so let's see, if we see that these have to add up to one over X times X minus six. So these have to add up. I'm just going back to this, these have to add up. The numerator. So it has to add up to one over X times X minus six. So this numerator has to add up to one. So what we can see is is that the X terms right over here must cancel out since we have no X terms here. We have A X plus B X must be equal to zero. Or you could say, well that means A plus B is equal to zero. So we took care of that term and that term. And then we know, that this must be the constant term that adds up to one or that is equal to one. And so we also know that negative six A is equal to one. Or A is equal to, divide both sides by negative six, negative one sixth. And if A is negative one sixth, well B is going to be the negative of that. And negative one sixth plus B. I'm just substituting A back into that equation. Need to be equal to zero. And so add one sixth to both sides, you get B is equal to one sixth. So I can decompose F of X. I can decompose F of X as being equal to A over X So that's negative one sixth over X. I just write it that way. I could write it as negative one over six X or something like that. But I'll just write it like this, just be clear that this was our A. Plus B, which is one sixth over X minus six. So that right over there, that's the partial fraction decomposition for our function F. And if I want to evaluate the integral. So the integral of F of X, the indefinite integral. Well, that's where this partial fractions decomposition is going to be valuable. That's going to be the indefinite integral of negative one sixth over X plus positive one sixth over X minus six, and then we have D X. Well what's the anti-derivative of this right over here? Well the anti-derivative of one over X is the natural log of the absolute value of X. And so we can just this is going to be negative one sixth times the natural log of the absolute value of X. Anti-derivative of this part. Then plus one sixth. You could do u-substitution but you could just say ""Hey, look the derivative of this bottom part, X minus six."" That's just one. So you could say that I have that derivative laying around. So I can just take the anti-derivative with respect to that. So that's going to be one sixth times the natural log of the absolute value of X minus six, and then I have plus C. Don't forget this is an indefinite integral over here. And then you're done. And you see that partial fraction decomposition was actually quite useful. So they were helping us how to figure out this. You didn't just have to have that insight that, okay how do I evaluate this anti-derivative. Well, the they're telling us to use partial fraction decomposition.",math_calculus-all-old_ap-calc-topic
" -  In this picture we've got a pregt mom and a little fetus inside of her uterus. That's the name of this little chamber that the fetus is hanging out in. This uterus is an organ and women have this organ. It's a very, very strong organ, very muscular organ. In fact, if you've ever gone to a delivery and you've heard people chant, ""Push, push, push,"" they're literally kind of encouraging mom to push down on this uterus and help the baby come out into the world. So this uterus is the room in which the baby lives. But the environment in which the baby lives is actually very different as well from how we live outside, in the sense that there's amniotic fluid in this space, right, and the baby is actually swimming in this fluid, for months at a time. For nine months, baby is swimming in amniotic fluid and that brings up some obvious questions. How is baby able to breathe or eat? How does it take care of its needs? Let's think about what those needs are. Let's enumerate them. One of them is oxygen. How does a baby take in oxygen if it's not getting it from the lungs? The lungs are actually full of amniotic fluid, by the way. How is it able to get nutrients? Things like sugar, glucose, that it needs for energy. I'll put example, glucose. Let's think about waste. How does it get rid of things like carbon dioxide? For us, it's very easy, we just kind of exhale or take a breath out. But how does a baby do that if I just said that the lungs are full of fluid? How does it get rid of waste products like carbon dioxide? It turns out all of these kind of issues are obviously very important, and the mom and the baby work together a solution. This is the first chance for mom and baby to really work together on something. The solution is something called the placenta. You may have heard of the placenta. The baby actually sends a couple of vessels up to the placenta. These are little umbilical arteries. It also sends up an umbilical vein to the placenta. The vein brings blood back from the placenta. In all these vessels, all three of these, make what we call the umbilical cord. You may have heard of the umbilical cord and now you know what's inside of it. The umbilical cord actually, if you were to cut it, I'm gonna show you what it would look like if you were to cut across it. It's actually an easy thing to remember because it has a big, floppy little vessel right here. That's the umbilical vein. It's got oxygen, that's why I'm drawing it as red even though it's a vein because it's coming back to the heart, that's why we call it a vein. And you've got umbilical arteries. These two actually don't have too much oxygen. That's why I'm drawing them in blue, just to show that they're low in oxygen. They're called umbilical arteries because they're going away from the heart. The umbilical arteries and the umbilical vein look like this, actually they're kind of they're not just freely floating out there. They're actually encased in this jelly, and the jelly is called Wharton's jelly. I'm actually just gonna redraw this, just to show you how I remember this. Sometimes it' hard to remember if there's one artery or two arteries. I think of the mouth as a vein, or a V. And I think of the eyes as two little A's. That's my little trick for remembering that there are two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein, and that they're all encased in the Wharton's jelly, and this is the umbilical cord. This is the overall picture, now I wanna go into some detail to really get us to understand how the placenta works because it honestly is one of the most interesting organs in the sense that it allows us to do things that we simply cannot do today, but we could do for many, many months at a time. I'm gonna invert the way that I drew this. I drew this one way above and I think you'll see how I flipped it around here. This'll be the uterine wall. Again, remember the uterine wall is a nice, strong, muscular wall. Let me label it so it's clear. This is uterine, I'll just call it uterus, the wall of the uterus anyway. On the insides you've got, actually I'm working from the outside in. Let me draw some of mom's blood vessels. She's got some blood vessels coming up like this, this is a little uterine artery. This, of course, gives oxygen to the uterus. We said it's a big muscle so it definitely needs blood vessels, like arteries and veins. I'll draw a couple of them. I'll draw another uterine artery over here, and I'll draw one third one over here. Of course, they are many more than three but I just wanna give you the concept that there are some uterine arteries. There are also some uterine veins. Let me draw some uterine veins as well. I'll draw one over here. These blue ones are the uterine veins, I'll label this one over here. What they're doing is they're actually going through a layer of tissue. Let me draw in a layer of tissue for you so you see exactly what I mean. There's a layer of tissue here, they're going through it. This layer of tissue is mom's tissue. I'm gonna label it mom's tissue, or I'll just call it mom's. It looks a little bit, you have to stretch your imagination, but it looks a little bit like a plate. This entire thing that I'm shading in in red is one of the parts of the placenta. So we've already started drawing the placenta. Actually, let me switch colors. This part is known as the basel plate. If you're talking about the basel plate you're talking about this bit of tissue here, with the blood vessels, the uterine arteries, and the uterine veins. Just to be clear, it belongs to mom. This is mom's cells. Now we get into some really fun stuff. All these uterine arteries, they squirt out blood. They don't go into any other vessel. They just squirt out blood into an open area. Let's say there's a red blood cell here, this red blood cell literally could touch, physically touch a red blood cell over here. They literally could come up, and meet, and maybe shake hands. They could then go down the veins. This is really, really different from how we usually think about blood cells traveling always within a vessel. Cuz here it's kind of a pool. You have this circulation that happens because you have these red blood cells, as I've drawn them, kind of going up, into the middle, then circulating into the veins. You have this interesting circulation where you basically have blood coming up through the arteries and down into the veins. The way I think about this, and you can maybe choose your own kind of analogy. But for me, I think of it a little bit like a hot tub. The uterine arteries are like the jets of water, coming up. The uterine veins are literally like the drains in the hot tub. It becomes almost like a swirling pool of red blood cells. Importantly, these red blood cells have with them oxygen, they have nutrients, so they have a lot of the stuff that our fetus is interested in getting access to. Let's switch gears, let's think about our fetus. Our fetus has got, we said a couple of umbilical arteries coming down. I also said that they're coming down inside of this Wharton's jelly, this umbilical cord of Wharton's jelly. Actually what happens is that the vessels actually branch out and they split up. The uterine arteries, form lots and lots and lots of little branches. I'm gonna draw them in for you. Let's say that the branches go all over the place. They go like this. Let's draw five or six branches over here. Let's draw some branches down on this side too. We've got lots of branches off the uterine arteries. They want access to the oxygen and nutrients. Guess what they do? They just kind of push in, in fact, you have little cells here. I'm gonna draw some pushing in right here. You got little cells that I'm drawing in white, called trophoblast. They literally do this. They just kind of push in. These white cells are trophoblast cells. They're good at invading. You could think of them as invading or if you wanna be less aggressive, you could think of them as being just curious. These little fetus cells, called trophoblasts, start pushing in. And within the trophoblast is a little blood vessel. This blood vessel now is in very close contact with mom's red blood cells, you've got red blood cells coming up alongside of it. Now what's gonna happen through diffusion, is that oxygen is gonna go into the fetus' blood cells. So oxygen is going this way, as well as nutrients. Oxygen, nutrients go inside, then you have carbon dioxide leaving. So carbon dioxide actually goes into the pool of blood. It's a really, really cool thing that the red blood cells aren't touching, 1the mom's red blood cells 1are not touching baby's red blood cells 1cuz, of course, baby's red blood cells 1are within blood vessels, 1these are within blood vessels. 1These things right here are not open, 1they're closed vessels. 1Once that exchange happens, 1they continue to stay closed, 1and you get a little capillary coming back. 1You've got capillaries coming back 1from every part of this. 1All of these have been doing the same thing. 1Going inside of this pool of blood. 1It actually gets a little bit more complicated 1than the way I've drawn it, in fact, 1a more accurate drawing might be with more branching. 1You might have something like this, 1where it really has lots of surface area. 1It comes back around, 1and you have the blue vessels 1going into each one 1of these finger-like projections. 1You have a lot of gas exchange happening. 1This would be maybe a better way of drawing it 1but the concept is the same. 1You basically have all this 1wonderful diffusion happening. 1As a result you actually have 1nice, rich oxygenated blood 1returning to the baby. 1This is finally allowing the baby to have access 1to oxygen and nutrients 1and get rid of its waste, its carbon dioxide. 1Each one of these is actually doing the same thing 1with red or oxygenated blood coming back. 1Instead of having two vessels, 1it all dumps into one vessel down the middle. 1This vessel, as we already know, 1is called the umbilical vein. 1This is actually the umbilical vein. 1If we call the bottom one the basel plate, 1then, of course, you're guessing that 1there must be some name for this. 1This, of course, has its name 1called the chorionic plate. 1This one, you can already tell, 1this has all the cells from the fetus, 1so this belongs to the fetus. 1You've got some tissue that belongs to the fetus, 1that would be the chorionic plate and all of its contents. 1You've got some tissue that belongs to mom, 1that's the basel plate. 1Then you've got some 1shared tissue, or space, in here. 1All these little projections belong to the baby. 1But the actual pool, 1this pool of blood that's circulating. 1That pool of blood belongs to mom. 1So really, the placenta is a combination 1of all of these things. 1I think of the placenta then 1as the first time that mom and baby 1work together for a common purpose.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" -  ""Fleur wants to make tables and chairs. ""Each chair or table is made with the same number ""of wooden boards and nails. ""She has a total of 150 wooden boards and 330 nails. ""The following inequality represents the number ""of tables, T, and chairs, C, ""she can make with 150 wooden boards."" So we can see the 150 wooden boards right over here and it looks like she uses 17 wooden boards for each table so the total amount of boards from the tables are to make the tables is 17 T. And it looks like she uses six wooden boards for each chair and that's why you take six per chair times the number of chairs. This is the total number of wooden boards she uses from the chairs. And you add them together. It can't be anymore than 150. She only has, I guess 150 wooden boards. ""Additionally, the following inequality represents ""the number of tables and chairs ""she can make with 330 nails."" So once again, she has the maximum of 330 nails. It looks like she needs 34 nails per table because the total nails from the tables is 34 nails per table times the number of tables. And then it looks like she needs 27 nails. It looks like she needs 27 nails per chair because the total nails that she uses in all of the chairs are 27 nails per chair times the number of chairs. ""Does Fleur have enough boards ""and nails to make three tables, ""to make three, ""to make three tables and nine chairs? ""And nine chairs?"" Let's see, let's look at the number of boards. To make three tables and nine chairs, she's going to use 17 times T. In this case, it's three. Shes' going to use 17 times three boards for the tables and then she is going to use, she is going to use six times the number of chairs. So six times nine chairs. Six boards per chair times nine chairs. So six times nine is the number of boards she's going to use on the chairs. So this is going to, this is the same thing as 17 times three is 51. 51 plus, six times nine is 54. So this is 54. And what is this? Is this less than or equal to 150? Is that less than or equal to 150? Let's see, 51 plus 54 is going to be 105. So that indeed is less than or equal to 150. So that checks out. So she has more than enough boards. So she has enough boards. Let me write that. Enough boards. Now let's see if she has enough nails. Let's see if she has, that came out weird, enough boards. Let's see if she has enough nails. So three tables are going to require 34 times three nails. So 34 nails per table times three tables. So 34 times three. That's how many nails for all of the tables. And then plus, if she is going to use 27 nails per chair times the nine chairs. 27 times nine. We need to figure out, is this less than or equal to 330? And so let's see. 34 times three, that is 100. No, that's 90 plus 12. So that's 102 and then 27 times nine. So let's see, that would be, was it 243? Yep, so plus 243. So it's 102 plus 243, is that less than or equal to 330? So let's see, this would be, this would end up adding up to 345. No, this is not less than or equal to 330. This is not the case. This is not true. Not true. So she does not have enough nails. So not enough, not enough nails. And so she has enough boards but not enough nails. So unless she goes and buys some nails, she's not going to be able to make these tables and chairs.",math_algebra_inequalities-systems-graphs
" Let's do a slightly more complicated two-dimensional projectile motion problem now. So in this situation, I am going to launch the projectile off of a platform. And then it is going to land on another platform. And I'm going to fire the projectile at an angle. Let me draw this a little bit better. So I'm going to fire the projectile at an angle of-- let me use a not so clean number. Let's say it is a 53-degree angle. And it's coming out of the cannon. And let me make it clear. So it's coming out-- let me do it this way, just to make it 100% clear. So this angle right over here is 53 degrees. And we are going to have it come out of the muzzle of the cannon with a velocity of 90 meters per second. And just to give ourselves a sense of the heights, or how high it's being launched from-- so from the muzzle of the cannon down to here. So this height right over here, let's say that that is 25 meters. And let's say that this height right over here is 9 meters. And so we're essentially launching this from a height of 25 meters. I know in the last video, even though I drew the cannon like this, we assumed that it was being launched from an altitude of 0 and then landing back at an altitude of 0. Here we're assuming we're launching it from an altitude of 25 meters, because that's when it's leaving the muzzle. And it's going to start decelerating at least in the vertical direction as soon as it leaves the muzzle. And then we're assuming it's not going to land back at the same altitude. It's going to land at a different altitude. So how do we think about this problem? So the first thing you'll always want to do is divide your velocity vector into its horizontal and vertical components. You use the vertical component to figure out how long it's going to stay in the air. And then you use the horizontal component to figure out, given how long it's in the air, how far did it travel. And once again, we're going to assume that air resistance is negligible. So just based on what we did in the last video-- and I'll go through all of the steps in this one, as well. So if we draw our vector, the length here is going to be 90. This is our velocity vector. The angle over here between the x-axis and our vector is 53 degrees. And let me draw the horizontal component. The horizontal component would look like this. And the vertical component-- I'll do it in orange. The vertical component would look like-- that's not orange. The vertical component will look like this. And so the vertical component of the vector-- what would be the length of this side right over here? Well, this is the opposite side. We know from basic trigonometry sine of an angle is opposite over the hypotenuse. So we know that the sine of 53 degrees is equal to this opposite side, is equal to the vertical velocity. And I could write it's the magnitude of the vertical velocity. I write that subscript y, because we're in the y direction. That's the vertical direction, over the length of the hypotenuse, over the magnitude of our original vector. Or we can get that this side right over here. If we multiply both sides by 90, we get that the magnitude of that side is going to be equal to 90 times the sine of 53 degrees. Now, if we want to do the horizontal component, the horizontal side is adjacent to this. Cosine, soh cah toa. Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. So the horizontal component of our velocity, I'll say in the x direction, over the hypotenuse, over 90, is equal to the cosine of 53 degrees. Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. Adjacent, that's this length, over 90. Multiply both sides by 90. You get that the horizontal component is equal to 90 times cosine of 53 degrees. Now, how do we figure out how long this thing stays in the air? Well, we'll use the vertical component for that. And especially since we're dealing with different levels, we can't use that more basic reasoning, that hey, whatever velocity we start off at, it's going to be the same velocity but in the opposite direction. Or the same magnitude and velocity but the opposite direction. Because we're not going to the same elevation. But what we could do is we can use the formula that we derived in the previous video. That the displacement-- let me just copy and paste this a little bit lower so we can use it. So I'll stick it right over here. So we could use this. We know that the displacement is equal to the initial velocity-- and we're dealing with the vertical direction right here-- times the change in time plus the acceleration, times the change in time squared, divided by 2. So how do we use this to figure out how long were in the air? So what is the displacement? If we're starting at 25 meters high, and we're going to 9 meters high. So over the course, while this thing is traveling, it will be displaced downwards 16 meters. Or another way to think about it is our displacement in the vertical direction is going to be equal to negative 16 meters. Let me write that a little bit bigger. Negative 16 meters, right? Because 25 minus 9 is 16. And so we can put that into the formula that we derived in the previous video. We get negative 16-- I won't write the units here just so that we don't take up too much real estate, so that at least it looks simple-- is equal to the initial velocity. We're dealing with just the vertical dimension here. So we're just dealing with the vertical. And remember, it's negative because our displacement is going to be downwards. We're losing altitude. So our vertical velocity-- we already figured that out. It is 90 times the sine of 53 degrees. Actually, let me do it in that same color. The first time we do a new type of problem, it's good to know-- so 90 times the sine of 53 degrees, times our change in time, is equal to the acceleration of-- due to the force of gravity for an object in free fall is going to be negative 9.8 meters per second squared. But we're dividing that by 2. So we're going to have minus 4.9 meters per second squared times delta t squared. Times our change in time squared. So how do we solve something like this? You can't just factor out a t and solve it. But you might recognize this is a quadratic equation right over here. And the way you solve quadratic equations is you get everything onto one side of this equation. And then you either factor it out. But more likely in this situation, we will use the quadratic formula, which we've proved in other videos and hopefully given you the intuition for it-- to actually solve for the times where your elevation, where your displacement in the vertical direction is negative 16 meters. And you'll get two solutions here. And one of the solutions will be a negative change in time. So it'll be like at sometime in the past, you were also at negative 16 meters. That's nonsensical for this problem. So we'll want to take the positive value here. So let's put all of this on one side of the equation. So let's add 16 to both sides. On the left-hand side, you just get a 0. 0 is equal to-- and I'll write it in kind of the traditional way that we're used to seeing it. I'll write the highest degree term first. So negative 4.9 times delta t squared. And then we have plus 90 sine of 53 degrees times delta t, and then plus 16. I'm going to do that in yellow. All of this is equal to 0. And this, once again, is just a quadratic equation. We can find its roots. And the roots will be in terms of delta t. We can solve for delta t using the quadratic formula. So we get delta t-- and if this is very unfamiliar to you, review the videos on Khan Academy in the algebra playlist on the quadratic formula. And if you don't know where it came from, we also prove it for you. So it's equal to negative B. B is this term right here, 1the coefficient on the delta t. 1So it's going to be negative 90 sine of 53 degrees. 1I'll write the quadratic formula up here 1for those of you who don't fully remember it. 1So if I'm trying to solve Ax squared plus Bx 1plus C is equal to 0, the roots over here 1are going to be negative B plus or minus the square root of B 1squared minus 4AC, all of that over 2 times A. 1These are going to be the x values that 1satisfy this equation up here. 1So that's all I'm doing over here. 1This is the B value. 1Negative B plus or minus-- and it's 1going to turn out that we only care about the plus one, 1because that's going to give us the positive value. 1But I'll just write it out here. 1Plus or minus the square root of B squared. 1So it's this quantity squared. 1So it is 90 sine of 53 degrees squared, minus 4-- 1we're going to run [? out that ?] little space. 1So minus 4 times A, which is negative 4.9. 1Well, let me just write negative 4.9 times C. C over here 1is 16, times 16. 1Let me put this radical all the way over here. 1All of that over 2A. 1So A is negative 4.9. 12 times A is negative 9.8. 1So now we can get the calculator out 1to figure out our change in time. 1And I'm just going to focus on the positive version of it. 1I'll leave it up to you to find the negative version 1and see that it'll give you a negative value for change 1in time. 1And that's nonsensical, so we only 1care about the positive change in time 1where we get to a displacement of negative 16 meters. 1Let's get the calculator out. 1So we get-- want to do this carefully. 1We have negative 90 sine of 53 degrees plus. 1I'm doing the plus version here because that'll give us 1the positive value-- plus the square root of. 1And I'll do this in parentheses. 190 sine of 53 degrees squared. 1That's that part right there. 1These two negatives cancel out. 1So I could say this is plus 4 times positive 4.9. 1So plus 4 times 4.9 times 16. 1And then that closes off our entire radical. 1And so this will give me the numerator up here. 1That gives me the numerator. 1And then I want to divide that by-- did I do the negative 90? 1Oh, and I just realized that I made a mistake. 1I said that the positive version would give you 1the positive time. 1But now we realize that's wrong. 1Because when I took the positive version, when I put a plus up 1here, I get a positive 2.14 for the numerator. 1But then we divide it by negative 9.8. 1We're going to get a negative value. 1So that's not going to be the time that we care about. 1We care about the time where this is a negative value. 1So let me re-enter that. 1So let me do the negative value. 1So let me move back a little bit. 1And then let me replace this with a minus sign. 1So I'm going to look at the negative value, 1because I want the positive time. 1And so now my numerator here is a negative value. 1And so this is actually what we care about. 1We care about the numerator's a negative value. 1You divide by negative 9.8, and you 1get 14.8-- I'll just round-- 14.89 seconds. 1So delta t, the positive version, 1is equal to 14.89 seconds. 1And so my initial comment about using the positive version 1was wrong because we have this denominator that's negative. 1So you want the numerator to be negative. 1And only when the numerator is negative 1will the whole expression be positive. 1And so we got this positive time of 14.89 seconds. 1I'm going to leave you there. 1And the next part of the video-- actually, I 1might as well just solve it instead of making a new video. 1Although this is running long. 1So the amount of time that we're in the air is 14.89 seconds. 1So if I were to ask you the horizontal displacement, 1it's going to be the amount of time 1we're in the air times your constant horizontal velocity. 1And we already figured out our constant horizontal velocity. 1So if you want to figure out how far along the x-axis 1we get displaced, we just take this time 1times-- that just means our previous answer-- 1times this value right here, times 90 cosine of 53 degrees. 1And that gives 806 meters. 1So this displacement right over here is 806 meters.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-class11th-physics-motion-in-a-plane
" -  The distribution of average wait times in drive-through restaurant lines in one town was approximately normal with mean of 185 seconds and standard deviation of 11 seconds. Amelia only likes to use the drive-through for restaurants where the average wait time is in the bottom 10% for that town. What is the maximum average wait time for restaurants where Amelia likes to use the drive-through? Round to the nearest whole second. Like always, if you feel like you can tackle this, pause this video and try to do so. I'm assuming you've paused it. Now let's work through this together. So let's think about what's going on. They're telling us that the distribution of average wait times is approximately normal, so let's get a visualization of a normal distribution. And they tell us several things about this normal distribution. They tell us that the mean is 185 seconds, so that's 185 there, the standard deviation is 11 seconds. So, for example, this is gonna be 11 more than the mean, so this would be 196 seconds, this would be another 11. Each of these dotted lines are one standard deviation more. So this would be 207. This would be 11 seconds less than the mean, so this would be 174, and so on and so forth. And we want to find the maximum average wait time for restaurants where Amelia likes to use the drive-through. Well, what are those restaurants? That's where the average wait time is in the bottom 10% for that town. So how do we think about it? Well, there's going to be some value, let me mark it off right over here in this red color, so we're going to have some threshold value right over here where this is anything that level or lower is going to be in the bottom 10%. Or another way to think about it is, this is the largest wait time for which you are still in the bottom 10%. And so this area right over here is going to be 10% of the total, or it's going to be 0.10. So the way we can tackle this is we can get up a z-table and figure out what z-score gives us a proportion of only 0.10 being less than that z-score, and then using that z-score, we can figure out this value, the actual wait time. So let's get our z-table out, and since we know that this is below the mean, the mean would be the 50th percentile, we know we're gonna have a negative z-score. So I'm gonna take out the part of the table that has the negative z-scores on it. And remember, we're looking for 10%, but we don't want to go beyond 10%. We want to be sure that that value is within the 10th percentile, that any higher will be out of the 10th percentile. So let's see, when we have theses really negative z's, so far it only gets, it only doesn't even get to the first percentile yet. So let's scroll down a little bit and let's remember as we do so that this is zero in the hundreds place, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, so let's remember those columns. So let's see, if we are at a z-score of negative 1.28, remember this is the hundreds is zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, so this right over here is a z-score of negative 1.28 and that's a little bit crossing the 10th percentile. But if we get a little bit more negative than that, we are in the 10th percentile. So this is negative 1.29, and this does seem to be the highest z-score for which we are within the 10th percentile. So negative 1.29 is our z-score. So this is z equals negative 1.29, and if we want to figure out the actual value for that, we would start with the mean, which is 185, and then we would say, ""Well, we want to go 1.29 standard deviations ""below the mean."" The negative says we're going below the mean. So we could say minus 1.29 times the standard deviation and they tell us up here the standard deviation is 11 seconds. So it's going to be 1.29 times 11. And this is going to be equal to 1.29 times 11 is equal to 14.19. And then I'll make that negative, and then add that to 185. Plus 185 is equal to 170.81. 170.81. Now they say round to the nearest whole second. There's a couple of ways to think about it. If you really want to ensure that you're not gonna cross that 10th percentile, you might want to round to the nearest second that is below this threshold. So you might say that this is approximately 170 seconds. If you were to just round normally this would go to 171, but just by doing that, you might have crossed the threshold. But in all likelihood for this application where someone is concerned about wait time at drive-through restaurants, that difference in a second between 170 and 171 is not going to be mission critical, so to speak. But you could safely say that 170 or 171 seconds will meet Amelia's needs.",math_statistics-probability_modeling-distributions-of-data
" In the last video, we figured out how to figured out the sum of the roots of a polynomial. What we're going to try to attempt to do in this video is think about the sum of the squares of the roots of a polynomial. So let's think about that a little bit. So let's say that I have a second degree polynomial that looks like this. So it's x squared plus a1x, plus a2 and this is equal to 0. We saw-- and actually, I'll just redo some of what we did in the last video, because it's going to be useful over here. This thing is going to have two roots, r1 and r2. Two roots, and that tells us that this thing can be rewritten as x minus r1, times x minus r2 is equal to 0. And if you expand this out, you get x squared minus r1 plus r2, x, plus r1r2. So that's what you get right over there. Now, let's think about it. We figured out from the last video that r1 plus r2, which is right over here, that needs to be equal to the negative of this coefficient. This a1 over here is equal to the negative of r1 plus r2. So r1 plus r2 is equal to the negative of a1. So let's see if we can use that information, right over there, to figure out what-- let me do this in a new color-- to figure out what r1 squared plus r2 squared is. So let's see how we could get that. Well, one place that we could start off with, we could start off with r1 plus r2 squared. So r1 plus r2 squared, which is, of course, the same thing as negative a1 squared, which would be the same thing as a1 squared. a1 squared-- I could put a negative here, but a negative 1 times negative 1 is obviously a positive one-- this is going to be equal to r1 squared plus 2r1r2, plus r2 squared. So this has the sum that we care about in it. Let's call this sum 1-- we're just raising the roots to the first power. Let's call this sum 2. So this over here, we've written, essentially, that sum 1 squared-- that's sum s sub 1 squared is equal to-- this plus this is s sub 2-- is equal to s sub 2 plus 2r1r2. Now, can we figure out what r1r2 is based on looking at the actual original polynomial? Well, you look over here, if you just did an expansion-- of course, I forgot to write here that this is equal to 0-- r1r2 is essentially represented by a2 over here. So to take the first degree sum, or the roots raised to the first power sum, we looked at this coefficient. Now all of a sudden, we're involving the coefficient to the right of that. We're going two degrees below the degree of the polynomial. So this, right over here, is a2. So r1r2 is a2. That's a2. This right here-- this whole expression-- is a1 squared. So if we want to solve for this sum-- if we want to solve for s sub 2, we would get s sub 2 is equal to a1 squared-- that's this over here-- minus 2 times a sub 2. So we just figured out a fast way to figure out the sum of the squares of the root of just a second degree quadratic right now. So for example, if I were to give you-- let me give you something strange. So if I were to give you 7x squared minus pi x, plus e is equal to 0. And someone said, I want you to figure out the sum of the squares of the roots of this polynomial, first you want to make the coefficient in front of the x squared 1. So divide everything by 7. So you get x squared minus pi over 7 x, plus e over 7 is equal to 0. And then you could just use the result that we just found. The sum of the square of the roots-- is this s2 over here. Whatever the roots are, you square each of them, you take their sum, and it's going to be equal to a1 squared. So it's going to be pi squared over 49. I'm just squaring this right over here, or I could just square that. The negative doesn't matter what I'm squaring. minus 2 times e over seven. And that's about as simplified as you could get this expression. So it's pi squared over 49, minus 2 e over 7, which by itself a pretty neat result. Because it would be very hard to find the roots of this. You'd get some crazy numbers, and then you'd have to square them and sum them. But we just figured out a very fast way of doing it. Now, let's see if we can extend this to the third degree. And it actually turns out you can-- not only to the third degree you can extend this to the nth degree. And I might do an induction proof it gets a little bit messier than when you just take the first degree sum, right over here, where you take the sum of the roots to the first power. But let's just see if it works for the third power. So let's say, I have the polynomial x to third plus a1x squared, plus a2x, plus a3 is equal to 0. We have three roots. r1, r2, r3, which tells us that we can rewrite this polynomial as x minus-- or this equation as x minus r1, times x minus r2, times x minus r3 is equal to 0. Now we already figured out what this part right here is, it's this thing over here. We already multiplied it out. It's this thing. It is this over here. So essentially, to get this whole expression, we just have to multiply this times this thing over here. We can just use the distributive property-- multiple this thing times each of these terms. So first, let's multiply this whole thing by x. So you get x to the third, minus r1 plus r2 times x squared, plus r1r2x. So I just multiplied this thing over here times x. Now I can just multiply this thing up here times negative r3. So negative r3 times x squared. Negative r3 times this term over here, it will give us-- well it's going to be a negative times a negative, so it's going to be a positive-- so it's positive r3 three times this. We can distribute them. We're going to get r1-- so let me make sure I'm doing. Negative r3 times this over here is going to be negative-- let me just write it like this. I don't want to skip steps. So it's going to be-- the negative and the negatives cancel out. So negative r3 times r1 plus r2 x. And then finally, you have the negative r3 times r1r2. So minus r1r2r3. And all of that's going to be equal to 0. But let's simplify it. So this thing is going to be equal to x to the third minus r1 plus r2 plus r3-- we did that in the last video. That shows us that the sum of our roots is this second coefficient here, the coefficient on the second degree term, x squared. And then, we go over here. We have r1r2, x. Then you have r1, r3 x. Plus r1r3-- I'm just distributing this. And then you have r3 times r2. So plus r2r3. All of that times x, and then minus r1r2 and r3. Now if we want to take the sum of the squares of the roots. So if we want to take r1 squared plus r2 squared plus r3 squared, well, we could try to do the same thing. We could take r1 plus r2 plus r3, which we know how to calculate-- we can square that. And we're essentially going to get-- When you square this you're going to get-- let me see if I can write it neatly. This is going to be equal to r1 times-- So I'm just going to-- let me just rewrite it. This is equal to-- just to clarify, this is equal to r1 plus r2 plus r3, times r1 plus r2 plus r3. So it's going to be-- I could start over here. r1 times r1 is r1 squared, plus r1 times r2-- so r1r2-- plus r1 times r3. And then, plus-- now we're in the r2. r2 times r1 is plus r1r2-- same thing, I'm just switching the order so it looks the same. r2 times r2 is r2 squared. And then, r2 times r3 is plus r2r3. And then let's go to the r3, r3 times r1 is just another r3r1-- I just switched the order. r3 times r2 is another r2r3. And then, r3 times r3 is r3 squared. So what did we just get here when we squared just the straight up sum? You got r1 squared plus r2 squared plus r3 squared, 1plus-- you essentially got all of the different combinations, 1but you got them twice. 1You have two r1r2, so you have 2 times r1r2. 1Then you have two r1r3, so plus r1r3-- I have the 2 out front. 1Plus r2r3. 1And this over here is equal to-- remember 1what we did-- this is equal to r1 plus r2 plus r3 squared. 1So we got essentially the same result. 1Remember, this thing right over here-- let's make things clear. 1This thing over here r1-- all the combinations 1of the products of the roots. 1If you look over here, that's exactly what 1this thing is over here, which must 1be what our a2 coefficient is. 1So this is our a2 coefficient. 1This r1 plus r2 plus r3, that is-- we 1figured out multiple times-- that's 1this thing right over here, which is going to be a1. 1So this is going to be a negative, 1or it's equal to negative a1. 1But you take negative a1 squared, 1and that's the same thing as a1 squared. 1So this is a1 squared. 1And this is the sum that we care about. 1So we get r1 squared plus r2 squared plus r3 squared 1is equal to this business over here. 1It's equal to a1 squared minus 2 times a2. 1So we got the exact same result that we 1got for the second degree case. 1And it actually turns out this will be true of any degree. 1I haven't proven to you yet, although I 1can make an induction argument now-- 1we've proven some base cases. 1But just to make it clear how to apply it, 1I give you crazy polynomial. 1I give you-- Let's do a third degree case, 1let's say, 10x to the third minus 5 x 1squared, plus 7x-- I'm making this up on the fly-- plus 2 1is equal to 0. 1And if I were to ask you the sum? 1If I were to ask you r1 squared plus r2 squared plus r3 1squared-- If I were to ask you the square of the sum 1of the roots, you just take-- well, let me be careful. 1You have to make sure that you have 1a one in front of the highest degree term. 1So this thing over here, has to be rewritten. 1Divide both sides by 10 x to the third minus 5 over 10, 1so minus 1/2 x squared, plus 7 over 10 1x, plus 2 over 10, which is one fifth is equal to 0. 1So I just divided both sides by 10, 1and yup, I did that part right. 1And now, we can apply this. 1I almost made a careless mistake. 1You have to have a one coefficient out here, at least, 1the way that we've derived this. 1So this sum is going to be equal to a1 squared. 1So it's this-- 1/2 squared. 1So a1 is actually negative 1/2, but negative 1/2 half 1squared is just one fourth. 1So it is going to be one fourth minus 2, times a2. 1So minus 2 times 7 over 10. 1So this is equal to one fourth minus 14 over 10. 1We could find a common denominator here. 1This is the same thing as 5 over 20 minus 14 over 10. 1And this is equal-- or sorry, minus 28 over 20, I should do, 1which is equal to negative 23 over 20. 1And you might say, hey, Sal, hang on. 1I'm taking the square of a bunch of roots and adding them up, 1and I'm getting a negative number. 1I thought squares-- I thought y squared numbers I always 1get a positive number that would be true if you're dealing 1with real numbers, but remember the words of a polynomial 1can be complex and complex numbers 1squared can be negative numbers. 1So this obviously is involving some type of complex roots. 1But we know that the sum when you 1take the sum of the squares of those complex roots you 1get negative 23 over 22.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_aime
" Let's play the angle game. So I've drawn this crazy figure here and I'm going to give you a couple of angles and then I want you to figure out another angle. So let me give you some angles. So let's say that this angle up here is 56 degrees. Then I also tell you this angle here is 115 degrees. What I would like you to figure out -- this is the object of the angle game -- I want you to figure out what this angle is right here. If you are brave, you can pause the video and try to figure it out yourself. If you would like me to walk you through it -- and maybe I can give you a couple of steps and then you pause it and you get the rest of it by yourself. But I will now show you how I would have solved this in the angle game. You have all the tools necessary to already solve it. I want you to be able to get good at this, because this is kind of like the key skill on the SAT. Oh, I didn't give you a key piece of -- you're probably saying I can't solve this. You probably can't because I haven't given you a key piece of information. This line here and this line here, so this line and this line, they're parallel. I was telling you to solve it before giving you a key piece of information. That means that they are parallel. So what can we do this figure? So whenever I see these type of problems, either while playing the angle game or on, say, an SAT, I just literally kind of figure out every angle that I can figure out and slowly try to make my way to the goal angle. Let's see what we can figure out here. So I'm going to do it in this blue-green color anything that I can figure out. So this angle is 56 degrees, right? These lines are parallel. This line here looks like a transversal. Well, let's see, what's a corresponding angle to this angle right here? Well, it's the angle, right? What do we know about corresponding angles for parallel lines when you have a transversal. Well, that's 56 degrees because corresponding angles are equal. We could have done a lot of other stuff. We could have figured out that this angle is 56 degrees, but that probably wouldn't have gotten us closer to our goal. That angle's 56 degrees and its corresponding angle is also 56 degrees. That wouldn't have gotten us any closer to our goal. We could have figured out that this is 180 minus 56, right, which is, what, 124 degrees. That really wouldn't have helped us much. I'm showing you, these are all things that you can do while playing the angle game. But anyway, the first step -- I said well, these are corresponding angles, so that's 56 degrees. So let's see, I need to figure out this angle right here. I know this one, and they're in a triangle, right? You see this triangle. If only I knew this angle. Can you figure out this angle? Well, it is supplementary to this 115 degrees, right? So this green angle plus this purple angle is equal to 180. So this is 180 minus 115. So what's that? 180 minus -- so this is 65 degrees. So what have we done so far? We just said well these are parallel lines, so corresponding angles are equal. So this 56 degrees is equal to this 56 degrees. Then we said, well, this green angle and this purple angle are supplementary, so they have to add up to 180. So this is 115. But this is 65, which is just 180 minus 115. I think you might see where I'm going now. Now we know two angles of a triangle. If we know two angles of a triangle, what can figure out about the third? Well, we know the angles of a triangle add up to 180, right? So let's called this x. We know that x plus 56 plus 65 equals 180. What's 56 plus 65? This is where I always mess up, on the addition and the subtraction. So, 5 plus 6 is 110. This is 121 I believe. 121 equals 180. Then x is equal to -- let's see, 180 minus 20 is 60, so it's 59. x is equal to 59 degrees. There we go. We have accomplished our first goal in the angle game. There you saw it. So let's do a tougher angle problem. This one maybe won't involve parallel lines. But I just want to show you, everything really just boils down to everything we learned about parallel lines and triangles and angles adding up to each other. So this one involves a star. So, a line from there to there, draw a line from there to there, draw a line from there to there, draw a line from there to there. Draw a line from there to there. What do we know about this? We know that this angle is 75 -- oh boy, I'm using the wrong tool. This angle is 75 degrees. We also know that this angle is 75 degrees. We know this angle here is 101 degrees. Your mission in this angle game is to figure out this angle right here. What is this angle? This is a good time to pause because I will now show you the solution. So what can we do here? So this angle, well jeez, I just like to just mess around and see what I can figure out. So, if this angle here is 101 degrees, what other angles can we figure out? We could figure out -- well, we could figure out this angle. We could figure out a bunch of angles. We could figure out that -- let me switch the color, these are my figure out angles. So that's 101, then this is supplementary, that's 79 degrees, right? That's also 79 degrees because this is also supplementary. This angle right here is opposite to it, so this angle right here is going to be 101 degrees. What else can figure out? We could figure out this angle because it's supplementary, we could figure out this angle. We could also figure out this angle because we see this triangle right here. This angle plus 75 plus 75 is going to equal 180, right? So let's call this angle b, b for blue. So b plus 75 plus 75 is going to equal 180. And I'm just using this triangle right here. So b plus 150 is equal to 180, or b is equal to 30 degrees. So we're able to figure this out. Now, what will you do if I told you that we are now ready to figure out this yellow angle? It might not be obvious to you. You kind of have to look at the triangle in the right way, and the SAT will do this to you all the time, all the time. That's why I'm testing you this way. Well, let me give you a little hint. Look at this triangle. Non-ideal color, let me do it in red so it really stands out. Look at this triangle. I'll tell you, the hardest thing about these problems is just looking at the right triangle and kind of seeing that oh wow, I actually can figure out something. Look at this triangle right here. We know this angle of it, 101 degrees. We know this angle, we just figured it out, it was 30 degrees. So all we have left is to figure out this yellow angle, call it x. So x plus 101 plus 30 is equal to 180 degrees because the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So x plus 131 is equal to 180. x is equal to what? 49 degrees. There you go. We've done the second problem in the angle game. I think that's all of the time I have now in this video. In the next video maybe I'll do a couple more of these angle game problems. See you soon.",math_geometry-home_geometry-angles
" -  ""Many species have circadian rhythms ""that exhibit an approximately 24-hour cycle. ""Circadian rhythms are controlled by both genetics ""and environmental conditions, including light. ""Researchers investigated the effect of light ""on mouse behavior by using a running wheel ""with a motion sensor to record activity ""on actograms, as shown in figure one."" All right, so let's think about what figure one is showing us. We have a picture of a mouse here that seems to be inactive, definitely not on the running wheel, even eyes closed, maybe it's sleeping. And then here, a picture of a mouse that is on the running wheel, maybe running, with its eyes open. And then we see our actogram here and it describes, ""Strategy for recording mouse activity data. ""When a mouse is active on the running wheel, ""the activity is recorded as a dark horizontal line ""on an actogram. ""When the mouse is inactive, ""no dark line is recorded."" So we can see here, it gives us the activity for each day. So for day one, day one is right over here. Let me do that in a lighter color so that I don't overwrite what you need to see. So day one is right over there, and you can see from hour zero to hour 12, since we have no black line, the mouse is inactive. We're not detecting activity on the running wheel. And then when we have the black line from hour 12 to hour 24, that means we are detecting activity on the running wheel and so we can assume that the mouse is active. And then we have it again for day two, and the way this is set up, it looks like that pattern holds for every day. Let's keep going. ""For the investigation, ""adult male mice were individually housed in cages ""in a soundproof room at 25 degrees Celsius."" So they wanted to make sure that these mice didn't bother each other, that this was definitely controlled conditions. Soundproof, that they're not impacted by outside noises, other mice, a variation in temperature, so they tried to for all of these things. ""Each mouse was provided with adequate food, ""water, bedding material, and a running wheel. ""The mice were exposed to daily periods ""of 12 hours of light,"" with the capital L, ""and 12 hours of dark,"" capital D. L12, D12. So that's 12 hours of light, 12 hours of darkness, ""for 14 days, and their activity ""was continuously monitored. ""The activity data are shown in figure two."" All right, so this is an actogram of mouse activity under L12, D12 conditions. Each row represents a 24-hour period and the dark horizontal lines represent activity on the running wheel, just like we saw before. But this is actual data that we are recording. So in the first 12 hours, the mouse are in conditions where there's light, and you can see for the most part, on day one, we detect no activity. On day two, we also detective no activity. On day three, we detect a little bit of activity, but for the most part, when it's light, we detect very little to no activity. And when it's dark, it's the opposite. We detect a lot of activity on that running wheel. There's a few gaps right over here, but for the most part, the mouse is active when it's dark. So the mouse is active when it's dark and inactive when it is light, which is the opposite of most human beings, or frankly, well, definitely human beings, where we tend to be active in the light and inactive in the dark. Interesting. After 14 days, so that was just with 12 hours of light, 12 hours of darkness. ""After 14 days of L12, D12,"" so it's 12 hours of light, 12 hours darkness, ""the mice were placed in continuous darkness."" Capital D, capital D. DD, that sounds unpleasant. Continuous darkness. And their activity on the running wheel was reported as before. ""The activity data under DD,"" continuous darkness, ""conditions are shown in figure three."" All right, so this is interesting here. So it looks like on day one, the mice were inactive, not 12 hours, like we saw when we had 12 hours of light, but it looks like about 10 hours. And then from hour, I don't know, this is maybe hour nine or 10, to about hour, it looks like maybe hour 21, they were active. Maybe 12 hours, maybe a little less than 12 hours. And then inactive, active, inactive, active, but it seems to be less than for 12 hours. And then they're active for less than 12 hours. So you see everything shifting up every 24-hour period because they tend to be inactive for less than 12 hours. It looks like it's 10 or 11 hours each day. And then active for a little bit less than 12 hours. So that's why you see this shifting pattern where every day the activity starts at roughly an earlier period. It's not a perfect trend, but you see the trend over multiple days. I can draw, I can show a line that goes something like this. You can see every day we are starting activity at an earlier hour. And every day we're also ending our activity at an earlier hour. And there's a lot more, I guess you could say, sporadic activity going on. And remember, this under continuous darkness. All right, let's see if we can answer the questions. ""The nervous system plays a role in coordinating ""the observed activity pattern of mice ""in response to light-dark stimuli."" Yes, that makes sense, of course. ""Describe one role of each ""of the following anatomical structures ""in responding to light-dark stimuli."" A photoreceptor in the retina of an eye. Well, this detects light. Detects light and sends signal. Or maybe I'll say transmit signal. Transmits signal that eventually gets to brain. That eventually gets to brain. Gets to the brain. All right? The brain. Well, it receives signals. It receives. I before E, except after C. It re-see (laughs), it receives, it receives signals. It receives signals and then coordinates activity based on that. Coordinates activity response based on that. Based on signals. Based on the signals. So this is really just, you know, do we know what a photoreceptor, a brain, and a motor neuron, I guess as related to this test. And then a motor neuron, well, these are neurons that would stimulate. You tend to think of things that would be, you know, like motor movement, like muscles, but they also control things like glands. So they stimulate muscles, glands. And glands could be especially relevant here because glands might be the things that release or don't release hormones that might put the mice to sleep or wake them up. Glands that might release hormones related to sleep. Might release hormones related to sleep, wake. Related to sleep and activity. All right, so I think that's, we've taken a decent job of describing the role of each of those. All right, let's go to part B now. ""Based on an analysis of the data in figure two, ""describe the activity pattern of mice ""during the light and dark periods ""of the L12, D12 cycle."" Well, this was pretty straightforward. When there was light, so they were inactive during light. Inactive during light. Active during dark. Active during dark. I could've written the answer down below, but I think I could've squeezed this one in. That's the basic idea. L12, D12 cycle, we saw right over here. Inactive during light, and then active during the dark. All right. Active during the dark. Okay. ""The researchers claim that the genetically controlled ""circadian rhythm in the mice does not follow ""a 24-hour cycle. ""Describe one difference between the daily pattern ""of activity under L12, D12 conditions, ""figure two, and under,"" continuous darkness, the DD conditions in figure three. And ""use data to support the researchers' claim."" All right, well, we talked about this already. So under DD, mice active and inactive for less than 24, or less than 12 hours each. 12 hours each. And then we could say versus 12 hours inactivity under light, under, I could say, L12. And 12 hours activity 1under D, 1under D12. 1So under continuous darkness, 1mice active and inactive for less than 12 hours each 1versus 12 hours inactivity under L12 1and to 12 hours activity under D12 1when it was dark for 12 hours. 1So less than 124-hour cycle. 1So less than 124-hour cycle. 1Activity also more sporadic. 1Activity 1also more 1sporadic. 1Sporadic, or we could say less continuous. 1Less continuous, there's definitely more times 1where the activity periods is broken up 1by inactivity or the inactive periods 1is broken up by activity. 1Less continuous. 1All right, I feel pretty good about that. 1Now, let's see. 1Actually, since I'm already at 11 minutes in this video, 1I'll continue the next two parts in the next video.",science_ap-biology_worked-examples-ap-biology
" -  Okay, so now now let's talk about the cellular structure of bone. You can think of bone as being mostly made up of the bone matrix and then the cells that actually help to form this bony matrix. Now the majority of bone is made up of the bone matrix, which consists of two principle building blocks. The first of which is called osteoid and this forms the organic portion of the matrix, and then you have something called hydroxyapatite which forms the inorganic portion of the bone matrix. So first lets talk about the organic portion of the bone matrix. The organic portion of the bone matrix is made up of, like I said, osteoid, which consists of a soft but highly ordered structure of proteins and then collagen, specifically Type I collagen. So together, the orientation of these highly organized collagen fibers along with the proteins helps to give bone it's tensile strength. So what does tensile strength really mean? If you think about a really hard piece of rubber, like a rubber eraser for example, I kind of think of tensile strength as being similar to the way that piece of rubber gives ever so slightly if you were to push on it but it still holds its shape. And so that's what you can think of as bone's tensile strength. Now for the inorganic portion of bone. The inorganic portion of bone is made up of hydroxyapatite. And I'll draw it's chemical formula here. It is calcium along with phosphate and water. So basically all hydroxyapatite is is calcium phosphate crystals. And these calcium phosphate crystals are the mineral portion of bone that gives bone it's rigid strength and density. So now you have a better understanding of the osteoid or organic portion of the bone matrix and hydroxyapatite which make up the inorganic portion of the bone matrix. So now lets talk about the cells that are actually responsible for making up this bony matrix. There are four different types of cells to be familiar with in bone. And the first group are the osteoprogenitor cells. Next we have what are called osteoblasts. Then there are the osteocytes, and finally we have the osteoclasts. And so you can see they all share the same root, osteo, meaning bone. So lets make a little bit more room here and talk about each of these cells one by one and what they do. So first up we have the osteoprogenitor cells. These cells are basically just the precursor to osteoblasts. So basically they're just an immature version of osteoblasts and they differentiate into osteoblasts under the influence of various growth factors. So that brings us up to osteoblasts. Now osteoblasts are the cells that are responsible for synthesizing both collagen and proteins, specifically a couple of proteins called osteocalcin and osteopontin, and together these make up osteoid. Osteoblasts are also responsible for producing alkaline phosphatase, which is the enzyme that is responsible for forming hydroxyapatite, or the mineral portion of bone. Once osteoblasts have synthesized enough collagen and proteins and alkaline phosphatase to form the organic and inorganic portion of the bony matrix around them and they're finally surrounded by all of this they mature into the osteocyte. So the mature version of an osteoblast once it's all done synthesizing the bony matrix, becomes an osteocyte. So that brings us to osteocytes. Now the spaces that osteocytes occupy within bone are called lacunae. And the term lacunae really just refers to an empty space within bone. So under a microscope, these spaces look, to me, like little lakes. And so that's how I remember what lacunae are, they are little lakes, or absences, empty spaces within bone. And these osteocytes have little arms or branches that reach out to communicate with other osteocytes or osteoblasts, which kind of gives them this star-like appearance. And these little branches are like sensors that pick up new information, send out signals, basically allowing osteocytes to communicate with other cells that help to maintain bone. And then the final cell type is the osteoclast. Now osteoclast are derived from a cell line called monocytes. And they are responsible for bone resorption. So basically they break bone back down again and they do this with an enzyme called tartrate resistant acid phosphatase. So osteoblasts help build up bone with an enzyme alkaline phosphatase, and then osteoclasts help to break that bone back down again with an enzyme tartrate resistant acid phosphatase. So bone is basically constantly being remodeled. Built up by osteoblasts and broken down again by osteoclasts. And an easy way to keep this straight is to think that osteoblasts, the b in blasts is for building bone and then osteoclast, the c in osteoclasts, is for crashing bone down. So osteoblasts build up bone, osteoclast break it back down again. Now as osteoclasts are resorbing bone, they start to form little empty spaces in bone. And wait, what are empty spaces in bone called? They're called lacunae. And so just like osteocytes occupy lacunae, osteoclasts occupy special kind of lacunae called Howship's lacunae, which are just the little resorption pits formed by osteoclasts as they break down the bone surrounding them.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" In this video we're going to do with the hyperbola the exact same thing we did with the circle. We're going to find constraints on the y-intercept for the tangent line in terms of m. But this time we're going to use the hyperbola. And then we can set them equal to each other, and solve for the m. So let's remind ourselves what the equation of the hyperbola is. They give it to us right over there. It's x squared over 9 minus y squared over 4 is equal to 1. Let me write this over here. So it is x squared over 9 minus y squared over 4 is equal to-- I'll write the y squared-- minus y squared over 4 is equal to 1. But now we can substitute the y squared with the y is equal to mx plus b that we got from the last video. And we actually figured out what y squared is equal to. Y squared is equal to all of this business up here. Because it's the same line. Remember, this is the whole point of it. We're trying to find two constraints on that same line. So we can rewrite this same thing. And actually one thing I want to do is I'm going to multiply both sides of this equation by 36, the common multiple of 9 and 4, so that I can get rid of these fractions. And so this is going to become 36-- let me write it this way-- so 36 divided by 9 is 4. So it's 4x squared minus-- 36 divided by 4 is 9-- and I would put a y squared here but we know that y squared is the exact same thing as this thing over here. So y squared is the same thing as m squared. x squared plus 2 mbx plus b squared. And then this is going to be equal to-- remember, we multiplied both sides of this equation by 36-- so this is going to be equal to 36. And let me simplify this. And we're going to do the exact same thing. We know that the m and b have to be such that, or the line has to have a slope and y-intercept where it'll only intersect with the hyperbola at one point. It'll only have one solution to this quadratic in terms of x. But let's simplify it first before we worry about that. So this is equal to 4 x squared minus 9 m squared x squared minus 18 mbx, minus 9 b squared. Just multiply it there. And let me subtract this 36 from both sides, so then we have minus 36 is equal to 0. So this is a quadratic in terms of x. But let me combine the various degree terms. So these are the x squared terms right over here. So this is the same thing as 4 minus 9 m squared times x squared. And then our only x term is this right over here. That's our only x term. So this is minus 18 mbx. And then our constant terms are right over here. So this over here is minus 9 b squared-- and let me write it this way, let me write it as minus 9-- well I'll just write it, minus 9 b squared minus 36. I'll just write it like that. And of course that is going to be equal to 0. And remember, quadratic formula, if we wanted to solve for the Xs, we'd have the quadratic formula, but we only want to have one solution. So the discrimit part of the quadratic formula is going to equal 0. The b squared minus 4 ac is going to be equal to 0. This is exactly what we did in the last video. So let's take the b squared minus 4ac and set that equal to 0, and then we'll have our constraints on m and b. So b squared is-- and remember don't get the squared in the quadratic formula confused with the b in the y-intercept. But this term squared is-- so this is going to be-- 18 squared m squared b squared, right? Negative 18 squared is just positive 18. Minus 4 times a. a is 4 minus 9 m squared times c. So I can rewrite c as negative 9 times b squared plus 4. Did I do that right? Negative 9 times b squared is negative 9 b squared. Negative 9 times 4 is negative 36. I want to make sure I don't make any careless mistakes. And so this becomes-- so if we just take the negative 9 and the negative 4-- they become a positive 36. They become a positive 36. And then we can actually, just to simplify things so we don't have to do too much fancy math, this 18 squared-- let's remember-- 18 squared is the same thing as-- well 18 squared is going to be divisible-- well I won't worry too much about that just yet. I just want to make sure that-- Actually let me write it this way. So 18 squared is 2 times 9 times 2 times 9. Or another way to think about it is 4 times 9 times 9. That's the same thing as 18 squared. 4 times 9 times 9. Now we can divide both of these terms-- and this whole thing, remember we want this whole thing to be equal to 0. The discrimit has to be equal to 0. So we can divide both sides of this equation by 36, which is the same thing as dividing by 4 times 9. So this term right over here, we could get rid of one 4 and one 4. And we're going to get a 9 m squared b squared over here. And then we divided by 36, so these all go away. So it's going to be 9 m squared b squared plus this thing times this thing. So let's see what that is. So we have a 4 times a b squared. So we have plus 4 b squared. Let me do this in a different color. I'll do it in blue. So plus 4 b squared. And then you have 4 times 4. So plus 16. And you have negative 9 m squared times b squared. So it's negative 9 m squared b squared. And then you have negative 9 m squared times 4. So negative 36 m squared. And that's going to be equal to 0. Lucky for us, that and that cancel out. And then we are left with something. And actually, what we're left with, everything is divisible by 4. So let's divide what we're left with by 4. So then we're left with b squared-- that's that term. And then minus 9 m squared. That's that term over there. Just divided it by 4. And then plus 4 is equal to 0. And once again, we could use-- well actually here, we don't have to do anything. We don't have to use quadratic formula. We could just solve for b. We could subtract this from both sides. And so we'll get b squared is equal to the square root of 9 m squared minus 4. Sorry-- let me just write this-- I don't want to skip steps here. b squared is equal to 9 m squared minus 4. They're painting the office right now, so maybe it's making me a little bit-- making my brain not work properly. Then b is equal to the square root of 9 m squared minus 4. Did I do that right? Let's see. I got the 4. Yeah, it looks right. And so we're left with a situation where the b-- if we're saying that if the line is tangent to the hyperbola it to be this, and if the line is tangent to the circle b has to be equal to this, this business over here. So let me copy it and then let me paste it. Let me paste it. Just like that. And so we now have two equations with two unknowns. We can set these equal to each other and solve for m. And this will give us the m or the slope of that tangent line. And then we can go ahead and solve for b. I'll do that in the next video.",math_precalculus_conics
" Let's now parameterize our surface. And then, we can figure out what ds would actually look like. And so I will define my position vector function for our surface as r. And I'm going to make it a function of two parameters because we're going to have to define a surface right over here. And I can actually use x and y as my parameters because the surface can be defined as a function of x and y. So I'll say that my parameterization is going to be a function of x and y. And in my i direction, it's going to be x times i. In my j direction, it's going to be y times j. And then, in the k direction, well, that's just going to be z. And z is a function of x and y. And whenever you do a parameterization of a surface, you have to think about, well, what are the constraints on the domain for your parameters? And so the constraints of the domain for my parameters, I'm going to say that every pair of xy-- every xy coordinate-- it has to be a member-- this is the symbol for member-- it has to be a member of this little region right over here. We could call this the domain of the parameters. It has to be a member of r. Actually, we assume that up here. And actually, I should have written this as the coordinates of xy-- the xy pairs that are a member of r-- that's going to help define our surface. An xy that is not a member of r, then we're not going to consider that the z of that xy as part of the surface. Only the z of xy's where the xy's are part of this region. So now that we have a parameterization for our surface, we're ready to start thinking about what ds might be. And we need to think about this a little bit carefully. So first, I'll just write something. And then, we can confirm whether this really will be the case. ds-- and we've seen this before about why this is the case-- is going to be the cross product of the partial derivative of this with respect to each of the parameters times the little chunk of area in that domain. You could view it as the partial of r of this parameterization with respect to x crossed with the partial of r with respect to y. And then, that whole thing-- and we actually want this to be a vector, not just the absolute value or the magnitude of this vector. We actually want this to be a vector. That thing times-- we could put in some order dx dy or we could write dy dx. And if we want to be general just to say that it's a little differential of our region right over here, we can just write-- instead of writing dx dy or dy dx-- we will write da. And the reason why I said we need to be careful is we need to make sure, based on how we've parameterized this position vector function, based on how we parameterized it, whether this cross product really points in the right direction, the direction that we need to be oriented in. Because, remember, if we're traversing a boundary like this, we want to make sure that the surface is oriented the right way. And the way we think about-- if we were to twist a cap like this, the cap would move up. Or if you were to walk around this boundary in this direction with the surface to your left, your head would point up. And so we need to make sure that this vector, which really defines the orientation of the surface, is definitely going to be pointed up or above the surface as opposed to going below the surface. And so let's think about that a little bit. The partial derivative with respect to x-- well, as x gets bigger, it's going to go in that direction along the surface. And the partial with respect to y, as y gets bigger, it's going to go in that direction along the surface. If I take r cross y-- and we could use the right-hand rule here. We put our index finger in the direction of the first thing we're taking the cross product of, our middle finger in the direction of the second thing. So just like that. We bend our middle finger. We don't care what the other fingers are doing. So I'll just draw them right there. Then, the thumb will go in the direction of the cross product. So in this case, the thumb is going to point up. And that's exactly what we wanted to happen. So this actually is the right ordering. The partial with respect to y cross the partial with respect to x actually would not have been right. That would have given us the other orientation. We would have done that if this boundary actually went the other way around. But this is the right orientation given the way that we are going to traverse the boundary. Now, with that out of the way, let's actually calculate this cross product. So let me just rewrite it. So this is going to be equal to-- well, I'll just focus on the cross product right now. The partial of r with respect to x crossed with the partial of r with respect to y is going to be equal to-- and we've done this many times already. We'll just do it in more general terms now. It's going to be equal to the determit of this matrix-- i, j, and k. Let me do those in different colors. I think that's a helpful way of thinking about it. So i, j, and k. Actually, I'll use this magenta color. i, j, and k. Let me write this line right over here. We want to write the different components of the partial with respect to x. And so the partial of the i component with respect to x is just going to be 1. The partial of the j component with respect to x is going to be 0. And the partial of this with respect to x, well, we can just write that as a partial derivative of the function z with respect to x. And so r sub x-- or the partial with respect to x-- is the vector 1, i plus 0, j plus z sub x, k. And we'll do the same thing for this piece right over here. The partial with respect to y-- it's i component, well, this is going to be 0. It's j component is going to be 1. The partial of this with respect to y is 1. And the partial of this with respect to y is the partial of z with respect to y. And actually, I forgot to write k right over here in our parameterization. So now with all of this set up, we are ready to figure out what the cross product is. The cross product is going to be equal to-- so our i component is going to be 0 times the partial with respect to y minus 1 times the partial of z with respect to x. So we get negative partial of z with respect to x. And then, checkerboard pattern. We'll have minus j times-- so ignore that column, that row-- 1 times the partial with respect to y. So that's z sub y-- the partial of z with respect to y-- minus 0 times this. So we're just left with that right over there. And then, finally, we're going to have plus k. And here we have 1 times 1 minus 0 times 0. So it's going to be k times 1. So we can just write k over there. And so we can write, the cross product really is just equal to negative z sub x times i minus z sub y times j plus k.",math_multivariable-calculus_greens-theorem-and-stokes-theorem
" -  What we're going to do using our powers of calculus is find the area of this yellow region and if at any point you get inspired, I always encourage you to pause the video and try to work through it on your own. So, the key here is you might recognize hey, this is an area between curves. A definite integral might be useful, so I'll just set up the definite integral sign and so, first we're gonna think about what are left and right boundaries of our region? Well, it looks like the left boundary is where the two graphs intersect right over here and the right boundary is where they intersect right over there. Well, what is this point of intersection? It looks like it is negative one, negative two. We can verify that. In this red curve, if X is negative one, let's see, you square that, you'll get one minus three. You do indeed get Y is equal to negative two and in this blue function was X is equal to negative one, you get one minus four plus one. Once again, you do indeed get Y is equal to negative two and the same thing is true when X is equal to one. One minus three, negative two, one minus four plus one, negative two. So, our bounds are indeed, we're going from X equals negative one to X equals positive one and now let's think about our upper and lower bounds. Over that interval this blue graph is our upper bound and so, we would subtract the lower bound from the upper bound, so we would have X to the fourth, minus four X squared plus one and from that we will subtract X squared minus three DX and in many other videos we have talked about why you do this, why this makes sense to just subtract the lower graph from the upper graph when you're finding the area between them but now we just have to evaluate this definite integral, so let's just get down to business. Alright, so we have the integral from negative one to one, and so, we have X to the fourth, X to the fourth, and now we have minus four X squared and then when you distribute this negative sign, you're gonna subtract another X squared, so you're gonna have minus five X squared and then you have plus one and then you're gonna subtract a negative three, so it's gonna be one plus three, so it's gonna be plus four DX, DX and just to be clear I should put parentheses right over there because it's really the DX is being multiplied by this entire expression and so, let's see, let's find the antiderivative of this. This should be pretty straightforward. We're just gonna use the reverse power rule multiple times, so this is going to be the antiderivative of X to the fourth is X to the fifth over five. We just incremented the exponent and divided by that incremented exponent, minus, same idea here, five X to the third over three plus four X and then we are going to evaluate it at one and then subtract from that and evaluate it at negative one. So, let's first evaluate it at one. We're gonna get 1/5 minus 5/3 plus four and now let us evaluate it at negative one, so minus, let's see, if this is negative one, we get a negative 1/5, negative 1/5 and this is gonna be plus 5/3, plus 5/3 and then this is going to be minus four, minus four but then when you distribute the negative sign, we're going to distribute this over all of these terms, and so this is going to be, if we make this positive, this will be positive, this one will be negative and then this one will be positive, so you have 1/5 plus 1/5 which is going to be 2/5, that and that, and then minus 5/3, minus 5/3, so minus 10 over three and then four plus four, so plus eight and so, we just need to simplify this. This is going to be, let's see, it's going to be eight and then if I write, so plus, I'm gonna write these two with a denominator of 15 'cause that's the common denominator of three and five. Let's see, 2/5 is 16/15, yeah, that's right, five times three is 15. Two times three is six and then 10/3, let's see, if we multiply the denominator times fives, we have to multiply the numerator times five, so this is going to be 50/15 and so, what's 6/15 minus 50/15? So, this is going to be equal to eight minus six minus 50 is minus 44, minus 44 over 15 and so what is 44 over 15? 44 over 15 is equal to two and 14/15, so that's really what we're subtracting. We're gonna subtract two and 14/15, so if you subtract two from this you would get six minus 14 over 15 'cause we still have to subtract the 14/15 and then six minus 14/15 is going to be equal to five and 1/15. So, just like that, we were indeed able to figure out this area.",math_ap-calculus-ab_ab-applications-of-integration-new
" SALMAN KHAN: I'm here with Professor Laurence Baker from Stanford Medical School, and I'm hoping he can at least start to get me to understand something that I've always wondered about and worried about a little bit. Let's say that I'm some drug company. So let me write this down. So I'm some pharma company, pharma company A right over here, and let's say that I invest 10 years and $100 million in some drug. I get it through all of the clinical trials, and it gets approved by the FDA. And let's say, just for sake of simplicity, it cures disease x. Now once I get to that point, I'm feeling pretty good about myself as a pharma company. What happens next? I'm assuming that I'm going to have to go to the insurance companies and maybe Medicaid and Medicare and figure out how much they're going to pay for it, but how does that conversation even happen? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. So you're going to have a conversation with a bunch of different folks. In the US, we have lots of different private insurance plans. We've got government plans. And you're actually going to have conversations with Europe and with some of the other systems around the world, because each system is going to make its own decision. SALMAN KHAN: And they have a different way of doing it. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: They may some have similarities in the way that they probably want to talk to you about. SALMAN KHAN: Does there tend to be a lead system? Does it tend to be either the Europeans, or does it tend to be the private insurers in the US? Or do you just start all of those conversations at once because there's so much money on the table? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: So there will be some strategy your business is going to come to because it's very hard to have all of these conversations exactly simultaneously. So you'll talk to the US. You'll talk to Europe. And there are some cases in which people have viewed the regulatory processes in Europe as a little easier for some things, so they may want to start in Europe. But in other cases, if you're looking at a drug that maybe some of the national systems in Europe are less likely to want to pay for, you might want to start with the US, where there's a little more flexibility. SALMAN KHAN: But the general rule of thumb is all the money is in Europe and the US mainly right now. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: A lot of it. The Asian systems, some of them are pretty sophisticated and using a lot of the advanced drugs, too, but I think the majority of the money is in the US and Europe, North America. SALMAN KHAN: And between Europe and the US, I guess I've always imagined North America was maybe where the bulk of the money was. But is that the case? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: The US, well, our health care system spends more than everybody in the world, and it's true for drugs, too. We spend more on drugs here than most other places. SALMAN KHAN: OK. So definitely if I'm here, pharma company A, I want to make sure I get this right in the US. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. Eventually you probably care a lot about the US. SALMAN KHAN: Part of my investment that I made is based on some understanding that, if I got all the way through, that I would get some type of return within the US. Will I necessarily immediately go to Medicare because they're one of the largest players, or will I go to, like we talked about, Blue Cross Blue Shield or Kaiser or some of these other players? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: So Medicare is actually an interesting one for drug prices because, historically, Medicare has not been a big coverer and still isn't of a lot of the drugs that you hear about. So Medicare does not pay by itself for outpatient drugs, drugs that you might take at home. SALMAN KHAN: Really? I always assumed that-- they don't. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: So Medicare, in its main pieces-- Medicare, we call Part A, Part B, Part C-- so Part A and Part B, let's start there. They tend not to cover, or they don't cover, outpatient drugs. If you get a drug in the hospital while you're hospitalized, Medicare will pay for those. And so if you've got a drug that's going to be primarily used in that setting, you're going to talk to Medicare about it, and that's going to be an important piece of the conversation. But if you're talking about an outpatient drug, you're talking to many [INAUDIBLE]. SALMAN KHAN: Now, when we're saying outpatient, inpatient is you're in the hospital. You're sick. You need, I don't know, morphine right now. That's inpatient drug. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. SALMAN KHAN: Outpatient is, hey, you're going back home. Take this three times a day. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. Somebody sends you to the pharmacy to pick up the prescription, and you take it home with you. That's going to be an outpatient kind of drug. So Medicare doesn't cover that in its main Part A and Part B. There's Medicare Part D, which is a drug plan in Medicare, and that will cover a lot of the outpatient drugs. And so there you'd have conversations with them. But most of the Medicare Part D plans are essentially private companies that Medicare contracts with. So you're not really talking to the government at that point. You're talking to these private plans that have contracted with Medicare to provide Part D care. SALMAN KHAN: So once again going back to the crux of the question of how are these drugs going to get paid for, how are we going to determine the price at which these drugs get paid for, it goes straight back to the private plans again because they're going to contract. Part D is going to say, oh, you're Medicare Part D. We're going to go to go to Aetna. We're going to go to some other plan or whoever it might be. I don't know who it might be. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Whoever is offering those Part D plans. SALMAN KHAN: Whoever is offering those Part D plans-- and so it will ride off of whatever that private party has already negotiated with the pharma company. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: It would be related, probably, to that. SALMAN KHAN: OK. So let's say that we have some type of insurance. I'm running out of letters now. Let's call this insurance company Y right over here. And I go have a conversation with insurance company Y, and I'm like, hey, this is a big deal. Disease x, you know it's been killing people. I want $1 million per pill. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, and so those have been really interesting conversations in the US. So there's some bargaining back and forth between the insurance company and the drugmaker. The drugmaker is going to have spent a lot of money. You've got $100 million up there. SALMAN KHAN: Yes. I deserve to make at least $10 billion off-- I'm only kidding. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: So there's a certain amount, to a certain extent [INAUDIBLE]. SALMAN KHAN: It's called anchoring in a negotiation. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Right. You start with what you think you can get. SALMAN KHAN: Yes. Absolutely, yeah. [? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Push ?] that number to get everybody's mind around, yeah. So in reality, it costs well over $100 million to take a drug through the trials, to do the development work. So they're going to be sitting there with a number, at least internally, saying, we want to get our $800 million, our $1.5 billion back from this. And so we're going to try and price it accordingly. SALMAN KHAN: Because it's not just the cost of that one drug-- so what is the cost? Do you know that off the top of your head, the average drug? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: It's hundreds of millions. So there's the development costs that go in that the pharma companies aren't typically willing to talk a lot about. And then there's the cost of getting through the trials and the FDA approvals, which people say $500 million and up. They'll say higher numbers sometimes. SALMAN KHAN: For one given drug? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. SALMAN KHAN: $500 million. So it can be as high as $500 million. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: It can be higher. SALMAN KHAN: Can be greater than $500 million. And so that doesn't even take into the probability-weighted risk, that there's a 10% chance that it fails or a 10% chance that it works. So it's really, if you're spending $100 million per drug and only 1 out of 10 of those drugs are going to get to the end zone-- PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. You'll see along the way. You won't spend a whole wad and then find out. You'll find out in steps. So you'll have to spend something to get there. SALMAN KHAN: I see. You'll stop. So even though on one drug, it might be $100 million or $500 million, they might have spent another $300 million or $400 million on drugs that didn't go anywhere. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Plus their own development costs in the background. SALMAN KHAN: Plus their own development costs. So if you try to fully load the cost, it's a large number. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: It's large, yeah. Right. Exactly. They're running an operation where they've got to put in a lot of money in up front. When they get a success, they have to get enough out of that one success to pay for the operation, to keep things going for the next development round. So they're looking at those kinds of numbers, and they're trying to figure out in this negotiation what they can sell this for. And that's a back and forth discussion. The insurance companies have some ability to say what they're willing to pay, but a lot of these drugs, if they're doing the curing a disease that people care about, the pharma companies have a lot of ability to come and say, this is what we need to get for this and set that price and be able to get it for a while. SALMAN KHAN: So obviously, the pharma company is coming here with all of this investment. They definitely want it to get covered. But the insurance company, their incentive is they don't want to look like, all of the sudden, this company that doesn't provide the cure for disease x. Do insurance companies ever walk away and say, well, that's just too much. I understand you invested all of this money, but we just can't do that. That's just crazy. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: So it's a little bit of a mixed bag. The US doesn't have a lot of cases where insurance companies have really put their foot down and said, no, they're not going to do anything. They're not going to have anything to do with some new drug that comes out. And some of that's due to the existence of lots of different companies. So if five of the companies say no but the next guy in line says yes, then the dynamic of that in a competitive market is often that everybody else will eventually come around and say, OK, we're going to [INAUDIBLE]. SALMAN KHAN: Someone is going to do something. They might not pay for it outright. The whole reason why we're having this conversation is because there are some drugs that seem reasonably priced to me, but there are some that are like $30,000 a pill or something. I made up that number. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. So the cases, the really expensive ones, are drugs that are unique-- tend to be unique, at least to some extent-- cure disease that gets some high profile, so people are worried that they're going to die if they don't get this drug. And of course, they're still on patent. That's another feature of all this, where you get the high price for a certain period of time until your patents run out. SALMAN KHAN: And then the generic-- PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: And then generic comes in and the price-- SALMAN KHAN: Can make them for the cost of the pill, which is-- PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: It drops dramatically. SALMAN KHAN: Pennies or dollars. PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: So how you get these things set in a competitive market is an interesting question. One of things that gets the brand name drugs to be a little cheaper is competition within the class. So if there is two or three drug manufacturers who have something that will basically do the same thing, that will tend to take the edge off the $30,000 a pill kind of situation and get you down to more reasonable prices. It won't get you all the way to generic pricing, but [INAUDIBLE]. SALMAN KHAN: It just seems to me-- you just mentioned that very few insurance companies have ever walked away from this. If you ever have a negotiation-- buying a used car-- where one of the two parties is not walking away, then it doesn't seem like there's actually a hard, serious negotiation. Am I getting that wrong? PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, I don't know all the ins and outs of all these negotiations. There's lots that goes on in these things. But I think that one of the things that people would say about the US is that when a drug manufacturer comes up with fairly unique, on-patent drug that does some tangible good, that they more or less can set the price that they want to get for it. And they're going to make some calculation, because they could set a high enough price that everybody would say forget it. So they're going to try and figure out something. But they're trying to get as much as they can, and they get some leeway for at least a period of time to name that price. SALMAN KHAN: So they'll get leeway, and I guess there's some range of reasonableness where it's like, OK. Yes, you've done something amazing for humanity. You're going to get a 35% return on your investment, 1but that shouldn't be a 300% return on your investment. 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. 1I don't know at what point the US would ever walk 1or the private insurers will ever walk from this. 1I haven't seen it really happen, and I 1think drug companies are pretty sophisticated about trying 1to figure out what price they think 1they can make work and get that as high as they can get that. 1SALMAN KHAN: So I guess I'm still 1unclear to see who's making out here really well. 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: This has 1been a really interesting debate. 1Pharma companies put huge amounts of money 1into these drugs. 1And once in a while, they do some really useful things, 1and they get high premiums. 1There are other people who argue that some 1of the things that they're getting high premiums for 1aren't really valuable enough or somehow we've 1been told we need a drug that, if we had it 1to our own devices, we would never have come up 1with the fact that we need it. 1And so what's the real value at the end of the day? 1And I think that's one of the debates we're 1going to have in this country for a little while. 1The industry has been coming up with new things, 1and they're going to keep trying to do that. 1We want to, from a social standpoint, from a policy 1standpoint, try to make sure that things we're doing 1are really valuable to society and not copies of other drugs 1or not inventing a disease that didn't need a solution 1and then solving the problem. 1And sometimes we worry that maybe we're 1getting some of that. 1And I think that's the challenge for the US health insurance 1system, for the regulatory processes 1to try to guide the innovation and guide 1the purchasing of these things to really create 1the most value for society. 1It's been a challenge. 1It's going to be a challenge. 1We have the challenge, because we have tremendous opportunity 1with new drugs created. 1SALMAN KHAN: So your gut sense is there probably 1are some drugs out there that they're doing really well, 1well above and beyond the investment cost, 1but it's hard to say. 1It's really on a case by case basis. 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, I 1don't think you'd want to make a generic statement about all 1the drugs that have been discovered. 1Some of the things that we've put out there 1in the last couple of decades are really 1important drugs that are going to do a lot of good. 1And I think there are debates about some other ones where 1maybe somebody's been able to be clever about marketing 1and sell it, and we're less sure that it's [INAUDIBLE]. 1SALMAN KHAN: And that, actually, marketing-- I 1don't want to make this conversation too long-- 1but some people bring up that the drug companies, they say, 1look, there's a lot of investment right 1over here on this. 1And so they have to get some reasonable return on it, 1and that seems to make sense, especially when you probability 1weight it and all of that. 1But they spend a significant amount of marketing 1as well, on actual marketing. 1You watch the nightly news, most of the ads, 1you're going to see a drug company. 1They do the physician dinners, and they do all of their things 1like that. 1That seems to undermine that argument that all of the money 1is going for R&D. 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Right. 1If you just totalled up the dollars, 1I'm not sure what the numbers would come out like, 1and honestly, the pharma companies 1aren't really excited about telling everybody 1all of the details of their businesses for good reason. 1So absolutely, there's a huge amount 1of marketing [INAUDIBLE]. 1SALMAN KHAN: You spend a ton of money on the marketing. 1And then you get the consumer here 1to put the pressure on the insurance 1companies and the doctors to say, hey, you better cover 1that, or I'm asking for that. 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. 1There was a time within my memory 1where we weren't allowed to do direct to consumer 1marketing, where the laws prohibited that. 1And the change came around, and now we're allowed to do it. 1And it's really changed the way that drugs are marketed. 1SALMAN KHAN: And I have found that weird 1because, if these are drugs that are meant 1to be by prescription, which means that it should be 1a doctor's judgment on whether or not 1you should get the drugs, why is it being advertised 1on the nightly news to a general audience? 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Right-- a general 1audience who doesn't understand all the ins and outs 1of the drug and whose doctor may or may not 1want to take the time to explain it all to them. 1SALMAN KHAN: Exactly. 1But then they'll go to the doctor and say, please 1give me this drug. 1And then the doctor, it's easier for them to say, well, sure. 1Why not? 1PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah. 1No, I think a lot of doctors would 1express a certain amount of frustration about that. 1Their patients come in. 1It's hard to have the conversation in a short period 1of time, so it's easier just to give them the drug. 1SALMAN KHAN: Fascinating.",science_health-and-medicine_health-care-system
"  In this video, we're going to see if we can graph a rational function. A rational function is just a function that has an expression on the numerator and the denominator. It has a polynomial in the numerator-- Let's see, we have x squared over-- and another polynomial in the denominator --x squared minus 16. We could obviously graph this by just trying out a bunch of points and then connecting the dots. That's what a calculator would do for us, a graphing calculator. But what we want to do is, before we try out some points to kind of fill in the gaps, I want to understand the basic structure of this graph first. And to understand that, I want to see what happens as x gets really big, so x gets really big, or x gets really, really small, as x goes in the negative direction. Or another way we could think about it, I want to understand what happens as the magnitude of x, or the absolute value of x, becomes really big as it approaches really, really bigness, or as it approaches infinity. So when the size of x approaches infinity. Which essentially is saying, as x goes really far in the positive direction, or x goes really far in the negative direction, what is going to happen to the value of this function? So let's get out a calculator. Won't use the graphing part of it just yet, but let's just try out some values. What happens when x is equal to 10? It's going to be the same thing as when x is equal to negative 10, because when you put a negative 10 here, you square it, you get 100, just like 10. Same here, negative 10, you square it, you get the same thing as a positive 10. So whether you go in the super high positive direction or the super low negative direction, as you approach positive or negative infinity, you're going to approach the same thing because you're squaring the values. But let's try out some values. If I get 10 squared divided by 10 squared minus 16, I get 1.19. Now what happens if x gets a little bit bigger? This is x is equal to 10. What happens when x is equal to 100? We have 100 squared divided by 100 squared minus 16. I'm getting even closer to 1. When x was 10, around here, we're getting y is 1.19. When x is 100, 100 squared over 100 squared minus 16, y is 1.0016. Just for fun, let's try 1,000. So it's 1,000 squared divided by 1,000 squared minus 16. And we're even closer to 1. So as the size of x gets larger and larger and larger, our y gets closer and closer to 1. And that would also be true if this was a negative 10, because negative 10 squared over negative 10 squared minus 16 is going to be the exact same thing. Because the negative, when you square it, is going to be a positive. It's going to be the same thing as 10 squared, same thing over here. So whether x gets really big or x gets really small, we're going to be approaching y is equal to 1. You could try it with a million if you want, and you're going to get a number even closer to 1. So as the size of x approaches infinity, the absolute value of x, or the distance from the origin, approaches infinity, y is approaching 1. Or another way to think about it is, the graph of this function is going to approach the line y is equal to 1. So let me graph the line y is equal to 1. So I'll do it in a dotted line because this isn't the graph of our function, but this is a line that our function is approaching. So that is the graph of y is equal to 1. Now, this idea of a function, or the graph of a function, approaching a line but never quite touching it. So this is going to get closer and closer and closer to this line, y equal to one, in that direction, but never quite getting close enough to it. It'll approach 0, its distance from this y equals 1, but it'll never quite get there. This line that the graph is approaching is called an asymptote.  And it'll be even more clear once I actually graph the function. We're going to work up there. And since it's a horizontal line, we call this a horizontal asymptote.  This is what our graph approaches as we go in the positive direction, or really far in the negative direction. Let's think about some of the other interesting things about this, about this function right here. Well one thing that might pop out at you is this is a difference of squares. This is x squared minus 4 squared. So we can rewrite this as x squared over x plus 4 times x minus 4. So what's going to happen here, as x approaches either positive 4, or x approaches negative 4? Well, first of all, try those values out. If x is equal to 4, what is going to happen? This expression right here, this term right here, is going to be equal to 0. And we're going to be dividing by 0. We cannot do that. Similarly, if x is equal to negative 4, we'd be dividing by 0. This expression, right here, is going to be equal to 0. We can't do that. We could say that this function is undefined at x is equal to plus or minus 4. It can't equal those values because we'd be dividing by 0 in either one of those circumstances. Now, what happens as we approach those values? What happens as x approaches negative 4? Let's just do that one for fun. What happens as x approaches negative 4? Let's say we're approaching it from the negative direction.  So let's try it out in our calculator.  So let's say we want to go from the negative direction. So let's start with negative 4.1. So if we have negative 4.1 squared divided by negative 4.1 squared minus 16, what do we get? We get 20.75. So we get this number, whatever. Let's see if we get even closer to negative 4. So let me just get that entry there. So let's get a little bit closer to negative 4. So instead of negative 4.1, let's do negative 4.01. So let me insert a negative 4.01. And then over here, this is negative 4.01, and see what it is. Now we went to 200, so we're getting to larger and larger values. Let's try negative 4.001. Let's try that out.  Whoops, that's not what I wanted to do. I wanted to do that. So let's try. No that's not what I want to do. Let's see. So we want to go to, instead of 4.01, I want to do 4.001, and over there, negative 4.001. And what do we get? We get 2,000. So as we get closer and closer to negative 4 from the negative direction, we're approaching larger and larger, super larger numbers. And you can try it, if it's 4.0000001, it's going to get to smaller and smaller numbers-- or sorry, larger and larger numbers here. If you do 4.001, it's probably going to be 20,000. And then if you add another 0 here. So as we get closer and closer, it's getting to larger and larger numbers. So we could say, as x approaches negative 4, we could say y is approaching infinity. It's getting to a larger and larger and larger value. But we can't ever quite get to x is equal to 4. It's undefined there. That will make the denominator here equal to 0. So what we want to do here is, we can never quite equal x equal negative 4. So let me see, x is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4. We can never quite get to x is equal to negative 4. Let me draw x is equal to negative 4 as a dotted line, right there. That is x is equal to negative 4.  We can never quite get there, but as we approached it from the negative side, as we had 4.1, then 4.01, we went to larger and larger values. And we also know that as we went on the left-hand side, as we go to larger and larger x values, that y will get closer and closer to 1. So you have a general sense of what this part of the graph will look like. This part of the graph is going to look something like that. As x gets to super negative numbers, it gets closer and closer to 1, as x gets closer and closer to negative 4 from the negative direction, it's going to go closer and closer to infinity. You're going to get closer and closer to a very-- It's going to get larger and larger, I guess, is an easy way to say it. Now, just like x equal negative 4, x equals 4 will also be a point where the graph is undefined. So let me graph that here. 1, 2, 3, 4. Right here.  Right over here. x is equal to 4. And, once again, what happens as we approach x equals 4, let's say from the positive direction? So as x approaches 4 from the positive direction, what's 1going to happen? 1So this is like trying out x is equal to 4.01, or x is 1equal to 4.001, or x is equal to 4.0001. 1So we're just getting closer and closer and closer to x is 1equal to 4. 1Well, these values are the exact same values that we just 1tried on our calculator, except they are the negative 1version of them, right? 1And we already saw that, just the way that this function is 1set up, the negative numbers, they get squared, so whether 1you take the negative or the positive x values, it's going 1to be the same thing. 1This graph is symmetric. 1When x is equal to negative 5, it's the same thing 1as x is equal 5. 1When x is equal to negative 10, it's the same 1thing as x equals 10. 1So the same thing is going to happen. 1You could try it out with your calculator, if you like. 1If you try out these values, you're going to see, as we get 1closer and closer to 4, we're going to approach larger and 1larger numbers. 1These same numbers over here. 1So the graph over here, as we get closer and closer to 4, 1we're going to approach larger and larger numbers. 1And then here, as x gets larger and larger and larger, 1we saw over here, we had these horizontal asymptotes, y gets 1closer and closer to 1. 1So just like we called this a horizontal asymptote, these 1values-- or you can even view these vertical lines: x is 1equal to negative 4 and x is equal to 4 --we call these 1vertical asymptotes. 1 1These are lines, asymptotes, once again, they are lines 1that the graph approaches, but never quite touches. 1So that's what's going on here. 1And then we can think about what's happening to the graph 1inside of here. 1So you could think of it in a couple of ways. 1You could say, well, what happens as x approaches 4 from 1the negative direction? 1So let's try that out, from the negative direction. 1So what happens if you do 3.9 squared divided by 3.9 1squared minus 16? 1You get negative 19.25. 1Now what happens if we do 3.99? 1So let me put another 9 here. 1So we're going to get closer and closer to 4, and we're 1going to do it from the left-hand side 1as we approach 4. 1So insert another 9 here. 1So even more negative. 1So let's just do one more. 1So we're going to be even more negative. 1So let me make it 3.999. 1Get even closer to 4. 1 1You're getting even more negative. 1And this is also going to be true if we did negative 3.9, 1or negative 3.99, or negative 3.999, because when we square 1it, the negatives and the positives are the same thing. 1You square negative 1, you get a positive 1. 1So as we approach 4 from-- you go 3.9, 3.99, we get closer 1and closer to 4 --we're getting more and 1more negative numbers. 1We approach negative infinity. 1So as we approach-- let me just graph it here. 1As we approach from this direction, we're going to get 1smaller-- want to not touch our asymptote --it's going to 1look something like that. 1As we approach it from the left-hand side, we're getting 1smaller and smaller numbers. 1And that's also going to be true as we approach negative 4 1from the right-hand side, right? 1As we get negative 3.9, 3.99, 3.999, we're 1going to drop down. 1It's going to look something like that. 1And now that we have a general sense of what the graph is, 1now is a good time where we could maybe plot 1a few points here. 1And the easiest one is, what happens when x is equal to 0? 1You have 0 squared over 0 squared minus 16. 1So the point when x is equal to 0, we're going to have 0 1over, well, negative 16, which is just 0. 1So the point 0, 0 is on this curve. 1And then we could try some other points if you like, but 1the general shape here is going to look 1something like this. 1 1You could plot more points if you really want to nail down 1exactly what the curve is doing in between, but here is 1the general structure. 1And we tried out a lot of values with the calculator. 1And I did that because I really wanted to show you why 1it's dropping down like this. 1And if you think about it, it makes complete sense. 1As you get closer and closer, let's say you get closer and 1closer to 4. 1Either way, as you get closer and closer to 4, this is going 1to become a smaller and smaller and smaller number, 1because this is the difference between x and 4. 1So this is becoming a smaller and 1smaller and smaller number. 1Then, when you take 1 over that, right? 1You can essentially view this as x squared over x plus 4, or 1times 1 over x minus 4. 1If this is becoming smaller and smaller, this whole thing, 11 over a super small number, is a super large number. 1So as you can imagine, you're going to get larger and 1larger, and depending on whether you are approaching 1from the positive or negative, so whether this is a super 1small negative number or super small positive number, that's 1going to flip the sign. 1But either way, the magnitude-- So we're getting 1to a very large magnitude in the negative direction because 1the difference between x and 4 on this side 1is negative, right? 13.9 minus 4 is 0.1. 1Take the inverse of that, it's 10. 1So we're getting negative numbers here. 1You take the inverse, you're going to get super large 1negative numbers. 1So I really want to give you that intuition. 1But the general way of being able to graph these type of 1things, your first thing you want to do is identify the 1horizontal asymptotes. 1What happens as we get very-- the magnitude of our x is very 1large, so super positive values or 1super negative values. 1You could try it out on a calculator, if you like. 1You literally, if you try out the value of a million or a 1billion, it will kind of give you the answer. 1But the way you could also think about it is, as x gets 1really large, you could view that this thing, these terms 1right here grow so much faster-- I mean this is just a 1constant term. 1This term doesn't matter anymore. 1If this is a million and a million, who 1cares about the 16? 1So as x gets really large, you could say that y is 1approximately x squared over x squared. 1These two terms dominate. 1You don't need to worry about the 16 anymore. 1And of course, this is equal to 1, which is exactly what we 1got when we plugged in really large numbers. 1So, in a problem like this, where you have the same 1coefficient, or where you have the same degree on the 1numerator and the denominator, you look at the coefficient of 1those terms. So in this case, the coefficient is 1 and 1. 1So our horizontal asymptote is going to be 1 divided by 1, or 1y is equal to 1. 1If this was 2x squared over x squared minus 16, our 1horizontal asymptote would be y is equal to 2. 1We would approach that line, up there. 1If it was a negative 2, our horizontal asymptote would be 1y is equal to negative 2. 1So that's how you identify the horizontal asymptotes where 1you have the same degree in the numerator and the 1denominator. 1If the denominator has a larger degree, then the 1denominator is going to get larger much faster than the 1numerator, and your asymptote is going to be 0. 1I'll show an example of that in the future. 1And obviously, if your numerator has a higher degree 1than your denominator, it's going to grow way faster than 1your denominator, and you won't have any asymptote. 1You'll just keep growing, or keep going in 1the negative direction. 1And that's actually the case with all of the polynomials 1we've seen. 1You can do them all as being over 1. 1In which case, there was no horizontal asymptote. 1Now the vertical asymptotes you identify by essentially 1just factoring the denominator and figuring out where 1does it equal 0. 1Those are the points where the function is not defined. 1And I'll show you in the future, there are some special 1cases where they won't be vertical asymptotes, and I 1guess that special case is, for example, if you had-- 1Well, I won't show you the special case right now. 1I'll show you that in a future video. 1But in general, if you factor the bottom terms and they 1don't cancel out with anything on the numerator, then you're 1going to be dealing with a vertical asymptote. 1If I had another x minus 4 up here, if my numerator was x 1squared times x minus 4, and then these canceled out, and 1my expression simplified to this, the equation would still 1be undefined at x is equal to 4, because you would give the 10 in the denominator. 1But since that x minus 4 cancels out with the x minus 4 1in the numerator, it would not have 1been a vertical asymptote. 1We'll look at that in the future. 1But this equation wasn't that. 1So the general rule of thumb for identifying the vertical 1asymptotes, factor the denominator, figure out where 1the denominator equals 0, and if those terms don't cancel 1out with any terms of the numerator, then those are 1vertical asymptotes. 1And then to figure out the behavior, I guess, within the 1asymptotes, you can plot some points. 1You can try out some points. 1You can actually substitute values for x and 1figure out what y is. 1Now just to validate that we hopefully got the right 1answer, let's actually graph our rational function. 1So let me turn it on. 1Let me graph it. 1And we say y is equal to x squared divided by x 1squared minus 16. 1And let's see what we get. 1Nope, I just want to graph it. 1My range is off. 1Let me do my range. 1Let me see, x minimum value I want for x, let's say it's 1negative 10. 1My maximum value I want for x is 10. 1x scale is 1. y minimum value, I want negative 10. 2y maximum value, I want 10. 2Then y scale, I want 1. 2Now let me graph it. 2There we go. 2Look at that. 2Just like what we drew. 2We have an asymptote, as x gets really large, or x gets 2really, really small, that asymptote is y is equal to 1. 2We have our vertical asymptote. 2It graphed it because it tried to connect the dots, but it 2essentially graphed our asymptotes for us, but that 2wouldn't actually be part of the graph. 2But as we approach 4 from 0, I guess we can 2say, we go super negative. 2As we approach negative 4 from 0, we get super negative. 2Because in either of those situations, as you approach 4 2from this side, this term is going to be negative. 2As you approach negative 4 from thid side, this term, 2right here, is going to be-- Well, this term right here is 2going to be positive, but then this term right here is going 2to be negative. 2Negative times a positive, you could play 2with it as you like. 2But we approach negative infinity in either case. 2And then as x approaches infinity, this thing 2asymptotes away. 2So hopefully you found that fun. 2",math_algebra2_rational
" -  We're told the polynomial p of x, which is equal to this, has a known factor of x plus six. Rewrite p of x as a product of linear factors. Pause this video, and see if you can have a go at that. All right, now let's work on this together. Because they give us one of the factors, what we can do is say hey, what happens if I divide x plus six into p of x? What do I have left over? It looks like I'm still going to have a quadratic, and then I'll probably have to factor that somehow to get a product of linear factors. So let's get going. So if I were to try to figure out what x plus six divided into, x to the third plus nine x squared, and now we're gonna have to be careful. You might be tempted to just write minus 108 there, but then this gets tricky because you have your third degree column, your second degree column. You need your first degree column, but you just put your zero degree, your constant column here. So to make sure we have good hygiene, we could write plus zero x, and I encourage you to actually always do this if you're writing out a polynomial so that you don't skip that place, so to speak, minus 108. And so then you say, all right, let's look at the highest degree terms. X goes into x to the third x squared times. X squared times six is six x squared. X squared times x is x to the third. We want to subtract. We've done this multiple times, so I'm going a little bit faster than normal. Those cancel out. Nine x squared minus six x squared is three x squared. Bring down that zero x. And then how many times does x go into three x squared? Well, it goes three x times, and we would write it in this column. And notice, if we didn't keep this column for our first degree terms, we'd be kind of confused where to write that three x right about now. And so three x plus, times six, I should say, is 18 x. Three x times x is three x squared. We want to subtract what we have in that, I guess that color is mauve, light purple, not sure. And so we get three x squareds cancel out, and then zero x minus 18 x is negative 18 x. Bring down that negative 108. And so then we have x goes into negative 18 x negative 18 times. Negative 18 times six is negative 108. That's working out nicely. Negative 18 times x is negative 18 x. And then we want to subtract what we have in this not-so-pleasant brown color, and so I will multiply them both by a negative. And so I am left with zero. Everything just cancels out. And so I can rewrite p of x. I can rewrite p of x as being equal to x plus six times x squared plus three x minus 18. But I'm not done yet because this is not a linear factor. This is still quadratic. So let's see, can I think of two numbers that add up to three and that when I multiply I get negative 18? So I'll need different signs, and then the obvious one is positive six and negative three. And if that, what I just did, seems like voodoo to you, I encourage you to review factoring polynomials. But this I can rewrite 'cause negative six plus, or actually I should say positive six plus negative three is equal to three, and then positive six times negative three is equal to negative 18. So I can rewrite this as x plus six times x plus six times x minus three. And so there we have it. We have a product of linear factors. And we are done.",math_math3_poly-div
" Let's say I have a path in the xy plane that's essentially the unit circle. So this is my y-axis, this is my x-axis, and our path is going to be the unit circle. And we're going to traverse it just like that. We're going to traverse it clockwise. I think you get the idea. And so its equation is the units circle. So the equation of this is x squared plus y squared is equal to 1; has a radius of 1 unit circle. And what we're concerned with is the line integral over this curve c. It's a closed curve c. It's actually going in that direction of 2y dx minus 3x dy. So, we are probably tempted to use Green's theorem and why not? So let's try. So this is our path. So Green's theorem tells us that the integral of some curve f dot dr over some path where f is equal to-- let me write it a little nit neater. Where f of x,y is equal to P of x, y i plus Q of x, y j. That this integral is equal to the double integral over the region-- this would be the region under question in this example. Over the region of the partial of Q with respect to x minus the partial of P with respect to y. All of that dA, the differential of area. And of course, the region is what I just showed you. Now, you may or may not remember-- well, there's a slight, subtle thing in this, which would give you the wrong answer. In the last video we said that Green's theorem applies when we're going counterclockwise. Notice, even on this little thing on the integral I made it go counterclockwise. In our example, the curve goes clockwise. The region is to our right. Green's theorem-- this applies when the region is to our left. So in this situation when the region is to our right and we're going-- so this is counterclockwise. So in our example, where we're going clockwise, the region is to our right, Green's theorem is going to be the negative of this. So in our example, we're going to have the integral of c and we're going to go in the clockwise direction. So maybe I'll draw it like that of f dot dr. This is going to be equal to the double integral over the region. You could just swap these two-- the partial of P with respect to y minus the partial of Q with respect to x da. So let's do that. So this is going to be equal to, in this example, the integral over the region-- let's just keep it abstract for now. We could start setting the boundaries, but let's just keep the region abstract. And what is the partial of P with respect-- let's remember, this right here is our-- I think we could recognize right now that if we take f dot dr we're going to get this. The dr contributes those components. The f contributes these two components. So this is P of x,y. And then this is Q of x,y. And we've seen it. I don't want to go into the whole dot dr and take the dot product over and over again. I think you can see that this is the dot product of two vectors. This is the x component of f, y component of f. This is the x component of dr, y component of dr. So let's take the partial of P with respect to y. You take the derivative of this with respect to y, you get 2. Derivative of 2y is just 2. So you get 2, and then, minus the derivative of Q with respect to x. Derivative of this with respect to x is minus 3. So we're going to get minus 3, and then all of that da. And this is equal to the integral over the region. What's this, it's 2 minus minus 3? That's the same thing as 2 plus 3. So it's the integral over the region of 5 dA. 5 is just a constant, so we can take it out of the integral. So this is going to turn out to be quite a simple problem. So this is going to be equal to 5 times the double integral over the region R dA. Now what is this thing? What is this thing right here? It looks very abstract, but we can solve this. This is just the area of the region. That's what that double integral represents. You just sum up all the little dA's. That's a dA, that's a dA. You sum up the infinite sums of those little dA's over the region. Well, what's the area of this unit circle? Here we just break out a little bit of ninth grade-- actually, even earlier than that-- pre-algebra or middle school geometry. Area is equal to pi r squared. What's our radius? So unit circle, our radius is 1. Length is 1. So the area here is pi. So this thing over here, that whole thing is just equal to pi. So the answer to our line integral is just 5 pi, which is pretty straightforward. I mean, we could have taken the trouble of setting up a double integral where we take the antiderivative with respect to y first and write y is equal to the negative square root of 1 minus x squared y is equal to the positive square root. x goes from minus 1 to 1. But that would have been super hairy and a huge pain. And we just have to realize, no, this is just the area. And the other interesting thing is I challenge you to solve the same integral without using Green's theorem. You know, after generating a parameterization for this curve, going in that direction, taking the derivatives of x of t and y of t. Multiplying by the appropriate thing and then taking the antiderivative-- way hairier than what we just did using Green's theorem to get 5 pi. And remember, the reason why it wasn't minus 5 pi here is because we're going in a clockwise direction. If we were going in a counterclockwise direction we could have applied the straight up Green's theorem, and we would have gotten minus 5 pi. Anyway, hopefully you found that useful.",math_multivariable-calculus_greens-theorem-and-stokes-theorem
" - We're to let a and b be rational numbers, and let b be non-zero, they have to say let b be non-zero because we're about to divide by b. Is a over b rational or irrational? Well let's think about it, they're both rational numbers so that means that a, since it's rational, can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, so I can write a is equal to m over n, and same thing about b, I could write b as being equal to p over q, where where m, n, p, and q are integers, are integers, by definition of what a rational number is, they're telling us these numbers are rational so I can express them as these types of ratios. So what is a over b going to be? a over b is going to be m over n over p over q which is equal to m over n, if I divide by a fraction, it's the same thing as multiplying by the reciprocal. q over p, let me write that a little bit, q over p which is equal to mq over np. Well mq is going to be an integer, if the product of two integers is going to be an integer, and np is going to be another integer, the product of two integers is an integer, so I've just shown that a over b can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, so a over b is for sure, in fact I've just proven it to you, a over b is for sure going to be rational. Let's do a few more of these, this is interesting. All right, so now we're saying let a and b be irrational numbers. Is a over b, let a and b be irrational numbers. Is a over b rational or irrational? And, like always, pause the video and try to think this through, and you might want do some examples of some irrational numbers and see if you can get, when you divide them, you can get rational or irrational numbers. Well, let's just imagine a world where, let's say, that a is equal to, I dunno, two square roots of two, and b is equal to the square root of two. Well, in that world, a over b, a over b would be two square roots of two over the square root of two which would be two, which is very much a rational number, I can express that as a ratio of integers, I can write that as two over one, there's actually an infinite number of ways I can express that as a ratio of two integers. So, in this case, I was able to get a over b to be rational, based on a and b being irrational. But, what if, what if instead of, what if a was equal to the square root of two and b is equal to the square root of, let's say, b is equal to the square root of seven. Well, then a over b would be equal to the square root of two over the square root of seven, which is still going to be irrational, I mean another way to think about it, and I'm not proving it here, but you could think about it, this is going to be the square root of two sevens, so we have something that's not a perfect square under the radical, so we're going to end up with an irrational number. So, we can show one example where a over b is rational and we showed one example where it is irrational, so it can be either way. Let's do a few more of these. All right, let a be a non-zero rational number. Is a times the square root of eight rational or irrational? Well, the key here is, if you multiply an irrational number and why is this an irrational number? It has a perfect square in it, but it's not a perfect square in and of itself. The square root of eight is, the square root of eight is equal to the square root of four times two, which is equal to the square root of four times the square root of two, which is equal to two square roots of two. And, this is kind of getting to the punchline of this problem, but if I multiply a rational times an irrational, I am going to get an irrational. So the square root of eight is an irrational, and if I multiply that times a rational number, I'm still going to get an irrational number. So this is going to be, for sure, irrational. Let's do one more of these. So we're to let a be an irrational number. Is negative 24 plus a rational or irrational? And I won't give a formal proof here, but to give you more of an intuitive feel, it's nice to just try out some numbers, and I encourage you to pause the video and try to think through it yourself. Let's just imagine some values, imagine if a is irrational, a is irrational, so what if a was equal to negative pi, which is approximately equal to negative three point one four one five nine and it keeps going on and on forever, never repeating. Well, then we would have negative 24 plus a would be equal to negative 24 minus pi, which would be approximately negative 27 point one for one five nine, the decimal expansion, everything to the right of the decimal, is going to be the exact same thing as pi. So this looks like, at least for this example, is going to be irrational, and let's see, if a was square root of two negative 24 plus the square root of two, well, once again, I'm not doing a proof here, but intuitively, this is going to be a decimal, it's going to have a decimal expansion that's going to go on forever and never repeat, and so this would just change what's to the left of the decimal, but not really change what's, well it would change what's to the right of the decimal because this is negative, but it's still going to go on forever and never repeat, and if, in fact, this was if this was this way, then to the right of the decimal, you would have the same thing as the square root of two to the left of the decimal, you would just have a different value, you would have negative 25 point whatever whatever whatever, and so this is, when you add a rational number to an irrational number, we've proven in other videos, a rational plus an irrational is going to be irrational, irrational. If you want that proof, we have other videos within this tutorial.",math_in-in-class-9-math-kv_in-in-8-kv-number-systems
" - One of the coolest and most important things that our bodies do is maintain this thing called Homeostasis. It's a regulation of the stable internal environment no matter where we are or what we're doing. After all, we put our bodies through a lot every single day, we're always adding food and liquid and chemicals. We're constantly changing temperature and our level's activities but our bodies can roll with it, it's like no big deal for them. All of our organ systems have some hand in maintaining homeostasis, I mean it's basically the thing that makes us not dead. But the excretory system AKA the urinary system, which includes the kidneys, the ureters, the bladder and the urethra is the star quarterback of the homeostasis team, that's because your excretory system is responsible for maintaining the right levels of water and dissolved substances in your body. This is called Osmoregulation and it's how our bodies get rid of the stuff we don't need like byproducts and metabolism food while also making sure that we don't get dehydrated. It's the body's greatest balancing act and your body is doing it right now ans all of the time as long as you're not dead. (upbeat music) As with other organ systems, we've talked about not all excretory systems in the animal kingdom are created equal. Different animals excrete wastes different ways based on their evolutionary history, what environments they live in, and what their hobbies and interests are, these factors all influence how an animal regulates water and most metabolic waste needs to be dissolved in water in order to be excreted. The problem is a main byproduct of metabolizing food is ammonia, which comes from breaking down proteins and it's pretty toxic so depending on how much water is available to an animal and how easy it is for the animal to lug a bunch of water around inside it. Animals convert this ammonia into either urea or uric acid. Mammals like us as well as amphibians and some marine animals like sharks and sea turtles convert ammonia into urea, a compound made from combining ammonia and carbon dioxide in their livers. The advantage of urea is its very low toxicity. It can hang out in your circulatory systems for a while with no ill effects but you have to have some extra water available to dissolve it and get rid of it. This isn't such a tall order, really. I mean peeing isn't a huge inconvenience. I mean is it, it's not for me anyway. Well, it would be though if you were a bird or an insect or a lizard living in the desert. Animals that have to be light enough to fly or don't have a bunch of spare water hanging around convert ammonia into uric acid, which can be excreted as kind of paste, so not a lot of water is needed. Using bird poop, if you haven't taken a close look, next time do that, just look. The white stuff in the bird droppings is actually the uric acid-y pee and the brown stuff is the poop. So now that we've established what is and what is not bird poop, let's get down to the brass tacks of how humans get all this urea out of our blood and into our toilets. The excretory system starts with the kidneys. The organs that do all the heavy lifting from maintaining those levels of water and dissolved materials in our bodies to controlling our blood pressure. And even though they do an amazing job I'm not bad-mouthing your kidneys here. The way that they do it is frankly a little bit janky and inefficient. They start out by filtering a bunch of fluid and the stuff dissolved in the fluid out of your blood, and then they basically reabsorb 99% of it back before sending that 1% on its way in the form of urine. Seriously, 99% gets reabsorbed. On an average day your kidneys filter out about 180 liters of fluid from your blood, but only 1.5 liters of that ends up getting peed out, so most of your excretory system is dedicated to excreting. It's dedicated to reabsorbing. But the system works obviously. I'm still alive, so we can't argue with that. And now it is time to get into the nitty-gritty details of how your kidneys do all of this and it's pretty cool. But there's lots of weird words, so get ready. Your kidneys do all this work using a network of tiny filtering structures called nephrons. Each one of your mango sized kidneys has about a million of them, if you were don't do this bit if you were to unravel all of your nephrons and put them end to end they would stretch over 80 kilometers. This is where all the crazy action happens. So to understand how they work, we're just gonna follow the flow from your heart to the toilet. Blood from the heart enters the kidneys through renal arteries and just so you know whenever you hear the word renal it means we're dealing with kidney stuff. As the blood enters, it's forced into a system of tiny capillaries until it enters a tangle of porous capillaries called the glomerulus, this is the starting point for a single nephron, the pressure in the glomerulus is high enough that it squeezes some of the fluid out of the blood. About 20% of it, and into a cup-like sack called the Bowman's capsule. The stuff that gets squeezed out is no longer blood, it is now called filtrate. It's made up of water, urea, some smaller ions and molecules like sodium, glucose and amino acids, the bigger stuff in your blood like red blood cells and the larger proteins they don't get filtered, now the filtrate is ready to be processed, from the Bowman's capsule it flows into a twisted tube called the proximal convoluted tubule which means the tube near the beginning and that is all windy, why are we so bad at naming things. Anyway, this is the first of two convoluted tubules in the nephron and these along with other tubules we're talking about are where the osmoregulation takes place. With all kinds of tricked out specialized pumps and other kinds of active and passive transport they reabsorb water and dissolve materials to create whatever balance your body needs at the time, and the proximal tubule, it's mainly organic solutes in the filtrate that are reabsorbed, like glucose and amino acids and other important stuff that you wanna hang on to. But it also helps to recapture some sodium and potassium and water that we're gonna want later. From here, the filtrate enters the loop of Henle, which is a long hair pin shapred tubule that passes through the two main layers of the kidney. The outermost layer is the renal cortex. That's where the glomerulus and the Bowman's capsule and both convoluted tubules are and the layer beneath that is the renal medulla which is the center of the kidney. Cortex, by the way, is Latin for tree bark so whenever you see it in biology know that it's the outside of something. Medulla on the other hand meaning marrow or pith so you know that it's the inside just to help you remember this stuff. But before we take a tour of this amazing loop, I have to do a couple of things. First, go pee, 'cause this is, you know. And second, a Biolo-graphy, so I'll be right back. (playful piano music) The loop of Henle was discovered by 19th century german physician and anatomist Friedrich Gustov Jakob Henle, and I'm pretty sure it was just one of those guys that you can't gross out 'cause he spent most of his career dissecting kidneys and eyeballs and brains and also seemed to be a huge fan of mucus and pus. He was by far the most important anatomist of his time, his three volume Handbook of Systematic Human Anatomy was recognized as the definitive anatomy textbook of its day and was famous for its exquisite attention to detail, and its intricate, even beautiful illustrations. Not only did Henle discover the loop of Henle arguably the lynch pin of kidney function in mammals. He was also an early adopter of the wildly unpopular germ theory of disease. His student, Robert Koch is considered to be one of the founders of microbiology and the two worked together to formulate the Henle-Koch Postulates, which today remain the four conditions that must be met to establish a causal relationship between a microbe and a disease. Henle taught the world so much about the human body that there are right no within you no fewer than nine features that bear has named. From the Henle's Fissures between the muscle fibers of your heart to the Crypts of Henle, which are microscopic pockets in the whites of your eyes. Also the name of my Cradle of Filth cover band. Alright, so review time, we've squeezed some filtrate out of the blood and reabsorbed some of the important organic molecules we wanna keep but most of the reabsorption action happens here in the Loop of Henle which does three really important things. One, it extracts most of the water that we need from the filtrate as it travels down to the medulla. Two, it pumps out the salts that we wanna keep on the way back to the cortex. And three, in the process of doing all that it makes the medulla hypertonic or super salty relative to the filtrate, creating a concentration gradient that will allow the medulla to draw out even more water one last time from the filtrate before the final journey to the toilet begins. It's complicated, and again kind of janky but it's what allows us mammals to create urine that's as concentrated as necessary using only the amount of water that our bodies can spare at the time. So first, filtrate starts going down the loop and the thing to know here is that the membrane is highly permeable to water, not so much to salt or anything else, mainly water. Now compare to the filtrate the tissue of the medulla is already pretty salty and as the filtrate processes, the surrounding tissue becomes increasingly hypertonic. The farther down you go the saltier it gets. So applying everything that we've learned about osmosis, you know that as the filtrate moves along it loses more and more water through the membrane, by the time the filtrate gets to the bottom of the loop it's highly concentrated, and now the filtrate enters the ascending end of the loop and here it's basically the same but in reverse. The membrane is not permeable to water and instead it's lined with channels that transport ions like sodium, potassium, and chlorine and because the filtrate is so concentrated now it's actually hypertonic compared to the fluid outside of the medulla. So as it ascends, huge amounts of salts start flowing out of the filtrate, which makes the renal medulla really really really salty. This salty medulla also creates a concentration gradient between the medulla and the filtrate which we're gonna need in the final step of pee making. But first, once the filtrate is back up in the cortex and out of the loop it enters the second of our convoluted tubules called the distal convoluted tubule or farther away curly tube, while the first tubule worked mostly in the reabsorbing of organic compounds in the filtrate, here the focus is on regulating levels of potassium, sodium, and calcium. This work is mainly done by pumps and hormones that regulate the reabsorption process. By the time it's done, we have finally taken everything we want to keep out of the filtrate, so now it's mainly just excess water, urea, and other metabolic waste. This stuff all gets dumped into collecting ducts 1that channel it back down to the center of the 1kidney, the medulla, and remember 1the medulla is super salty, right? 1Now more hormones kick in that tell the 1collecting ducts how porous to make their membranes. 1If the membranes are made very porous 1more water is absorbed into the medulla 1which makes the urine, yes, we can 1start calling it urine now, even more concentrated. 1And here's a fun fact, if you've 1ever had one drink too many, you might have 1noticed that you start to pee a lot 1and your pee is clear, that's because 1alcohol interferes with these hormones 1especially one called anti-diuretic hormone 1which tells the collecting ducts to be 1very porous so that you reabsorb most of the water. 1With those hormones all confused 1and out of commission you just start 1peeing out all kinds of water which 1also means you're getting dehydrated 1which means you're officially on a 1one way trip to hangover city so 1now you know why that happens. 1Now, at this point the urine leaves 1both kidneys and flows down to the 1urinary bladder by tubes called ureters. 1Once in the bladder, the urine just sits around 1waiting for us to decide when it's 1time to find a bathroom, and when that time comes 1the little sphincter muscle relaxes 1and releases the urine from the bladder 1into a tube called the urethra 1which empties out wherever you point it. 1So that's how your excretory system works 1and that's basically how it works for most mammals 1although some modifications are made 1based on again where they live and what they do. 1For instance, kangaroo rats, which are 1tiny and adorable and live in the desert 1have the most concentrated urine of 1any animal anywhere because it can't spare the water. 1So it has a very very long loop of Henle 1that reabsorbs most of the water from the filtrate. 1On the other end of the spectrum we have the beavers 1who have very short loops of Henle because 1they're like water reabsorption 1sh-mod-er re-ad-smorp-sion, do you see what I do all day? 1So now you know the true origins of pee.",science_biology_crash-course-bio-ecology
" -  So we have blank plus 261 is equal to 630, and I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can figure out what blank is. So there's a couple of ways to tackle this. Let's visualize it on a number line. So that's my number line right over there. And we could start at blank, or I'll call that question mark. So we could start at question mark, and if we add 261 to it, so if we add 261, plus 261, we can get to 630. We can get to 630. That's the 630 right over there, which means that if we started at 630, if we start at 630, and we were to subtract 261, if we were to go the other way, if we were to subtract 261, so let's do that. So, minus 261. Minus 261. We're gonna get back to blank. We're gonna get back to our question mark. Now there's a bunch of ways that you can compute this, but I'm gonna try to tackle it in a way that I would actually try to do it in my head, or it'll simply my computation, it's just one of many ways to figure this out. So the way I would do it is I would first subtract 200, so I would first subtract 200. So that's about, I'm not drawing it perfectly to scale. So I would subtract 200, so that's minus 200 right over there, which would get me to 430. I could do that in my head. I just subtracted two hundreds from that. And let's see, now I wanna subtract 60. So then I would subtract 60. So minus 60. Let's see, 430 minus 60. That's 43 10s minus six 10s. Well, that's gonna be 37 10s, or 370. This gets us to 370. And then we going to subtract one more. We have to subtract 260 and then we subtract one. So 370 minus one is 369. So this right over here is 360, 369. Now, another way we could have done it is we could have swapped the order. We could have said if blank plus 261 is 630, we could have said 261 plus blank is equal to 630. All I did is I swapped the order here, but we could visualize that as a different thing on the number line. So I'm going to, let me draw my number line again. So there's my number line. And I could start at 261. So this time I'm starting at 261. 261. And I wanna get to 630. And I wanna get to 630, and the amount that I add is going to be the blank. So let's see what I have to add to get to 630. And I'm gonna add numbers that are easy for me to compute. So I could add nine, I could add nine. Now, why did I add nine? Because that gets me to 270, which is a nice, round number. And then I could add, let's see, I could 30 here to get to 300, so let me do that. So plus 30. I'm not doing this quite to scale, but this is going to get me to 300. And then from 300 to 630, well I could just add 330. I could just add 330 there. So how much did I add in total? This is 39 plus 330. That's 369. I added 369. So these are all ways of getting to the same value, all ways of viewing the same problem.",math_in-in-class-3rd-math-cbse_imp-addition-and-subtraction
" Let's say that I have a ramp made of ice. Looks like maybe a wedge or some type of an inclined plane made of ice. And we'll make everything of ice in this video so that we have negligible friction. So this right here is my ramp. It's made of ice. And this angle right over here, let's just go with 30 degrees. And let's say on this ramp made of ice, I have another block of ice. So this is a block of ice. It is a block of ice, it's shiny like ice is shiny. And it has a mass of 10 kilograms. And what I want to do is think about what's going to happen to this block of ice. So first of all, what are the forces that we know are acting on it? Well if we're assuming we're on Earth, and we will, and we're near the surface, then there is the force of gravity. There's the force of gravity acting on this block of ice. And the force of gravity is going to be equal to-- it's going to be in the downward direction, and its magnitude is going to be the mass of the block of ice times the gravitational field times 9.8 meters per second squared. So it's going to be 98 newtons downward. So this is 98 newtons downward. I just took 10 kilograms. Let me write it out. So the force due to gravity is going to be equal to 10 kilograms times 9.8 meters per second squared downward. This 9.8 meters per second squared downward, that is the field vector for the gravitational field of the surface of the earth, I guess is one way to think about it. Sometimes you'll see the negative 9.8 meters per second squared. And then that negative is giving you the direction implicitly because the convention is normally that positive is upward and negative is downward. We'll just go with this right over here. So the magnitude of this vector is 10 times 9.8, which is 98 kilogram meters per second squared, which is the same thing as newtons. So the magnitude here is 98 newtons and it is pointing downwards. Now what we want to do is break this vector up into the components that are perpendicular and parallel to the surface of this ramp. So let's do that. So first, let's think about perpendicular to the surface of the ramp. So perpendicular to the surface of the ramp. So this right over here is a right angle. And we saw in the last video, that whatever angle this over here is, that is also going to be this angle over here. So this angle over here is also going to be a 30-degree angle. And we can use that information to figure out the magnitude of this orange vector right over here. And remember, this orange vector is the component of the force of gravity that is perpendicular to the plane. And then there's going to be some component that is parallel to the plane. I'll draw that in yellow. Some component of the force of gravity that is parallel to the plane. And clearly this is a right angle, because this is perpendicular to the plane. And this is parallel to the plane. If it's perpendicular to the plane, it's also perpendicular to this vector right over here. So we can use some basic trigonometry, like we did in the last video, to figure out the magnitude of this orange and this yellow vector right over here. This orange vector's magnitude over the hypotenuse is going to be equal to the cosine of 30. Or you could say that the magnitude of this is 98 times the cosine of 30 degrees newtons. 98 times the cosine of 30 degrees newtons. And if you want the whole vector, it's in this direction. And the direction going into the surface of the plane. And, based on the simple trigonometry-- and we go into this in a little bit more detail in the last video-- we know that the component of this vector that is parallel to the surface of this plane is going to be 98 sine of 30 degrees. Sine of 30 degrees. Sine of 30 degrees. And this comes straight out of this magnitude, which is opposite to the angle over the hypotenuse. Opposite over hypotenuse is equal to sine of an angle. And we did all the work over here. I don't want to keep repeating it. But I always want to emphasize that this is coming straight out of basic trigonometry, straight out of basic trigonometry. So once you do that, we know the different components. We can calculate them. Cosine of 30 degrees is square root of 3 over 2. Sine of 30 degrees is 1/2. That's just one of those things that you learn and you can derive it yourself using 30-60-90 triangles, or actually even equilateral triangles. Or you could use a calculator. But it's also one of those things that you memorize when you take trigonometry. So no kind of magical trick I did here. And so if you evaluate this, 98 times the square root of 3 over 2 newtons, tells us that-- let me write it in that same orange color-- the force, the component of gravity that is perpendicular to the plane. And this kind of implicitly gives us this direction, it's perpendicular to the plane. But the force component of gravity that's perpendicular to the plane is equal to 98 times square root of 3 over 2. 98 divided by 2 is 49. So it's equal to 49 times the square root of 3 newtons. And its direction is into the surface of the plane, or downward or, let me just write, into surface of plane. Surface of the plane, or the surface of the ramp. And it's in this direction over here. And I have to do this because it's a vector. I have to tell you what direction it's going in. And the component of the force of gravity that is parallel. The component of the force of gravity that is parallel, I drew it down here, but I could shift it up over here. It's the same exact vector. The component of gravity that is parallel to the surface of the plane is 98 times sine of 30. That's 98 times 1/2, which is 49 newtons. And it's going in that direction, or parallel to the surface of the plane. Parallel, I always have trouble spelling parallel. Parallel to-- don't even know if I spelled it right-- surface of the plane. So what's going to happen here? Well, if these were the only forces acting on it. So if we had a net force going into the surface of the plane of 49 square roots of 3 newtons. If this was the only force acting in this dimension or in the dimension that is perpendicular to the surface of the plane, what would happen? Well, then the block would just accelerate. At least just due to this force it would accelerate downward. It would accelerate into the surface of the plane. But we know it's not going to accelerate. We know that there's this big wedge of ice here that is keeping it from accelerating in that direction. So at least in this dimension, there will be no acceleration. When I talk about this dimension, I'm talking about in the direction that is perpendicular to the surface of the plane. There will be no acceleration because this wedge is here. So the wedge is exerting a force that completely counteracts the force, the perpendicular component of gravity. And that force. You might guess what it's called. So the wedge is exerting a force, just like that, that's going to be 98 newtons upward. The wedge is going to be exerting a force that is 49 square roots of 3, because this right here is 49 square roots of 3 newtons into. And so this is 49 square roots of 3 newtons out of the surface, out of the surface. And this is the normal force. It is the force perpendicular to the surface that essentially, you could kind of view as the contact force that the, in this case, that the surface is exerting to keep this block of ice from accelerating in that direction. We're not talking about accelerating straight towards the center of the earth. We're talking about accelerating in that direction. We broke up the force into kind of the perpendicular direction and the parallel direction. So you have this counteracting normal force. And that's why you don't have the block plummeting or accelerating into the plane. Now what other forces do we have? Well, we have the force that's parallel to the surface. And if we assume that there's no friction-- and I can assume that there's no friction in this video because we are assuming that it is ice on ice-- what is going to happen? There's no counteracting force to this 49 newtons. 49 newtons parallel downwards, I should say parallel downwards, to the surface of the plane. So what's going to happen? Well, it's going to accelerate in that direction. You have force is equal to mass times acceleration. Force is equal to mass times acceleration. Or you divide both sides by mass, you get force over mass is equal to acceleration. Over here, our force is 49 newtons in that direction, parallel downwards to the surface of the plane. And so if you divide both by mass, if you divide both of these by mass. So that's the same thing as dividing it by 10 kilograms, dividing by 10 kilograms, that will give you acceleration. That will give you our acceleration. So acceleration is 49 newtons divided by 10 kilograms in that direction, in this direction right over there. And 49 divided by 10 is 4.9, and then newtons divided by kilograms is meters per second squared. So then you get your acceleration. Your acceleration is going to be 4.9 meters per second squared. 1And maybe I could say parallel. 1That's two bars. 1Or maybe I'll write parallel. 1Parallel downwards to the surface. 1Now I'm going to leave you there, 1and I'll let you think about another thing 1that I'll address in the next video is, 1what if you had this just standing still? 1If it wasn't accelerating downwards, 1if it wasn't accelerating and sliding down, 1what would be the force that's keeping it 1in a kind of a static state? 1We'll think about that in the next video.",science_physics_forces-newtons-laws
" So we're going to talk about the left ventricle. I'm going to draw out the left ventricle here. And I'm going to draw out the rest of the heart, as well, but I'm just going to kind of leave dashes here just to make sure that we kind of focus in on just that one chamber, the left ventricle. And this is, of course, next to the right ventricle. And above both of them, you know you have the two atria. Right? These are the chambers of the heart that are going to kind of hold onto the blood until it's time to refill the ventricles. This is our right atrium and our left atrium. Now a question that came up to me, and might come up to you, is why in the world does the left ventricle never have a rip or tear? I mean, if I look at my jeans or anything else, you always get these kind of rips and tears over time. And why is it that you don't get these tears in the left ventricle? I mean it would be disastrous, of course, because the blood would start gushing out of the left ventricle, but what prevents that from happening? And also what are the stresses on the left ventricle? What does it have to deal with exactly? So to think about this, I actually wanted to split it up into two categories. You've got diastole, right? And you've got systole. And diastole, of course, is when you have refilling of the heart and systole is during kind of the squeezing of the heart. And when I say the heart, I should really be more specific. I mean the squeezing of the left ventricle. Because now I'm going to talk just in the perspective of the left ventricle. Now diastole, what is happening there? Well, blood is really refilling that left ventricle and so the volume of that chamber is going up, up, up. And during systole, pressure is going up, up, up. So these are the two major issues, right? Now of course you have volume in systole and, of course, you have some pressure in diastole. That's not what I'm saying. But what I am trying to get to is the idea that the major issue in diastole is the fact that you've got a full heart. Especially by the end of diastole, and you should have a full left ventricle, the fullest it's going to be. And in systole, the highest pressures that the left ventricle is going to see. So keeping this idea in mind, let's actually now go back about 200 years to someone who thought about a very similar situation around kind of the stress of the wall, and what pressure and volume will do to that. So this guy, I'm going to draw up his picture, bring it up. This guy is a French mathematician. And his name was Laplace. And we actually still honor him by kind of talking about his formulas today. And Laplace was a brilliant mathematician. He actually gave a lot of thought to shapes. And the shape that we're going to be kind of focusing on today is the sphere, or a ball. So you can just think of a ball like a baseball. I'm drawing it kind of orange like a basketball, I suppose. And this ball is essentially a hollow sphere, right? And I'm going to draw on the side-- actually, I'm going to write that sphere here-- I'm going to draw on the side a left ventricle. Or kind of my image of a left ventricle, right? Something like that. It actually starts looking quite similar to this sphere. So the idea is that he, Laplace, thought about spheres, but a lot of the ideas he put forward actually apply beautifully to the left ventricle, as well. So you've got something like this, where you can see the obvious similarities. Now Laplace thought about this in terms of what would happen if you actually cut away part of that sphere? And let's say you could actually now kind of look down at the cross section of it. Something like that. So he actually thought about it in those terms. And, of course, I said that this is a hollow ball, so you've got to fill it in. You've got something like an inner circle I suppose. Like that, right? In fact, let me draw it on the side here so you can make it really nice and easy to see. I don't want you to have to try to figure out what it is I'm drawing. Something like that, right? This is our cross section of the ball or the sphere. And you could do the exact same thing with the left ventricle. Now the first thing that Laplace thought about was volume. He knew that volume is going to put some sort of stress on the wall. And volume, we know equals-- you can actually write the formula out-- 4/3 pi r cubed. So if you actually take away some of these numbers, 4/3 and pi, I mean these are just numbers. Right? You can get rid of those. Then you could say, well, there's a relationship or a proportion between volume and radius. And you can actually write proportion as this symbol, right? That means proportional to. And so you can take the cubed root of both sides. You could just say, OK, what's the cubed root of this side? And the cubed root of this side? And you could say, well, that means that radius-- because that cancels-- radius is proportional to the cubed root of v, or volume. And on our two pictures, let me just write it on this picture, actually, just to be clear. This would be our radius. So this is our radius. Now a second point, I'm just going to first label our picture, and then you'll see how it all kind of comes together, is pressure. And pressure is a little simpler to imagine. We know that that's just a force divided by an area. And here I can draw little blue arrows to signify the pressure on the walls of this left ventricle. This is our pressure. I say left ventricle or sphere. Kind of interchangeably, I guess, right? At the moment. And third is the wall itself. Right? The wall thickness. How thick is the wall? And that's obviously going to affect how much stress the wall feels. So wall thickness would be kind of this quantity. And I'll write w for wall thickness. Now putting it all together, Laplace came up with this. He said, well, the stress of the wall, we'll call it wall stress, is equal to some of these other factors. He said, it's equal to pressure-- let me write that first-- pressure times the radius divided by 2 times the wall thickness. 2 times w. So that was the relationship. And if you think about it, you get some interesting kind of ideas from this. You say, well, OK, radius, what is that? Well, radius is like a length, right? You're going to measure that out, like centimeters or millimeters. And wall thickness is also a length. Right? So you've got very similar. You've got millimeters or centimeters. And we just got through saying pressure is just force divided by an area. So what units are wall stress? Well, length cancels length. So all you're left with is force over area. So really, wall stress-- and this is pretty cool-- is in units of pressure. So it's kind of a pressure, isn't it? But that might make you feel kind of puzzled. Because you think, well, wait a second. What is wall stress exactly? You might have thought that wall stress was the stress on a wall. Maybe it was something like this. But actually, it's not, right? Because that would then just be the p, the pressure that we had in the first place. So then what is wall stress? What would it look like? Well, wall stress you can imagine as this. The stress is the-- we said it's a pressure. Think of the pressure, the pulling pressure. That's kind of how I think of it. Pulling pressure. Literally, the pressure that's pulling apart the wall. So, in our first question, when I opened up the video, I said, what is keeping our wall from just having rips and tears? And the wall stress is literally the force-- or I shouldn't say force-- the force divided by area, the pressure that's going to cause those rips and tears. So you can see that, in a way, we should have some rips and tears in our left ventricular wall. But we don't. Why don't we? So these, in that little white box, I'm going to draw for you what's inside there. And you know it's going to be little heart cells. Right? So little heart cells are lining this wall. And you've got thousands of them, of course, right? Thousands of little heart cells going every which way. And you've got them crossing and going over and under each other. Something like this. So what happens is that you literally have thousands of heart cells and they're attached to each other. And these little attachments are-- I'm going to draw on white-- called desmosomes. So desmosomes are one of the reasons why your heart doesn't just rip apart. You've got these tiny little desmosomes and their job is to keep everything kind of tidy and tucked. They want to keep the heart cells attached. And that means if they're going to be attached that they're not getting ripped apart. So these white little arrows are literally counteracting those purple pulling pressure arrows. So this is how you can think about wall stress and why it is that our heart doesn't just rip apart. Lastly, I want to point out that the pressure is actually going to be in our equation, but we don't really have volume in our equation, we have radius. And the relationship is a cubed root, right? So if you have a cubed root here, but pressure is direct, then that means that between the two of them, volume versus pressure, pressure has a bigger influence 1on wall stress than volume does. 1So that's one interesting point. 1Another interesting point is that wall thickness, which 1is right here, makes perfect sense. 1Because if you have more and more of these heart cells, 1that means you have more and more desmosomes that 1are going to counteract the effects of pressure and radius 1in this equation.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system
" -  Part b, write the first four, write the first nonzero terms of the Maclaurin series for f prime, the derivative of f. Express f prime as a rational function for the absolute value of x being less than R, our radius of convergence. So, if we wanna find f prime, we could just take each of, we could just take the derivative of each of these terms with respect to x. And so, we could just say, if this is f, then f prime, and I'm not gonna scroll down just so I can see this up here. We could just say f prime, f prime of x is going to be, or the Maclaurin series for f prime of x, maybe I should write it that way, so let me write it this way. Maclaurin, Maclaurin, Maclaurin, that a looked funny, Maclaurin series for f prime, f prime of x, well, it's going to be the sum from n equals one to infinity, and we would just take the derivative of this right over here with respect to x. And so, this is just application of the power rule. Take the exponent right over here, multiply it by the coefficient, so if you take n times this, it cancels out with this n, so it's going to be negative three to the n minus one, and then decrement your exponent, times x to the n minus one. And so, they want us to write the first four nonzero terms of the Maclaurin series, so that is going to be equal to, so, I'll write approximately equal to, because we're one going to write the first four of terms of this infinite series, and just to be clear what I did, I just did the power rule here, I looked at this exponent, which is n, multiplied by this coefficient, which had a n in the denominator, so that n and this n cancel out, so I'm just left with negative three to the n minus one, and then I decrement that exponent. That's straight out of the power rule, it's one of the first things you'll learn about taking derivatives. And so, if we want the first four nonzero terms, when n equals one this is going to be negative three to the one minus one power, let me just write it, negative three to the one minus one times x to the one minus one, that's when n equals one, plus negative three, negative three to the two minus one, two minus one, times x to the two minus one, and then, and actually I could've reassured this is negative three x to the n minus one, actually let me me do that just for, so this is, this I could just write, because they have the same exponent, this will simplify a little bit, as negative three x to the n minus one, and so this going to be approximately, when n is equal to one, this is gonna be equal to zero, so negative three x to the zero power is just gonna be one, when n is equal to two, this is going to be two minus one, so it's gonna be the first power, so negative three x to the first power, so I could just write this as negative three x, and then when n is three, well, this is going to be negative three x squared, so negative three x squared is going to be, negative three squared is nine x squared, and then the fourth term is gonna be negative three x to the four minus one power, so to the third power, so negative three to the third power is negative 27 times x to the third power. So there you have it, that's the first four nonzero terms of the Maclaurin series. You could've also just looked over here, and said okay, the derivative of x, with respect to x is one, derivative of negative three have x squared, with respect to x is negative three, you could've said, the derivative of this is nine x squared, right over there, and then you'd have to write out the fourth term and take out the derivative in the same way, and you'd have gotten this right over here. So we did the first part, we wrote the first four nonzero terms of the Maclaurin series for f prime, the derivative of f, and then they said, express f prime as a rational function for the absolute value of x being less than R. So this sum, if we assume it converges, and we know the radius of convergence already, so, or assuming that we're dealing with x that are withing the radius of convergence. So this right over here, you might recognize this, so I could write it like that, or I could also write it, if I start at n equals zero, so I could also write this as from n equals one to infinity of, or actually, from n equals zero to infinity of negative three x to the n minus one, either, I'm sorry, to the n, because now the first term was to the zero power, that first term was to zero power, so whether you do one minus one, is where you start, or you just at zero, these two things are equivalent. You might recognize these as a geometrix series with common ration of negative, of negative three x. And so, what's the sum of a geometric series with common ration, with a certain common ration? Well, it's going to be equal to the first term, and regardless of how you view this, the first term is going to be one divided by one minus the common ratio. So our common ratio is negative three x, one minus negative three x, well, that's just going to be one plus three x. If what I just did here looks unfamiliar to you, I encourage you to watch the sum of infinite geometric series, and not only do we show you this formula and how to apply it, but we show how you can prove this formula, it's actually a pretty fun prove. But anyway, regardless of how you view this Maclaurin series, it is an infinite geometric series, and this assuming that our x is in our radius of convergence. This is what our sum is, this is what we are going to converge to.",math_calculus-all-old_ap-calc-topic
" Well the whole premise of the last series of videos was really just trying to get at trying to figure out whether some transformation T-- let's have some transformation that is a mapping from, let's say it's a mapping from Rn to Rm, --the whole question is, is T invertible. And we showed several videos ago that a function, and a transformation is really just a function, that a function is invertible if it meets two conditions. So invertible. So I don't have to keep writing the word over again. You have to have two conditions. It has to be onto or essentially it has to map to every member of your codomain and it also has to be one-to-one. Another way of saying one-to-one is that every member of your codomain is mapped to by at most one member of your domain. And we did several videos where we thought well if we had a transformation, a linear transformation, that's defined by a matrix, A, where this would be an m-by-n matrix, we said that this is going to be met if the rank-- This is only met if the rank of A is equal to the number of rows in your transformation matrix is equal to m. And in the last video I just showed that this is only true if every one of your column vectors are linearly independent or that they all are basis vectors for your column space or that the rank of your matrix it has to be equal to n. Now in order for something to be invertible, in order for the transformation to be invertible, both of these things have to be true. Your rank of A has to be equal to m and your rank of A has to be equal to n. So in order to be invertible, a couple of things have to happen. In order to be invertible your rank of your transformation matrix has to be equal to m, which has to be equal to n. So m has to be equal to n. So we have an interesting condition. You have to have a square matrix. Your matrix has to be n-by-n. That's what this implies. If both of these are true, then m has to be equal n and you're dealing with a square matrix. Even more, you're dealing with the square matrix where every one of the columns are linearly independent, so this is our A. A looks like this. A1, A2, all the way to An. Since the rank of A is equal to n, and this is of course an n-by-n matrix. We just said that this has to be the case because its rank has to be equal to m, which is the number of rows, and its rank has to be equal to n, which is the number of columns, so the rows and columns have to be the same. But the fact that your rank is equal to the number of columns, that means that all of your column vectors are bases for your column space, or that if you put them into reduced row echelon form, what are you going to get? Well all of these guys are basis vectors so they're all going to be associated with pivot vectors or they're all going to be associated with pivot columns. So this is going to be 1, 0, bunch of 0's, and then you're going to have a 0, 1, a bunch of 0's like this. They're all going to be associated with pivot columns when you go into reduced row echelon form. So all of them are pivot columns. It's an n-by-n matrix. So what is an n-by-n matrix where every column is a pivot column? What is an n-by-n matrix? Let me write this. So you have an n. So the reduced row echelon form of A has to be equal to an n-by-n matrix, cause A is n-by-n, where every column is a linearly independent pivot column. And I mean by definition of reduced row echelon form you can't have the same pivot column twice where every column is a linearly independent pivot column. It's a little bit redundant, but I think you get the idea. So what is an n-by-n matrix where every column is a linearly independent pivot column? Well that is just a matrix that has 1's down the diagonal and everything else is a 0. Or, you've seen this matrix before, this is just an n-by-n identity matrix or the identity matrix on n or on Rn. So if you multiply this matrix times any member of Rn, you're just going to get that matrix again. But this is interesting. We now have a pretty usable condition for invertibility. We can say that the transformation T that is a mapping from Rn to-- well it has to map to the same dimension space so from Rn to Rn. It's equal to some square matrix n-by-n, it has to be an n-by-n matrix, times our vectors in our domain. And it's only going to be invertible if the reduced row echelon form of our transformation matrix is equal to the identity matrix on n. I mean I could have written an m here and I could've said this is an m-by-n matrix, but the only way that this is going to be true is if this is also an n and this is also an m. But maybe I could leave them there. Let me leave those m's there because that's the big takeaway. The big takeaway is that in order for the transformation matrix to be invertible, the only way it's invertible is if the reduced row echelon form of our transformation matrix is equal to an n-by-n identity matrix. The identity matrix is always going to be n-by-n. So that's a big takeaway. Now we'll use that in the future to actually solve for transformations or solve for inverses of transformations.",math_linear-algebra_matrix-transformations
" -  So this could very well be an exciting video because we start with this idea of a Fourier series that we could take a periodic function and represent it as an infinite sum of weighted cosines and sines and we use that idea to say, ""Well can we find formulas ""for those coefficients?"" And we were able to do that using the powers of calculus. And now we can actually apply it for this particular square wave. And I picked a square wave that has a period of two pi and that's where, actually, a lot of these two pis came out from, and that's also why we started here at cosine t and sine of t. They both have a frequency of one over two pi, which is the frequency of our original square wave. And then the other terms have frequencies that are multiples of that. If we had a different period then all of that would change. But I picked this period to just make the math a little bit simpler and we will generalize in the future. But now, let's actually evaluate a-sub-zero, a-sub-n, and b-sub-n for this particular square wave. So, they key to realize is that our square wave between zero and pi, 'cause we're gonna keep taking the definite integral from zero to two pi, from zero to two pi, from zero to two pi. The key realization here is from zero to pi our function is equal to three, and from pi to two pi, our function is equal to zero. So all of these definite integrals. So this definite integral, for example, is going to be the same thing as, and I'll do it once and then we'll see that trend. This is the same thing as one over two pi times the definite integral from zero to pi of f-of-t dt plus the integral from pi to two pi of f-of-t dt. Now f-of-t, between zero and pi, we just said it's equal to three. And f-of-t between pi and two pi, well it's going to be equal to zero. And that's actually the case for these other situations. That f-of-t's gonna be zero from pi to two pi and zero times anything is gonna be zero, so the integrals, the definite integrals over this, the second part of the interval, are always going to be zero. And so it boils down to this. And so what's the definite integral from zero to pi of three dt? Well this is going to be equal to one over two pi times, so if you evaluate this, the anti-derivative of three, it'd be three t, evaluated from zero to pi, and so it'd be three pi minus three times zero which is just three pi. So it's equal to three pi over the two pi that we had already, over the two pi, and so this is going to be equal to three halves. Three halves. And that makes a lot of sense because a-sub-zero we said you could view that as the average value of the function over that interval. And the average value of that function is indeed, if it's three half the time, and zero the other half of the time, well then the average is going to be one and a half, or three halves. So that is our a-sub-zero. So now let's figure out the general a-sub-n where n is not equal zero. So, a-sub-n, well we are just gonna take, it's gonna be one over pi, one over pi, the definite integral, I could go from zero to two pi, but instead I'm just gonna cut to the chase. I'm gonna go just from zero to pi 'cause the integral from pi to two pi is just gonna be zero 'cause the function's equal to zero. It's gonna be zero times cosine nt; it's just gonna be zero. So for this particular square wave, I can just worry about from zero to pi. From zero to pi, f-of-t is three. So it's gonna be three cosine-nt. Three, let me do that color, three cosine-of-nt, cosine-nt dt. Now what is this going to be equal to? Well we can do a few things. We could take our three and bring it out front. So let me do that. So we could take that three and bring it out front. So, just putting the three out here. So take that three, put it out front. And we know that the derivative of sine-of-nt is n cosine-of-nt. So let's multiple the inside and the out, or let's multiple the inside by n, and then we could also divide by n but we could put that outside. They would, it'd be, n divided by n, we haven't changed the value. And so this is going to be equal to three over n pi, that's just what we had out here, times, well the anti-derivative of this business is going to be sine-of-nt, sine-of-nt. And we're gonna evaluate from zero to pi. So this is going to be equal to three over n pi times sine-of-n pi, well that's gonna be zero for any n, minus sine-of-zero times n. Well that's gonna be zero for any n. So all of this is just going to be zero. So a-sub-n is going to be equal to zero. The coefficient on any, for any, of a-sub-ns for any n not equal zero, it's going to be zero. So actually we're not gonna have any of these cosines show up in the Fourier expansion. Let's think about our b-sub-n. When you look at the shape of the square wave, it actually makes a lot of sense. But let's now tackle our b-sub-ns. So our b-sub-ns, get a little space here. So b-sub-n. Same thing, we could just worry about the interval from zero to pi because from pi to two pi our f-of-t is going to be equal to zero. So this is going to be equal to one over pi times the definite integral, once again I'm only gonna worry about from zero to pi, zero to pi dt. Now the value of the function from zero to pi is three, we've seen that before, I could put it here, but just to get a little bit simpler, let's just stick it right over here. Just gonna be three, actually I don't wanna skip too many steps. It's gonna be three times sine-of-nt. Three sine-of-nt. Now let's see. How can I reconstruct this so it's easy to take the anti-derivative? Well this is going to be, we take that three out front, it's gonna be three over pi. And then you have your definite integral from zero to pi of sine-of, we'll do that same color, sine-of-nt. Sine-of-nt dt. And we know the derivative of cosine-nt is negative n sine-of-nt, so let's throw a negative n in here. So negative n. Let's also divide by negative n. Just like that. If you have negative n divided by negative n, we haven't changed the value. That's just one. And so this is going to be equal to negative three over n pi times, we're going to take the anti-derivative here, so this is gonna be cosine-of-nt evaluated from zero zero to pi. And so, what is this? This is going to be equal to, this is equal to negative three over n pi. Cosine-of-zero n, that's gonna be one for any n, minus cosine-of Oh sorry. Why did I start at zero? It's gonna be cosine-of-n pi, cosine-of-n pi minus cosine-of-n times zero. So minus cosine-of-zero, cosine-of-zero is just gonna be one for any n. And so there you have it. We have a general And you might say, ""Well, cosine-of-n pi, ""is that positive one, or is that negative one?"" Well, it depends. If n is, if n is even, this is going to be positive one. If n is odd, this is going to be negative one. So it depends. And actually let's just write that out. So b-sub-n, b-sub-n is equal to, let's write those two cases. So if n is if n is even, and, another one, if n is odd. So if n is even, you're gonna have negative three over n pi times Actually let me just do it over here so we have the space. So what would this thing evaluate to if n is even? So this n, if it's even it'd be like cosine-of-two pi, cosine-of-four pi, cosine-of-six pi. Well in that situation, this is going to evaluate to one. You're gonna have one minus one, which is zero, so the whole thing is gonna evaluate to zero. And if n is odd, cosine-of-pi, cosine-of-three pi, cosine-of-five pi, well those are gonna evaluate to negative one. Then it's gonna be negative one if n is odd. Negative one minus one is negative two, and so this is all gonna be negative two. Negative two times negative three over n pi is going to be six. Six over n pi. So there you have it. We have been able to figure out our Fourier expansion. It is going to be, our square wave, and we definitely deserve a drumroll, this is many videos in the making, f-of-t is going to be equal to a-sub-zero, we figured out in this video is equal to three halves. So it's gonna be three halves. Let me write this. Well I'm just write it all in yellow. So three halves. Now we don't have any a-sub-ns. We figured that out. All of the a-sub-ns are going to be zero. And then the b, the only b-sub-ns we have is when n is odd. When n is odd. So, we're gonna have b-sub-one. So that's gonna be six over one pi. Six over one pi. Sine-of-one times t. So sine-of-t. Plus, now we're not gonna have a b-sub-two, we're gonna have a b-sub-three. So six over three pi times sine-of-three t, and of course this is the same thing as, 1this is the same thing as two over pi times sine of three t, 1plus, now we're not gonna have a b-sub-four, 1we're gonna have a b-sub-five. 1So that's going to be 1six over five pi. 1Actually I liked writing, 1it's nicer to actually not simplify here 1because you can see the pattern. 1So it's gonna be plus six over five pi 1times sine-of-five t. 1And we're just gonna go on and on and on. 1And there you have it. 1We have our Fourier expansion. 1In the next video, we're actually going to visualize this.",science_electrical-engineering_ee-signals
" Cosine of two theta is equal to C and theta is between zero and pi. Write a formula for sine of theta in terms of C and so I encourage you to pause the video and try to figure this out on your own before I work through it. So assuming you had a go, so let's see if we can work through it together. I'm going to get my scratchpad out, I have copied and pasted the exact question right over here, and so let's think about it. They're telling us that cosine of two theta is equal to C, so let me write it this way. C is equal to cosine of two theta. Now, using my knowledge of angle addition formulas, we know for example that cosine of alpha plus beta is equal to cosine alpha cosine beta minus sine alpha sine beta. Now why would this be useful here? Well this is the sum of just theta plus theta, and so I can rewrite this in terms of cosines and sines and maybe I can rewrite the cosines in terms of sines and then solve for the sines. So let's try to do that. So I can rewrite cosine of two theta that's the same as cosine of theta plus theta, is of course the same thing as two theta, and I can use the angle addition formula for cosine. This is going to be equal to cosine of theta, times cosine of theta, times cosine of theta, minus sine of theta, times sine of theta, time sine of theta, which is of course equal to cosine squared theta, that's equal to cosine squared theta, minus and what we have right over here is sine squared theta. So let's see, we've been able to rewrite C in terms of cosine squared theta and sine squared theta, but ideally we just want to write it in terms of sine theta so we can solve for sine theta. So if we can re-express cosine theta in terms of sine. Well we already know from the pythagorean identity that cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta is equal to one, or we could say that cosine squared theta is equal to, I'm just going to subtract sine squared from both sides, is equal to one minus sine squared theta. So let me rewrite this as one minus sine squared theta, and then of course we have minus this yellow sine squared theta, and all of this is equal to C or we could get that C is equal to one minus two sine squared theta. And what's useful about this is we just have to solve for sine of theta. So let's see, I could multiply both sides by a negative just so I can switch the order over here. So I could write this as negative C is equal to two sine squared theta minus one and just multiply both sides by a negative and then let's see I could add one to both sides, if I add one to both sides, and I'll go over here, if I add one to both sides, I get one minus C is equal to two sine squared theta, I could divide both sides by two, and then so I get sine squared theta is equal to one minus C over two, or I could write that sine of theta is equal to the plus or minus square root of one minus C over two. So that leads to a question, Is it both? Is it the plus and minus square root? Or is it just one of those? And I encourage you to pause the video again in case you haven't already figured it out, and look at the information here, and think about whether they give us the information of whether we should be looking at the positive or negative sine. Well they tell us that theta is between zero and pi. So if I were to draw a unit circle here, between zero and pi radians. So, this angle right over here is zero radians, and pi is going all the way over here. So this angle places its terminal ray either in the first or second quadrants. So, it could be an angle like this, it could be an angle like this, it cannot be an angle like this, and we know that the sine of an angle is the Y coordinate, and so we know that for the first of second quadrant the Y coordinate is going to be non-negative. So we would want to take the positive square root, so we would get sine of theta, is equal to the principal root, or we could even think of it as the positive square root of one minus C over two. So let's go back to our... Make sure we can check our answers. So sine of theta is equal to the square root of one minus capital C, all of that over two, and we got it right.",math_algebra-home_alg-trig-functions
" If you followed some of the mathematics, and some of the thermodynamic principles in the last several videos, what occurs in this video might just blow your mind. So not to set expectations too high, let's just start off with it. So let's say I have a container. And in that container, I have gas particles. Inside of that container, they're bouncing around like gas particles tend to do, creating some pressure on the container of a certain volume. And let's say I have n particles. Now, each of these particles could be in x different states. Let me write that down. What do I mean by state? Well, let's say I take particle A. Let me make particle A a different color. Particle A could be down here in this corner, and it could have some velocity like that. It could also be in that corner and have a velocity like that. Those would be two different states. It could be up here, and have a velocity like that. It could be there and have a velocity like that. If you were to add up all the different states, and there would be a gazillion, of them, you would get x. That blue particle could have x different states. You don't know. We're just saying, look. I have this container. It's got n particles. So we just know that each of them could be in x different states. Now, if each of them can be in x different states, how many total configurations are there for the system as a whole? Well, particle A could be in x different states, and then particle B could be in x different places. So times x. If we just had two particles, then you would multiply all the different places where X could be times all the different places where the red particle could be, then you'd get all the different configurations for the system. But we don't have just two particles. We have n particles. So for every particle, you'd multiply it times the number of states it could have, and you do that a total of n times. And this is really just combinatorics here. You do it n times. This system would have n configurations. For example, if I had two particles, each particle had three different potential states, how many different configurations could there be? Well, for every three that one particle could have, the other one could have three different states, so you'd have nine different states. You'd multiply them. If you had another particle with three different states, you'd multiply that by three, so you have 27 different states. Here we have n particles. Each of them could be in x different states. So the total number of configurations we have for our system-- x times itself n times is just x to the n. So we have x to the n states in our system. Now, let's say that we like thinking about how many states a system can have. Certain states have less-- for example, if I had fewer particles, I would have fewer potential states. Or maybe if I had a smaller container, I would also have fewer potential states. There would be fewer potential places for our little particles to exist. So I want to create some type of state variable that tells me, well, how many states can my system be in? So this is kind of a macrostate variable. It tells me, how many states can my system be in? And let's call it s for states. For the first time in thermodynamics, we're actually using a letter that in some way is related to what we're actually trying to measure. s for states. And since the states, they can grow really large, let's say I like to take the logarithm of the number of states. Now this is just how I'm defining my state variable. I get to define it. So I get to put a logarithm out front. So let me just put a logarithm. So in this case, it would be the logarithm of my number of states-- so it would be x to the n, where this is number of potential states. And you know, we need some kind of scaling factor. Maybe I'll change the units eventually. So let me put a little constant out front. Every good formula needs a constant to get our units right. I'll make that a lowercase k. So that's my definition. I call this my state variable. If you give me a system, I should, in theory, be able to tell you how many states the system can take on. Fair enough. So let me close that box right there. Now let's say that I were to take my box that I had-- let me copy and paste it. I take that box. And it just so happens that there was an adjacent box next to it. They share this wall. They're identical in size, although what I just drew isn't identical in size. But they're close enough. They're identical in size. And what I do, is I blow away this wall. I just evaporate it, all of a sudden. It just disappears. So this wall just disappears. Now, what's going to happen? Well, as soon as I blow away this wall, this is very much not an isostatic process. Right? All hell's going to break loose. I'm going to blow away this wall, and you know, the particles that were about to bounce off the wall are just going to keep going. Right? They're going to keep going until they can maybe bounce off of that wall. So right when I blow away this wall, there's no pressure here, because these guys have nothing to bounce off to. While these guys don't know anything. They don't know anything until they come over here and say, oh, no wall. So the pressure is in flux. Even the volume is in flux, as these guys make their way across the entire expanse of the new volume. So everything is in flux. Right? And so what's our new volume? If we call this volume, what's this? This is now 2 times the volume. Let's think about some of the other state variables we know. We know that the pressure is going to go down. We can even relate it, because we know that our volume is twice it. Is 2 times the volume. What about the temperature? Well, the temperature change. Temperature is average kinetic energy, right? Or it's a measure of average kinetic energy. So all of these molecules here, each of them have kinetic energy. They could be different amounts of kinetic energy, but temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy. Now, if I blow away this wall, does that change the kinetic energy of these molecules? No! It doesn't change it at all. So the temperature is constant. So if this is T1, then the temperature of this system here is T1. And you might say, hey, Sal, wait, that doesn't make sense. In the past, when my cylinder expanded, my temperature went down. And the reason why the temperature went down in that case is because your molecules were doing work. They expanded the container itself. They pushed up the cylinder. So they expended some of their kinetic energy to do the work. In this case, I just blew away that wall. These guys did no work whatsoever, so they didn't have to expend any of their kinetic energy to do any work. So their temperature did not change. So that's interesting. Fair enough. Well, in this new world, what happens? Eventually I get to a situation where my molecules fill the container. Right? We know that from common sense. And if you think about it on a microlevel, why does that happen? It's not a mystery. You know, on this direction, things were bouncing and they keep bouncing. But when they go here, there used to be a wall, and then they'll just keep going, and then they'll start bouncing here. So when you have gazillion particles doing a gazillion of these bounces, eventually, they're just as likely to be here as they are over there. Now. Let's do our computation again. In our old situation, when we just looked at this, each particle could be in one of x places, or in one of x states. Now it could be in twice as many states, right? Now, each particle could be in 2x different states. Why do I say 2x? Because I have twice the area to be in. Now, the states aren't just, you know, position in space. But everything else-- so, you know, before here, maybe I had a positions in space times b positions, or b momentums, you know, where those are all the different momentums, and that was equal to x. Now I have 2a positions in volume that I could be in. I have twice the volume to deal with. So I have 2a positions in volume I can be at, but my momentum states are going to still be-- I just have b momentum states-- so this is equal to 2x. I now can be in 2x different states, just because I have 2 times the volume to travel around in, right? So how many states are there for the system? Well, each particle can be in 2x states. So this is 2x times 2x times 2x. And I'm going to do that n times. So my new s-- so this is, you know, let's call this s initial-- so my s final, my new way of measuring my states, is going to be equal to that little constant that I threw in there, times the natural log of the new number of states. So what is it? It's 2x to the n power. So my question to you is, what is my change in s when I blew away the wall? You know, there was this room here the entire time, although these particles really didn't care because this wall was there. So what is the change in s when I blew away this wall? And this should be clear. The temperature didn't change, because no 1kinetic energy was expended. 1And this is all in isolation. 1I should have said. 1It's adiabatic. 1There's no transfer of heat. 1So that's also why the temperature didn't change. 1So what is our change in s? 1Our change in s is equal to our s final minus our s 1initial, which is equal to-- what's our s final? 1It's this expression, right here. 1It is k times the natural log--and we can write this as 12 to the n, x to the n. 1That's just exponent rules. 1And from that, we're going to subtract out our initial s 1value, which was this. k natural log of x to the n. 1Now we can use our logarithm properties to say, well, you 1know, you take the logarithm of a minus the logarithm of b, 1you can just divide them. 1So this is equal to k-- you could factor that out-- times 1the logarithm of 2 to the N-- it's uppercase N, 1so let me do that. 1This is uppercase N. 1I don't want to get confused with Moles. 1Uppercase N is the number of particles we actually have. So 1it's 2 to upper case N times x to the uppercase N divided by 1x to the uppercase N. 1So these two cancel out. 1So our change in s is equal to k times the natural log of 2 1to the N-- or, if we wanted to use our logarithm properties, 1we could throw that N out front. 1And we could say, our change in the s, whatever this state 1variable I've defined-- and this is a different definition 1than I did in the last video-- is equal to big N, the number 1of molecules we have, times my little constant, times the 1natural log of 2. 1So by blowing away that wall and giving my molecules twice 1as much volume to travel around in, my change in this 1little state function I defined is Nk the 1natural log of 2. 1And what really happened? 1I mean, it clearly went up, right? 1I clearly have a positive value here. 1Natural log of 2 is a positive value. 1N is positive value. 1It's going to be very large number than the number of 1molecules we had. 1And I'm assuming my constant I threw on there 1is a positive value. 1But what am I really describing? 1I'm saying that look, by blowing away that wall, my 1system can take on more states. 1There's more different things it can do. 1And I'll throw a little word out here. 1Its entropy has gone up. 1Well, actually, let's just define s 1to be the word entropy. 1We'll talk more about the word in the future. 1Its entropy has gone up, which means the number of states we 1have has gone up. 1I shouldn't use the word entropy without just saying, 1entropy I'm defining as equal to S. 1But let's just keep it with s. s for states. 1The number of states we're dealing with has gone up, and 1it's gone up by this factor. 1Actually, it's gone up by a factor of 2 to the n. 1And that's why it becomes n natural log of 2. 1Fair enough. 1Now you're saying, OK. 1This is nice, Sal. 1You have this statistical way, or I guess you could, this 1combinatoric way of measuring how many states this system 1can take on. 1And you looked at the actual molecules. 1You weren't looking at the kind of macrostates. 1And you were able to do that. 1You came up with this macrostate that says, that's 1essentially saying, how many states can I have? 1But how does that relate to that s that defined in the 1previous video? 1Remember, in the previous video, I was looking for state 1function that dealt with heat. 1And I defined s, or change in s-- I defined as change in s-- 1to be equal to the heat added to the system divided by the 1temperature that the heat was added at. 1So let's see if we can see whether these things are 1somehow related. 1So let's go back to our system, and go to a PV 1diagram, and see if we can do anything useful with that. 1Alright. 1OK. 1So this is pressure, this is volume. 1Now. 1When we started off, before we blew away the wall, we had 1some pressure and some volume. 1So this is V1. 1And then we blew away the wall, and we got to-- 1Actually, let me do it a little bit differently. 1I want that to be just right there. 1Let me make it right there. 1So that is our V1. 1This is our original state that we're in. 1So state initial, or however we want it. 1That's our initial pressure. 1And then we blew away the wall, and our 1volume doubled, right? 1So we could call this 2V1. 1Our volume doubled, our pressure would have gone down, 1and we're here. 1Right? 1That's our state 2. 1That's this scenario right here, after we 1blew away the wall. 1Now, what we did was not a quasistatic process. 1I can't draw the path here, because right when I blew away 1the wall, all hell broke loose, and things like 1pressure and volume weren't well defined. 1Eventually it got back to an equilibrium where this filled 1the container, and nothing else was in flux. 1And we could go back to here, and we could say, OK, now the 1pressure and the volume is this. 1But we don't know what happened in between that. 1So if we wanted to figure out our Q/T, or the heat into the 1system, we learned in the last video, the heat added to the 1system is equal to the work done by the system. 1We'd be at a loss, because the work done by the system is the 1area under some curve, but there's no curve to speak of 1here, because our system wasn't defined while all the 1hell had broke loose. 1So what can we do? 1Well, remember, this is a state function. 1And this is a state function. 1And I showed that in the last video. 1So it shouldn't be dependent on how we got 1from there to there. 1Right? 1So this change in entropy-- actually, let me be careful 1with my words. 1This change in s, so s2 minus s1, should be independent of 1the process that got me from s1 to s2. 1So this is independent of whatever crazy path-- I mean, 1I could have taken some crazy, quasistatic 1path like that, right? 1So any path that goes from this s1 to this s2 will have 1the same heat going into the system, or should have the 1same-- let me take that-- 1Any system that goes from s1 to s2, regardless of its path, 1will have the same change in entropy, or their 1same change in s. 1Because their s was something here, and it's something 1different over here. 1And you just take the difference between the two. 1So what's a system that we know that can do that? 1Well, let's say that we did an isothermal. 1And we know that these are all the same isotherm, right? 1We know that the temperature didn't change. 1I told you that. 1Because no kinetic energy was expended, and none of the 1particles did any work. 1So we can say, we can think of a theoretical process in which 1instead of doing something like that, we could have had a 1situation where we started off with our original container 1with our molecules in it. 1We could have put a reservoir here that's equivalent to the 1temperature that we're at. 1And then this could have been a piston that was maybe, we 1were pushing on it with some rocks that are pushing in the 1left-wards direction. 1And we slowly and slowly remove the rocks, so that 1these gases could push the piston and do some work, and 1fill this entire volume, or twice the volume. 1And then the temperature would have been kept constant by 1this heat reservoir. 1So this type of a process is kind of a sideways version of 1what I've done in the Carnot diagrams. That would be 1described like this. 1You'd go from this state to that state, and it would be a 1quasistatic static process along an isotherm. 1So it would look like that. 1So you could have a curve there. 1Now, for that process, what is the area 1under the curve there? 1Well, the area under the curve is just the integral-- and 1we've done this multiple times-- from our initial 1volume to our second volume, which is twice it, of p times 1our change in volume, right? 1p is our height, times our little changes in volume, give 1us each rectangle. 1And then the integral is just the sum along all of these. 1So that's essentially the work that this system does. 1Right? 1And the work that this system does, since we are on an 1isotherm, it is equal to the heat added to the system. 1Because our internal energy didn't change. 1So what is this? 1We've done this multiple times, but I'll redo it. 1So this is equal to the integral of V1 to 2V1. 1PV equals NRT, right? 1NRT. 1So P is equal to NRT/V. 1NRT over V dv. 1And the t is T1. 1Now, all of this is happening along an isotherm, so all of 1these terms are constant. 1So this is equal to the integral from V1 to 2V1 of 1NRT1 times 1 over V dv. 1I've done this integral multiple times. 1And so this is equal to-- I'll skip a couple of steps here, 1because I've done it in several videos already-- the 1natural log of 2V1 over V1, right? 1The antiderivative of this is the natural log. 1Take the natural log of that minus the natural log of that, 1which is equal to the natural log of 2V1 over V1. 1Which is just the same thing as NRT1 times the 1natural log of 2. 2Interesting. 2Now, let's add one little one little interesting thing to 2this to this equation. 2So this is NRT, but if I wanted to write in terms of 2the number of molecules, N is the number of moles. 2So I could rewrite N as the number of molecules we have 2divided by, 6 times 10 to the 23 power. 2Right? 2That's what n could be written as. 2So if we do it that way, then what is our-- remember, all of 2this, we were trying to find the amount of 2work done by our system. 2Right? 2But if we do it this way, this equation will turn 2into-- so let's see. 2The work done by our system-- this is our quasistatic 2processes that's going from this state to that state, but 2it's doing it in a quasistatic way, so that we can get an 2area under the curve. 2So the work done by this system is equal to-- 2I'll just write it. 2N times R over 6 times 10 to the 23, times T1 2natural log of 2. 2Fair enough. 2Let's make this into some new constant. 2For convenience, let me call it a lowercase k. 2So the work we did is equal to the number of particles we 2had, times some new constant-- we'll call that Boltzmann 2constant, so it's really just 8 divided by that. 2Times T1, times the natural log of 2. 2Fair enough. 2Now, that's only in this situation. 2The other situation did no work, right? 2So I can't talk about this system doing any work. 2But this system did do some work. 2And since it did it along an isotherm, delta-- the change 2in internal energy is equal to 0, so the change in internal 2energy, which is equal to the heat applied to the system 2minus the work done by the system-- this is going to be 2equal to 0, since our temperature didn't change. 2So the work is going to be equal to the heat 2added to the system. 2So the heat added to the system by our little reservoir 2there is going to be-- so the heat is going to be the number 2of particles we had times Boltzmann constant, times our 2temperature that we're on the isotherm, times the 2natural log of 2. 2And all this is a byproduct of the fact that 2we doubled our volume. 2Now, in the last video, I defined change in s as equal 2to Q divided by the heat added, divided by the 2temperature at which I'm adding it. 2So for this system, this quasistatic system, what was 2the change in s? 2How much did our s-term, our s-state, change by? 2So change in s is equal to heat added divided by our 2temperature. 2Our temperature is T1, so that's equal to this thing. 2Nk T1 times the natural log of 2, all of that over T1. 2So our delta-- these cancel out. 2And our change in our s-quantity is equal to Nk 2times the natural log of 2. 2Now, you should be starting to experience an a-ha moment. 2When we defined in the previous video, we were just 2playing with thermodynamics, and we said, gee, we'd really 2like to have a state variable that deals with heat, and we 2just made up this thing right here that said, change in that 2state variable is equal to the heat applied to the system 2divided by the temperature at which the heat was applied. 2And when we use that definition the change in our 2s-value from this position to this position, for a 2quasi-static process, ended up being this. 2Nk natural log of 2. 2Now, this is a state function. 2State variable. 2It's not dependent on the path. 2So any process that gets from here, that gets from this 2point to that point, has to have the same change in s. 2So the delta s for any process is going to be equal to that 2same value, which was N, in this case, k, times the 2natural log of 2. 2Any system, by our definition, right? 2It's the state variable. 2I don't care whether it disappeared, or the path was 2some crazy path. 2It's a state. 2It's only a function of that and of that, our change in s. 2So given that, even this system-- we said that this 2system that we started the video out with, it started off 2at this same V1, and it got to the same V2. 2So by the definition of the previous video, by this 2definition, its change in s is going to be the number of 2molecules times some constant times the natural log of 2. 2Now, that's the same exact result we got when we thought 2about it from a statistical point of view, when we were 2saying, how many more different states can the 2system take on? 2And what's mind-blowing here is that what we started off 2with was just kind of a nice, you know, macrostate in our 2little Carnot engine world, that we didn't really know 2what it meant. 2But we got the same exact result that when we try to do 2it from a measuring the number of states the 2system could take on. 2So all of this has been a long, two-video-winded version 2of an introduction to entropy. 2And in thermodynamics, a change in entropy-- entropy is 2s, or I think of it, s for states-- the thermodynamic, or 2Carnot cycle, or Carnot engine world, is defined as the 2change in entropy is defined as the heat added to the 2system divided by the temperature at 2which it was added. 2Now, in our statistical mechanics world, we can define 2entropy as some constant-- and it's especially convenient, 2this is Boltzmann's constant-- some constant times the 2natural log of the number of states we have. Sometimes it's 2written as omega, sometimes other things. 2But this time, it's the number of states we have. 2And what just showed in this video is, these are equivalent 2definitions. 2or. 2At least for that one case I just showed you. 2These are equivalent definitions. 2When we used the number of states for this, how much did 2it increase, we got this result. 2And then when we used the thermodynamic definition of 2it, we got that same result. 2And if we assume that this constant is the same as that 2constant, if they're both Boltzmann's constant, both 1.3 2times 10 to the minus 23, then our definitions are 2equivalent. 2And so the intuition of entropy-- in the last one, we 2were kind of struggling with that. 2We just defined it this way, but we were like, what does 2that really mean? 2What change in entropy means, is just how many more states 2can the system take on? 2You know, sometimes when you learn it in your high school 2chemistry class, they'll call it disorder. 2And it is disorder. 2But I don't want you to think that somehow, you know, a 2messy room has higher entropy than a clean room, which some 2people sometimes use as an example. 2That's not the case. 2What you should say is, is that a stadium full of people 2has more states than a stadium without people in it. 2That has more entropy. 2Or actually, I should even be careful there. 2Let me say, a stadium at a high temperature has more 2entropy than the inside of my refrigerator. 2That the particles in that stadium have more potential 2states than the particles in my refrigerator. 2Now I'm going to leave you there, and we're going to take 2our definitions here, which I think are pretty profound-- 2this and this is the same definition-- and we're going 2to apply that to talk about the second law of 2thermodynamics. 2And actually, just a little aside. 2I wrote omega here, but in our example, this was 2 to the N. 2And so that's why it's simplified. 2This was x the first time, and then the second time, when we 2double the size of our room, or our volume, it was x to the 2N times 2 to N. 2I just want to make sure you realize what omega relates to, 2relative to what I just went through. 2Anyway, see you in the next video.",science_chemistry_thermodynamics-chemistry
" -  We have the graph of three functions here. And we're told that one of them is the function F, one is its' first derivative, and then one of them is the second derivative. We just don't know which one is which. And so, like always, pause this video and see if you can figure it out. Alright, now the way I'm going to tackle it is I'm gonna look at each of these graphs and try to think, what would their derivatives look like. So for this first one, we can see our derivative right over here, our slope of our tangent line. It would be a little bit negative and then it gets more and more and more negative, and as we approach this vertical asymptote, right over here, it looks like it's approaching negative infinity. So, the derivative would actually, over here, it would be a little bit less than zero, but then it would get more and more and more negative and then it would approach negative infinity. So, it would have a similar shape, general shape, to the graph itself, at least to the left of this vertical asymptote. Now, what about to the right of the vertical asymptote? Right to the right of the vertical asymptote it looks like the slope of the tangent line is very negative, but then it becomes less and less and less negative, and it looks like it is approaching, it is approaching zero. So, on this side the derivative starts out super negative and then it looks like it is the derivative is going to asymptote towards zero, something like that. So, based on what I just sketched, it looks like this right graph is a good candidate for the derivative of this left graph. You might say, what's wrong with this blue graph? Well this blue graph out here, notice that it's positive. So if this were the derivative of the left graph, then that means the left graph would need a positive slope out here, but it doesn't have a positive slope. It's a slightly negative slope becoming super negative. And so, right here we're slightly negative and then we become very negative. And so maybe this is, let's call this F, and maybe this is F prime. This is F prime right over here. And now, let's look at this middle graph. What would its derivative do? So over here, our slope is slightly negative, and then it becomes more and more and more and more and more negative. And so the derivative of this might look like, it has to be slightly negative, but then it gets more and more and more and more negative as we approach that vertical asymptote. And then on the right side of the vertical asymptote, our derivative is very positive here, and then it gets less and less and less and less and less and less positive. And so, we start our derivative would be very positive and then it would get less and less and less and less positive. It looks like it might, the slope might asymptoting towards zero, so our graph might look something like that. Well the left graph right here looks a lot like what I just sketched out as a candidate derivative for this blue graph, for this middle graph. And so I would say that this is F, then this is the derivative of that, which would make it F prime and then we already established that this right graph is the derivative of the left one, so if it's the derivative of F prime, it's not F prime itself, it's the second derivative. So I feel pretty good about that. And just for good measure, we could think about what the derivative of this graph would look like. Here the slope is slightly negative, but then it gets more and more and more and more and more negative, so the derivative would have a similar shape here. And then here, our derivative would be very positive, and it gets less and less and less and less and less positive. And so, we start very positive and then it gets less and less and less and less and less positive. And so as a general shape, it actually does look a lot like this first graph. But the reason why I'm not gonna say that this first graph is the derivative of the right hand graph, is because this right hand graph was the only good candidate that we had for the derivative of the left hand graph. And so I feel pretty good with what we selected, that this middle one is F, the left one is the first derivative, and the right one is the second derivative.",math_ap-calculus-ab_ab-diff-analytical-applications-new
"  In the video on Fischer esterification we saw that if we took a carboxylic and alcohol, in an acid-catalyzed reaction, we produced an ester, and we also produced water. Our goal in that video was to make more of our ester, so we shifted the equilibrium to the right, to make more of our product. In this video, we're talking about the reverse reaction; we're going to talk about ester hydrolysis. So if we increase the concentration of water, that would shift the equilibrium back to the left, and we would hydrolyze our ester, and turn it into our alcohol and our carboxylic acid. So, it's important to think about what bond we're going to break; you can see that we're going to break this bond, in here, and this oxygen, and this R prime group turn into our alcohol, and so we'll see that in our mechanism. So let's go ahead, and look at the details of the mechanism, where we're starting with an ester, and we're going to, first, think about what else is present. One solution, H two O, and H plus, would give us H three O plus, and I'm going to go ahead and draw in the hydronium ion, over here, so this is H three O plus. The first step of the mechanism is to protonate the carbon EEL oxygen, so this lone pair of electrons picks up a proton from hydronium and let's go ahead and show the protonated carbon EEL, so now we have our oxygen, it has been protonated, so it has a plus one formal charge, so let's show those electrons, so these electrons right here, in magenta, pick up this proton to form this bond right here, and this activates our carbon EEL, so we've seen this in earlier videos, so when you think about a resoce structure, that actually makes this carbon more positive, it's more electrophilic, and therefore, that carbon is going to react with a nucleophile in our next step, and our nucleophile here is water, so water's gonna function as a nucleophile, the nucleophile attacks our electrophile, and that pushes these electrons off, onto this oxygen, so when we show the bond now, between the oxygen and that carbon, let me go ahead and draw in the rest of this: this would be a plus one formal charge on this oxygen, and let me highlight those electrons here, so these electrons in blue, are going to form the bond between this carbon and this oxygen. We still have an oxygen over here, on the left, and now, that oxygen has two lone pairs of electrons, so let me go ahead and show those electrons here, so let me make them green, so these electrons right here, in green, move off onto here, and are now a lone pair on that oxygen, we still have an oxygen bonded to this carbon, and an R prime group. The next step, we need to deprotonate; we need to get rid of that plus one formal charge, and so, a molecule of water can come along, and this time, function as a base, so water's gonna function as a base, gonna take this proton, leaving these electrons behind, on that oxygen, so let's get some space down here, to show the deprotonation, so we would now have this carbon, with an OH on the left, and after we deprotonate, we're also gonna have an OH on the right, so let me go ahead and draw in that OH, on the right, so, showing those electrons, let's make those red, so these electrons in here, are gonna move off onto this oxygen, and then drawing in everything else, we have our R group on the left, and we have OR prime on the right, and I'm gonna go ahead and put in lone pairs of electrons on this oxygen, because in the next step in the mechanism, we're going to protonate that oxygen. So hydronium is present, so H three O plus, so I'm gonna go ahead and draw that in here, so H three O Plus, this oxygen is gonna pick up a proton from hydronium, leaving these electrons behind, and so we're gonna protonate that oxygen, and the reason why we protonate that oxygen is it turns it into a better leaving group, so let me go ahead and draw in everything, so we have our OH groups at the top, we have our R group on the left, we have our oxygen, which has been protonated now, so it's gonna have a plus one formal charge, so plus one formal charge on this oxygen, let's show those electrons, so let's make those blue, here, so I'm saying that this lone pair is gonna take this proton, forming this bond, right here, and if you look closely, you now have alcohol hiding as a leaving group, because in the next step of the mechanism, we're going to reform our carbon EEL, and alcohol is going to leave, so if these electrons move into here, to reform our carbon EEL, that's too many bonds to carbon, and so these electrons are gonna come off, onto the oxygen, and so here's the bond-breaking step, where the alcohol leaves, and so let's go ahead and draw our product, so we're going to form our carbon EEL, and this oxygen is going to have a plus one formal charge now, and we have an R group, and, over here, would be an OH, because the alcohol is going to leave, so I'm gonna go ahead, and draw in the alcohol here, so OR prime, with now two lone pairs of electrons, so let's follow some electrons, so these electrons in blue, are the same ones as blue up here, and let's make these electrons in here red, so these electrons in red are going to come off, onto this oxygen, so we lose our alcohol at this step, so loss of our alcohol gives us this, over here, so we're almost done with our reaction, so this is really close to a carboxylic acid, all we would have to do is deprotonate, so we could think about another molecule of water coming along, and acting as a base, so water acts as a base, takes this proton, leaves these electrons behind, and that, of course, gives us our carboxylic acid. So, if I just go ahead and draw in our R group, and then we have ROH, and let's follow those electrons, so let's make those red as well, so these electrons, right here, come off, and we get our carboxylic acid as our product, so there's your mechanism for acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis, which produces a carboxylic acid, and it produces an alcohol, and when we look at some reactions in a second here, we're gonna think about this part, right here, where we lose our alcohol as one of our products, to also give us our carboxylic acid. So let's look at a reaction: So, over here on the left, we have methyl salicylate, or oil of wintergreen, and we're looking for an ester, because we have H two O and H plus, giving us hydronium in solution, and so this is the portion of the molecule that's going to react, it's going to hydrolyze that ester, and we know from the mechanism, this is the bond that's going to break in our mechanism, and so, we can go ahead and draw our products, so we're gonna break that bond, and the whole left portion, so let me go ahead and draw that, this whole left portion here is going to form our carboxylic acid, so let's go ahead and draw in our carboxylic acid, as one of our products, so we have our ring we have our carboxylic acid, so this OH on our carboxylic acid, this OH came from H two O in the mechanism, and then we have this other OH, which produces, of course, salicylic acid, and then we're thinking about our alcohol product, let me go ahead and use green for this, so this is going to leave, we can see that, after you protonate, you get loss of that as your alcohol, and so if we just add a proton onto this oxygen here, we can see that we would form methanol, as our other product, so if I go ahead and draw in the methanol here, we have our two products: we have salicylic acid, and we have methanol, so acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis. This reaction is at equilibrium, technically, and so you could do things like push the equilibrium to the right, and if you remember from the Fischer esterification video, this is what we use to make our wintergreen; we used methanol, and we used salicylic acid to produce our wintergreen, and so everything depends on reactions conditions, in terms of shifting the equilibrium. Let's look at another practice problem here: So, once again, we have our ester, and we have water, and I drew the water in a little bit of a weird way, and I'll show you why in a second, so acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis, once again, we think about what bond is gonna break; this bond is gonna break, and the left side is going to turn into our carboxylic acid, so we can go ahead and draw our carboxylic acid, so we would have this portion of the molecule, so our carboxylic acid, like that, and once again, this OH, let me go ahead and highlight it, so this OH right here, in our carboxylic acid came from our water molecule, so we could think about losing a proton off of water, and then we form our carboxylic acid on the right, our other product, let's be consistent and stick with green here, this is the portion that's gonna turn into our alcohol, so we think about adding a proton onto that oxygen, and, once again we have methanol, as our other product, so, acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis. Now the reason I drew the water molecule in a weird way, is because, what would happen if, instead of this hydrogen, what would happen if we had an R group, an alkyl group? Well, that would change this hydrogen into an alkyl group, and then we would form an ester as our product, so we'd be starting with one ester, and we'd be turning it into another ester, and that is called, ""transesterification,"" so pretty much the same reaction that we've been talking about, except we wouldn't 1get a carboxylic acid, as one of our products; 1we would get another ester. 1And so, let's go ahead and do this again, starting 1with the same ester, but this time, we're gonna 1use butanol, instead of water. 1So, once again, we can think about losing, 1we're gonna break that bond, and we're going 1to lose this proton, and then we could stick those 1portions of the molecule together. 1So, if we stick this together with this, we can see 1the identity of the other ester that will form, 1so let's go ahead and draw in our product, 1so we would have an oxygen here, and then we'd have 1four carbons: one, two, three, four; 1so these four carbons from butanol, which form our ester. 1Our other product, once again, we see this portion 1over here, that would give us methanol, so once again, 1we have methanol as our product, and even though 1everything is at equilibrium, methanol has a very low 1boiling point, so we could boil off the methanol, 1and shift the equilibrium to the right 1to make more of our product. 1So we can see, once gain, we're starting with an ester 1of methanol, and we're converting it 1into an ester of butanol, 1simply by changing the reaction conditions, 1in a transesterification reaction, 1so this is a pretty useful reaction in industry.",science_organic-chemistry_carboxylic-acids-derivatives
" - Check out these weight lifters. The one on the right is lifting his weight faster, but they're both doing the same amount of work. The reason I can say that, is because work is the amount of energy that's transferred. Or, to put it a simpler way, this is the way I like to think about it, work is equal to the energy you give something, or take away from something. Both weightlifters are giving their weights the same amount of gravitational potential energy, they both lift them two meters, and the masses are 100 kilograms each. Plug those into the formula for gravitational potential energy and you find that the work done by each weight lifter is 1960 joules. But, he weight lifter on the right is lifting his weight faster, and there should be a way to distinguish between what he is doing, and what the other slower weight lifter is doing. We can distinguish their actions and physics by talking about power. Power measures the rate at which someone, like weight lifters, or something like an automobile engine, does work. To be specific, power is defined as the work done, divided by the time that it took to do that work. We already said that both weight lifters are doing 1960 joules of work. The weight lifter on the right takes one second to lift his weights, and the weight lifter on the left takes three seconds to lift his weights. If we plug those times into the definition of power, we'll find that the power output of the weight lifter on the right during his lift is 1960 joules per second, and the power output of the weight lifter on the left, during his lift, is 653 joules per second. A joule per second is named a watt, after the Scottish engineer James Watt. And the watt is abbreviated with a capital W. Alright, lets look at another example. Let's say a 1000 kilogram car starts from rest, and takes two seconds to reach a speed of five meters per second. We can find the power output by the engine by taking the work done on the car, divided by the time it took to do that work. To find the work done on the car, we just need to figure out how much energy was given to the car. In this case, the car was given kinetic energy, and it took two seconds to give it that kinetic energy. If we plug in the values for the mass and the speed, we find that the engine had a power output of 6250 watts. So what does Power mean? Power is the rate at which work is done.",science_in-in-class9th-physics-india_in-in-work-energy
" We're asked to simplify log base 5 of x to the third. And once again, we're just going to rewrite this in a different way. You could argue whether it's going to be more simple or not. And the logarithm property that I'm guessing that we should use for this example right here is the property-- if I take log base x of-- let me pick some more letters here, log base x of y to the zth power. This is the same thing as z times log base x of y. So this is a logarithm property. If I'm taking the logarithm of a given base of something to a power, I could take that power out front and multiply that times the log of the base, of just the y in this case. So we apply this property over here. And in a second, once I do this problem, we'll talk about why this actually makes a lot of sense and comes straight out of exponent properties. But if we just apply that over here, we get log base 5 of x to the third. Well, this is the exponent right over here. That's the same thing as z. So that's going to be the same thing as-- let me do this in a different color-- that 3 is the same thing-- we could put it out front-- that's the same thing as 3 times the logarithm base 5 of x. And we're done. This is just another way of writing it using this property. And so you could argue that this is a what-- maybe this is a simplification because you took the exponent outside of the logarithm, and you're multiplying the logarithm by that number now. Now with that out of the way, let's think about why that actually makes sense. So let's say that we know that-- and I'll just pick some arbitrary letters here-- let's say that we know that a to the b power is equal to c. And so if we know that-- that's written as an exponential equation. If we wanted to write the same truth as a logarithmic equation, we would say logarithm base a of c is equal to b. To what power do I have to raise a to get c? I raise it to the bth power. a to the b power is equal to c. Fair enough. Now let's take both sides of this equation right over here, and raise it to the dth power. So let me make it-- so let's raise-- take both sides of this equation and raise it to the dth power. Instead of doing it in place, I'm just going to rewrite it over here. So I wrote the original equation, a to the b is equal to c, which is just rewriting this statement. But let me take both sides of this to the dth power. And I should be consistent. I'll use all capital letters. So this should be a B. Actually, let's say I'm using all lowercase letters. This is a lowercase c. So let me write it this way, a to the-- so I'm going to raise this to the dth power, and I'm going to raise this to the dth power. Obviously, if these two things are equal to each other, if I raise both sides to the same power, the equality is still going to hold. Now, what's interesting over here is we can now say-- what we could do is we can use what we know about exponent properties. Say, look, if I have a to the b power, and then I raise that to the d power, our exponent properties say that this is the same thing. This is equal to a to the bd power. This is equal to a to the bd. Let me write it here. This is-- let me do that in a different color. I've already used that green. This right over here, using what we know about exponent properties, this is the same thing as a to the bd power. So we have a to the bd power is equal to c to the dth power. And now this exponential equation, if we would write it as a logarithmic equation, we would say log base a of c to the dth power is equal to bd. What power do I have to raise a to get to c to the dth power? To get to this? I have to raise it to the bd power. But what do we know that b is? We already know that b is this thing right over here. So if we substitute this in for b, and we can rewrite this as db, we get logarithm base a of c to the dth power is equal to bd, or you could also call that db, if you switch the order. And so that's equal to d times b. b is just log base a of c. So there you have it. We just derived this property. Log base a of c to the dth, that's the same thing as d times log base a of c, which we applied right over here.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-3
" -  In a previous video, we defined this random variable x. It's a discrete random variable. It can only take on a finite number of values, and I defined it as the number of workouts I might do in a week. And we calculated the expected value of our random variable x, which we could also denote as the mean of x, and we use the Greek letter mu, which we use for population mean. And all we did is, it's the probability-weighted sum of the various outcomes. And we got for this random variable with this probability distribution, we got an expected value or a mean of 2.1. What we're gonna do now is extend this idea to measuring spread. And so we're going to think about what is the variance of this random variable, and then we could take the square root of that to find what is the standard deviation. The way we are going to do this has parallels with the way that we've calculated variance in the past. So the variance of our random variable x, what we're going to do is take the difference between each outcome and the mean, square that difference, and then we're gonna multiply it by the probability of that outcome. So for example for this first data point, you're going to have zero minus 2.1 squared times the probability of getting zero, times 0.1. Then you're going to get plus one minus 2.1 squared times the probability that you get one, times 0.15. Then you're going to get plus two minus 2.1 squared times the probability that you get a two, times 0.4. Then you have plus three minus 2.1 squared times 0.25. And then last but not least you have plus four minus 2.1 squared times 0.1. So once again, the difference between each outcome and the mean, we square it and we multiply times the probability of that outcome. So this is going to be negative 2.1 squared, which is just 2.1 squared, so I'll just write this as 2.1 squared, times .1. That's the first term. And then we're going to have plus one minus 2.1 is negative 1.1, and then we're going to square that, so that's just going to be the same thing as 1.1 squared, which is 1.21 but I'll just write it out, 1.1 squared times .15. And then this is going to be two minus 2.1 is negative .1. When you square it is going to be equal to. So plus .01. If you have negative .1 times negative .1, it's .01 times 0.4, times .4. And then plus we this is going to be 0.9 squared, so that is .81 times .25. And then we're almost there. This is going to be plus 1.9 squared, 1.9 squared times .1. And we get 1.19. So this is all going to be equal to 1.19. And if we wanna get the standard deviation for this random variable, we would denote that with the Greek letter sigma. The standard deviation for the random variable x is going to be equal to the square root of the variance. Square root of 1.19, which is equal to, just get the calculator back here, so we are just going to take the square root of what we just, let's type it again, 1.19. And that gives us, so it's approximately 1.09. Approximately 1.09. So let's see if this makes sense. Let me put this all on a number line right over here. So you have the outcome zero, one, two, three, and four. So you have a 10% chance of getting a zero. So I will draw that like this, let's just say this is a height of 10%. You have a 15% chance of getting one, so that would be 1 1/2 times higher. So it would look something like this. You have a 40% chance of getting a two. That's going to be like this. You have a 40% chance of getting a two. You have a 25% chance of getting a three. Like this. And then you have a 10% chance of getting a four. So like that. So this is a visualization of this discrete probability distribution where I didn't draw the vertical axis here, but this would be .1, this would be .15, this would be .25, and that is .4. And then we see that the mean is at 2.1. The mean is, the mean is at 2.1, which makes sense. Even though this random variable only takes on integer values, you can have a mean that takes on a non-integer value. And then the standard deviation is 1.09. So 1.09 above the mean is going to get us close to 3.2, and 1.09 below the mean is gonna get us close to one. And so this all at least intuitively feels reasonable. This mean does seem to be indicative of the central tendency of this distribution. And the standard deviation does seem to be a decent measure of the spread.",math_ap-statistics_random-variables-ap
" -  Let's say that Y is equal to sin of X squared to the third power, which of course we could also write as sin of X squared to the third power and what we're curious about is what is the derivative of this with respect to X? What is DY/DX which we could also write as Y prime? Well, there's a couple of ways to think about it. This isn't a straightforward expression here but you might notice that I have something being raised to the third power, in fact, if we look at the outside of this expression we have some business in here that's being raised to the third power. And so, one way to tackle this is to apply the chain rule. So, if we apply the chain rule it's gonna be the derivative of the outside with respect to the inside or the something to the third power, the derivative of the something to the third power with respect to that something. So, it's going to be three times that something squared times the derivative with respect to X of that something, in this case, the something is sin, let me write that in the blue color, it is sin of X squared. It is sin of X squared. No matter what was inside of these orange parentheses I would put it inside of the orange parentheses and these orange brackets right over here. We learned that in the chain rule. So, let's see, we know this is just a matter of the first part of the expression is just a matter of algebraic simplification but the second part we need to now take the derivative of sin of X squared. Well, now we would want to use the chain rule again. So, I'm going to take the derivative, it's sin of something, so this is going to be, the derivative of this is gonna be the sin of something with respect to something, so that is cosine of that something times the derivative with respect to X of the something. In this case, the something is our X squared and of course, we have all of this out front which is the three times sin of X squared, I could write it like this, squared. Alright, so we're getting close. Now we just have to figure out the derivative with respect to X of X squared and we've seen that many times before. That, we just use the power rule, that's going to be two X. Two X and so, if we wanted to write the DY/DX, let me get a little bit of a mini drum roll here, this shouldn't take us too long, DY/DX, I'll multiply the three times the two X which is going to be six X, so I've covered those so far times sin squared of X squared, times sin squared of X squared, times cosine of X squared. And we are done applying the chain rule multiple times.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-differentiation-2-new
" -  What I'd like to do in this video is try to figure out what x to the fourth minus two x to the third plus five x divided by x is equal to. So pause this video and see if you can have a go at that before we work through this together. All right, so if we're saying what is this top expression divided by this bottom expression, another way to think about it is, what do I have to multiply, so I'm going to multiply something, I'll put that in parentheses. If I multiply that something times x, I should get x to the fourth minus two x to the third plus five x. Now how do I approach that? Well there's two ways that I could tackle it. One way is I could just rewrite this expression as being, and I will just make this x in yellow so I can keep track of it. I could just rewrite this as one over x times, times x to the fourth minus two x to the third plus five x. And then I can distribute the one over x, and so what is that going to be equal to? Well it's going to be equal to x to the fourth. Let me do this, x to the fourth over x minus two x to the third over x plus five x, plus five x over x. And so what are each of these going to be equal to? X to the fourth divided by x, if I have four x's that I'm multiplying together and then I divide by x, that's going to be equivalent to x to the third power. So this right over here is equal to x to the third. You could also get there from your exponent properties. In the denominator, you have an x to the first power, and so you would subtract the exponents. You have the same base here, so that's x to the third. And then, in this part right over here, what would that equal to? Well it's going to be minus two x to the third divided by x to the first. Well by the same property, that's going to be x squared. And then last but not least, if you take five x's and then you divide by x, you are just going to be left with five. And you can verify that this, indeed, if I were to multiply it by x, I'm gonna get x to the fourth minus two x to the third plus five x. Let me do that. If I put x to the third minus two x squared plus five times x, what I could do is distribute the x. X times x to the third is x to the fourth. X times negative two x squared is negative two x to the third. X times five is five x. Now I mentioned there's two ways that I could do it. Another way that I could try to tackle it is I could look at this numerator and try to factor an x out. I would try to factor out whatever I see in the denominator. So if I do that, actually let me just rewrite the numerator. So I can rewrite x to the fourth as x times x to the third. And then I can rewrite the minus two x to the third as, let me write it this way, as plus x times negative two x squared. And then I could write this five x as being equal to plus x times five. And then I'm gonna divide everything by x, divide everything by x. I just rewrote the numerator here, but for each of those terms, I factored out an x. And now I can factor out x out of the whole thing. So I sometimes think of factoring out an x out of the whole thing as reverse distributive property. So if I factor out this x out of every term, what am I left with? I'm left with an x times x to the third minus two x squared plus five; I ended up doing that in the same color, but hopefully you're following, plus five, and then all of that is divided by x. And as long as x does not equal zero, x divided by x is going to be equal to one, and we're left with what we had to begin with, or the answer that we had to begin with. So these are two different approaches. Nothing super sophisticated here. When you're dividing by x, you're just like hey, that's the same thing as multiplying every term by one over x, or you can factor out an x out of the numerator, and then they cancel out.",math_math3_poly-div
" -  Hey guys. There's one more thing I need to talk about before I can describe the vectorized form for the quadratic approximation of multivariable functions which is a mouthful to say so let's say you have some kind of expression that looks like a times x squared and I'm thinking x is a variable times b times xy, y is another variable, plus c times y squared and I'm thinking of a, b and c as being constants and x and y as being variables. Now, this kind of expression has a fancy name. It's called a quadratic form. Quadratic form. And that always threw me off. I always kind of was like, what, what does form mean? I know what a quadratic expression is and quadratic typically means something is squared or you have two variables but why do they call it a form? And basically it just means that the only things in here are quadratic. It's not the case that you have an x term sitting on its own or a constant out here like two when you're adding all of those together instead it's just you have purely quadratic terms but of course, mathematicians don't want to call it just a purely quadratic expression instead they have to give a fancy name to things so that it seems more intimidating than it needs to be but anyways, so we have a quadratic form and the question is how can we express this in a vectorized sense? And for analogy, let's think about linear terms where let's say you have a times x plus b times y and I'll throw another variable in there, another constant times another variable z. If you see something like this where every variable is just being multiplied by a constant and then you add terms like that to each other, we can express this nicely with vectors where you pile all of the constants into their own vector, a vector containing a, b and c and you imagine the dot product between that and a vector that contains all of the variable components, x, y and z and the convenience here is then you can have just a symbol like a v let's say which represents this whole constant vector and then you can write down, take the dot product between that and then have another symbol, maybe a bold faced x which represents a vector that contains all of the variables and this way, your notation just kind of looks like a constant times a variable just like in the single variable world when you have a constant number times a variable number, it's kind of like taking a constant vector times a variable vector. And the importance of writing things down like this is that v could be a vector that contains not just three numbers but a hundred numbers and then x would have a hundred corresponding variables and the notation doesn't become any more complicated. It's generalizable at the higher dimensions. So the question is can be we do something similar like that with our quadratic form? Because you can imagine let's say we started introducing the variable z then you would have to have some other term, some other constant times the xz quadratic term and then some other constant times the z squared quadratic term and another one for the yz quadratic term and it would get out of hand and as soon as you start introducing things like a hundred variables, it would get seriously out of hand because there's a lot of different quadratic terms so we want a nice way to express this. And I'm just going to kind of show you how we do it and then we'll work it through to see why it makes sense. So usually, instead of thinking of b times xy, we actually think of this as two times some constant times xy and this of course doesn't make a difference. You would just change what b represents but you'll see why it's more convenient to write it this way in just a moment. So the vectorized way to describe a quadratic form like this is to take a matrix, a two by two matrix since this is two dimensions where a and c are in the diagonal and then b is on the other diagonal and we always think of these as being symmetric matrices so if you imagine kind of reflecting the whole matrix about this line, you'll get the same number so it's important that we have that kind of symmetry. And now what you do is you multiply the vector, the variable vector that's got x, y on the right side of this matrix and then you multiply it again but you turn it on its side so instead of being a vertical vector, you transpose it to being a horizontal vector on the other side. And this is a little bit analogous too having two variables multiplied in. You have two vectors multiplied in but on either side. And this is a good point by the way if you are uncomfortable with matrix multiplication to maybe pause the video, go find the videos about matrix multiplication and kind of refresh or learn about that because moving forward, I'm just going to assume that it's something you're familiar with. So going about computing this, first, let's tackle this right multiplication here. We have a matrix multiplied by a vector. Well, the first component that we get, we're going to multiply the top row by each corresponding term in the vector so it'll be a times x. a times x plus b times y. Plus b times that second term y and then similarly for the bottom term, we'll take the bottom row and multiply the corresponding terms so b times x. b times x plus c times y. c times y. So that's what it looks like when we do that right multiplication and of course we've got to keep our transposed vector over there on the right, on the left side. So now, we have, this is just a two by one vector now and this is a one by two. You could think of it as a horizontal vector or a one by two matrix but now when we multiply these guys, you just kind of line up the corresponding terms. You'll have x multiplied by that entire top expression so x multiplied by ax plus by. ax plus by and then we add that to the second term y multiplied by the second term of this guy which is bx plus cy so y multiplied by bx plus cy and all of these are numbers so we can simplify it once we start distributing the first term is x times a times x so that's ax squared and then the next term is x times b times y so that's b times xy. Over here, we have y times b times x so that's the same thing as b times xy so that's kind of why we have, why it's convenient to write a two there because that naturally comes out of our expansion. And then the last term is y times c times y so that's cy squared. So we get back the original quadratic form that we were shooting for. ax squared plus two bxy plus cy squared That's how this entire term expands. As you kind of work it through, you end up with the same quadratic expression. Now, the convenience of this quadratic form being written with a matrix like this is that we can write this more abstractally and instead of writing the whole matrix in, you could just let a letter like m represent that whole matrix and then take the vector that represents the variable, maybe a bold faced x and you would multiply it on the right and then you transpose it and multiply it on the left so typically you denote that by putting a little t as a superscript so x transposed multiplied by the matrix from the left and this expression, this is what a quadratic form looks like in vectorized form and the convenience is the same as it was in the linear case. Just like v could represent something that had a hundred different numbers in it and x would have a hundred different constants, you could do something similar here where you can write that same expression even if the matrix m is super huge. Let's just see what this would look like in a three dimensional circumstance so, actually, I'll need more room so I'll go down even further. So we have x transpose multiplied by the matrix multiplied by x, bold faced x and let's say instead this represented, you have x then y then z, our transposed vector and then our matrix, our matrix let's say was a, b, c, d, e, f and because it needs to be symmetric, whatever term is in this spot here needs to be the same as over here kind of when you reflect it about that diagonal. Similarly, c, that's going to be the same term here and e would be over here. So there's only really six free terms that you have but if fills up this entire matrix and then on the right side, we would multiply that by x, y, z. Now, I won't work it out in this video but you can imagine actually multiplying this matrix by this vector and then multiplying the corresponding vector that you get by this transposed vector and you'll get some kind of quadratic form with three variables and the point is you'll get a very complicated one but it's very simple to express things like this. So with that tool in hand, in the next video, I will talk about how we can use this notation to express the quadratic approximations for multivariable functions. See you then.",math_multivariable-calculus_applications-of-multivariable-derivatives

" So I have six different expressions here, and what I want you to do is pause this video and try to calculate the value of each of these expressions. I'm assuming you've given a go at it. Now let's work through them. So when we see something like this, we have to remember our order of operations. We have 2 times 3 squared, and we have to remember that the first thing we would need to think about are the parentheses. I'll just write paren for short. Then we worry about exponents. Then we will worry about multiplication and division, and actually let me write it this way. We worry about multiplication and division. And then we worry about addition and subtraction. So in this expression right over here, there are no parentheses, so we do the exponents first. So we calculate what 3 squared is. 3 times 3 is 9, so this becomes 2 times 9, which is equal to 18. Now let's look at this one, and this one is interesting, because they have-- it looks like the same expression, but now there are parentheses. And because of these parentheses, we're going to do the multiplication before we take the exponent. So 2 times 3 is going to be 6, and we're going to take that to the second power. So that's 6 times 6, which is equal to 36. Now let's think about this one right over here. Once again, we want to do our multiplication and our division first. So we have a division right over here. 81/9 is the same thing as 81 divided by 9, and that's going to be 9. And then we have-- so it becomes 1 plus 5 times 9. Now we want to do the multiplication before we do the addition, so we're going to do our 5 times 9, which is 45. So this becomes 1 plus 45, which of course is equal to 46. Now let's tackle this one right over here. So, we would want to do the exponents first. So, 1 squared, well that's just going-- let me do this in a different color. 1 squared is just going to be equal to 1, so that's just going to be equal to 1. And so you have 2 times 4 plus 1. What should you do? Should you add first or do the multiplication first? Well multiplication takes precedence over addition, so you're going to do the 2 times 4 first. 2 times 4 is 8, so you're going to have 8 plus 1, which of course is equal to 9. Now you have a very similar expression, but you have parentheses. So that's going to force you to do what's in the parentheses before you take the exponent. But within the parentheses we have multiplication and addition, and we have to remember that we do the multiplication first. So we're going to do the 2 times 4 first, so that's going to be 8 plus 1 to the second power. 8 plus 1 is 9, so that's 9 to the second power. 9 squared is the same thing as 9 times 9, which is equal to 81. Now we have one more right over here that looks very similar to this one, except, once again, we have parentheses that's making us do the addition first. Without parentheses, we would do the multiplication and the division first. But here, we see that 1 plus 5 is 6, and then we have this 81/9, which is 9. So this simplifies to 6 times 9, which of course is equal to 54.",math_cc-sixth-grade-math_cc-6th-arithmetic-operations
" -  We've already seen the equation on the left, which relates the standard change of free energy, delta G zero, to the standard cell potential, E zero. The equation on the right is from thermodynamics and it relates the standard change in free energy, delta G zero, to the equilibrium constant, K. So, we can set these equal to each other to relate the standard cell potential to the equilibrium constant. Since both of these are equal to delta G zero, we can say that this is equal to this. So, now we have negative NFE zero is equal to negative RT natural log of the equilibrium constant, K. Now let's solve for E zero. Let's solve for the standard cell potential. So, to do that, we need to divide both sides by negative NF. So, we get E zero is equal to positive RT over NF natural log of our equilibrium constant. Next, we're gonna solve for what this is equal to. So, if we're at 25 degrees C, alright, so our temperature under standard conditions for our cells that we've been talking about, T is in Kelvin, so we need to convert degrees Celsius into Kelvin, and to do that, you need to add 273.15. So, that gives us 298.15 Kelvin. So, that's what this T is, it's our absolute temperature in Kelvin. R is the gas constant. So, R is equal to 8.314 joules over mole times Kelvin, here. So, we're gonna multiply that by our absolute temperature. And so, our absolute temperature was 298.15, so, this is 298.15 Kelvin. This is all over Faraday's constant. Alright, so remember, F is Faraday's constant. So, this F right here, Faraday's constant, which is 96,500 coulombs per mole, so, the charge of one mole of electrons. So, this give us RT over F. And so, let's get out the calculator and find what this is equal to, here. So, we have 8.314 times 298.1, lemme go back here, .15, and then we're going to divide that by Faraday's constant, 96,500. And so, we get .0257. So, let's round that. .0257, so this give us .0257. What will the units be? Well, Kelvin would cancel out, here, and, let's see, what else cancels out, the moles would cancel out, and that gives us joules over coulombs. Which, of course, is equal to volts. Alright, so we can rewrite our equation, so, the one we had up here. So, we're gonna plug in for RT over F, now. So, now we would have the standard cell potential, E zero, is equal to, well this would be .0257 and that was volts over N. Remember, N is the number of moles that are transferred in your redox reaction. And this is times the natural log of K, our equilibrium constant, here. So, this is one form of the equation that relates the standard cell potential, alright, the standard cell potential E zero, to the equilibrium constant, K. We can write this in a different way. Alright, so what we could do is we could take that .0257, .0257, and we can multiply that by the natural log of ten. So, let's do that. So, we have .0257 times the natural log of ten. And that gives us .0592. So, we get .0592. And the reason why we could do this is to write our equation in log form. Alright, up here, we have natural log, so up here, we have a natural log, but now, we can write it in log form. So, now we have the standard cell potential, E zero, is equal to, well now, we'd have .0592 volts. So, we have .0592 volts, once again, over N, the number of moles of electrons transferred in our redox reaction. And this time, it would be times the log of K. So, not the natural log, the log of K. So, we've taken care of that in our calculation. So, this is just another form of the same equation. Alright, relating the standard cell potential, E zero, to the equilibrium constant, K.",science_chemistry_oxidation-reduction
" -  The gold standard for diagnosing Cystic Fibrosis is called the Sweat Test. Now it's not where you have to exercise a lot and sweat a lot, but the sweat is used to analyze how much chloride is in there. So the point of this whole test is how much chloride. And an abnormally high chloride points to Cystic Fibrosis. A lot of times this test is done in babies and for full-term babies actually age two to four weeks you can already have an accurate test. And the reason why they might get one or the doctor might order one is for example, if they have a genetic reason to maybe have CF, their parents carry the gene or they could have an abnormal newborn screen. Now every baby who is born in the hospital gets a newborn screen. They test for metabolic factors, things that can potentially point to CF and if they have something abnormal there they usually get the Sweat Test. So it's a test that we do if we suspect CF. And the way it's done is actually very simple. The baby or the person doesn't really even have to move. So first we apply a solution to the skin, wherever the area we're testing, which encourages it to make sweat. And then we take two electrodes, one positive, one negative, put it on the skin, turn on the current and this current stimulates the sweat glands. So if this is the skin, back here is the sweat gland. So after it is stimulated to make sweat we then collect it, send it to the lab and see how much chloride there is. That is the Sweat Test. Of course you can always go for genetic testing, right to the source of the gene. We already know what the gene is, and remember it's CFTCR. A thing to remember about this is that even though this is the gene that causes the disease there are many variations between people who have CF who have different variants of it, so it's not always as cut and dry, but for the most part analyzing this gene, seeing if it's normal can diagnose the CF. The Sweat Test and genetic testing are more or less answering a yes or no question, but to ask that question at the appropriate time there are diagnostic clues that we should look for in people who might not know that they have CF. So for people who work with kids when they're even just babies it's important to watch out for people who have failure to thrive, which just means they're not gaining weight and growing as they should. And the first thing you do is make sure the parents are feeding them correctly. But after that you start looking for what we call organic causes, or what's within the baby's metabolism that causes this, and CF is a big one. So failure to thrive, maybe it's good to do a Sweat Test. Or people who are having a lot of frequent, long infections, especially with bacteria or organisms that are not usually found in normal people. For example psuedomonas, this is something that thrives in the environment of the thick mucus that Cystic Fibrosis patients have in their lungs. So this is a type of pneumonia that's seen in a lot of CF patients, but not necessarily in people who don't have it, so this again should tip you off to look for the CF. Of course there's malnourishment, malnutrition I should say because they can eat all the food in the world, but if CF stops their pancreas from helping them digest it then they will have malnutrition. You can get things like a chest x-ray if you want to see the overinflated lungs. You can get abdominal x-ray in babies because CF can affect the intestines and sometimes it is visible on the film. But one thing, actually speaking of babies, that I want to point out is to watch out for babies who have delayed meconium. Not to gross you out, but meconium is the brown sludge that comes out of a baby when they're first born. It's kind of like their first poop, but it's not real poop because they haven't eaten yet, but if the sludge doesn't come out there are several reasons that could be and CF is one of the major reasons. So working with newborns if they don't pass meconium within the first few hours like normal babies do, it's worth it to look into that further and see if they possibly could have Cystic Fibrosis. Diagnosing CF is not really a huge mystery because we know the gene, we know the Sweat Test has a good accuracy, so the key in Cystic Fibrosis diagnosis is to watch out for these clues and think of CF when you see them.",science_health-and-medicine_respiratory-system-diseases
" I promised you that I'd give you some more Pythagorean theorem problems, so I will now give you more Pythagorean theorem problems. And once again, this is all about practice. Let's say I had a triangle-- that's an ugly looking right triangle, let me draw another one --and if I were to tell you that that side is 7, the side is 6, and I want to figure out this side. Well, we learned in the last presentation: which of these sides is the hypotenuse? Well, here's the right angle, so the side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse. So what we want to do is actually figure out the hypotenuse. So we know that 6 squared plus 7 squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared. And in the Pythagorean theorem they use C to represent the hypotenuse, so we'll use C here as well. And 36 plus 49 is equal to C squared. 85 is equal to C squared. Or C is equal to the square root of 85. And this is the part that most people have trouble with, is actually simplifying the radical. So the square root of 85: can I factor 85 so it's a product of a perfect square and another number? 85 isn't divisible by 4. So it won't be divisible by 16 or any of the multiples of 4. 5 goes into 85 how many times? No, that's not perfect square, either. I don't think 85 can be factored further as a product of a perfect square and another number. So you might correct me; I might be wrong. This might be good exercise for you to do later, but as far as I can tell we have gotten our answer. The answer here is the square root of 85. And if we actually wanted to estimate what that is, let's think about it: the square root of 81 is 9, and the square root of 100 is 10 , so it's some place in between 9 and 10, and it's probably a little bit closer to 9. So it's 9 point something, something, something. And that's a good reality check; that makes sense. If this side is 6, this side is 7, 9 point something, something, something makes sense for that length. Let me give you another problem. [DRAWING] Let's say that this is 10 . This is 3. What is this side? First, let's identify our hypotenuse. We have our right angle here, so the side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse and it's also the longest side. So it's 10. So 10 squared is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This is equal to 3 squared-- let's call this A. Pick it arbitrarily. --plus A squared. Well, this is 100, is equal to 9 plus A squared, or A squared is equal to 100 minus 9. A squared is equal to 91. I don't think that can be simplified further, either. 3 doesn't go into it. I wonder, is 91 a prime number? I'm not sure. As far as I know, we're done with this problem. Let me give you another problem, And actually, this time I'm going to include one extra step just to confuse you because I think you're getting this a little bit too easily. Let's say I have a triangle. And once again, we're dealing all with right triangles now. And never are you going to attempt to use the Pythagorean theorem unless you know for a fact that's all right triangle. But this example, we know that this is right triangle. If I would tell you the length of this side is 5, and if our tell you that this angle is 45 degrees, can we figure out the other two sides of this triangle? Well, we can't use the Pythagorean theorem directly because the Pythagorean theorem tells us that if have a right triangle and we know two of the sides that we can figure out the third side. Here we have a right triangle and we only know one of the sides. So we can't figure out the other two just yet. But maybe we can use this extra information right here, this 45 degrees, to figure out another side, and then we'd be able use the Pythagorean theorem. Well, we know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Well, hopefully you know the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. If you don't it's my fault because I haven't taught you that already. So let's figure out what the angles of this triangle add up to. Well, I mean we know they add up to 180, but using that information, we could figure out what this angle is. Because we know that this angle is 90, this angle is 45. So we say 45-- lets call this angle x; I'm trying to make it messy --45 plus 90-- this [INAUDIBLE] is a 90 degree angle --plus is equal to 180 degrees. And that's because the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees. So if we just solve for x, we get 135 plus x is equal to 180. Subtract 135 from both sides. We get x is equal to 45 degrees. Interesting. x is also 45 degrees. So we have a 90 degree angle and two 45 degree angles. Now I'm going to give you another theorem that's not named after the head of a religion or the founder of religion. I actually don't think this theorem doesn't have a name at. All It's the fact that if I have another triangle --I'm going to draw another triangle out here --where two of the base angles are the same-- and when I say base angle, I just mean if these two angles are the same, let's call it a. They're both a --then the sides that they don't share-- these angles share this side, right? --but if we look at the sides that they don't share, we know that these sides are equal. I forgot what we call this in geometry class. Maybe I'll look it up in another presentation; I'll let you know. But I got this far without knowing what the name of the theorem is. And it makes sense; you don't even need me to tell you that. If I were to change one of these angles, the length would also change. Or another way to think about it, the only way-- no, I don't confuse you too much. But you can visually see that if these two sides are the same, then these two angles are going to be the same. If you changed one of these sides' lengths, then the angles will also change, or the angles will not be equal anymore. But I'll leave that for you to think about. But just take my word for it right now that if two angles in a triangle are equivalent, then the sides that they don't share are also equal in length. Make sure you remember: not the side that they share-- because that can't be equal to anything --it's the side that they don't share are equal in length. So here we have an example where we have to equal angles. They're both 45 degrees. So that means that the sides that they don't share-- this is the side they share, right? Both angle share this side --so that means that the side that they don't share are equal. So this side is equal to this side. And I think you might be experiencing an ah-hah moment that right now. Well this side is equal to this side-- I gave you at the beginning of this problem that this side is equal to 5 --so then we know that this side is equal to 5. And now we can do the Pythagorean theorem. We know this is the hypotenuse, right? So we can say 5 squared plus 5 squared is equal to-- let's say C squared, where C is the length of the hypotenuse --5 squared plus 5 squared-- that's just 50 --is equal to C squared. And then we get C is equal to the square root of 50. And 50 is 2 times 25, so C is equal to 5 square roots of 2. Interesting. So I think I might have given you a lot of information there. If you get confused, maybe you want to re-watch this video. But on the next video I'm actually going to give you more information about this type of triangle, which is actually a very common type of triangle you'll see in geometry and trigonometry 45, 45, 90 triangle. And it makes sense why it's called that because it has 45 degrees, 45 degrees, and a 90 degree angle. And I'll actually show you a quick way of using that information that it is a 45, 45, 90 degree triangle to figure out the size if you're given even one of the sides. I hope I haven't confused you too much, and I look forward to seeing you in the next presentation. See you later.",math_geometry_hs-geo-trig
" -  Lilyana runs a cake decorating business, for which 10% of her orders come over the telephone. Let C be the number of cake orders Lilyana receives in a month until she first gets an order over the telephone. Assume the method of placing each cake order is independent. So C, if we assume a few things, is a classic geometric random variable. What tells us that? Well, a giveaway is that we're gonna keep doing these independent trials, where the probability of success is constant, and there's a clear success. A telephone order in this case is a success. The probability is 10% of it happening. And we're gonna keep doing it until we get a success. So classic geometric random variable. Now they ask us, find the probability, the probability, that it takes fewer than five orders for Lilyana to get her first telephone order of the month. So it's really the probability that C is less than five. So like always, pause this video and have a go at it. And even if you struggle with it, that's better. Your brain will be more primed for the actual solution that we can go through together. Alright. (chuckles) So I'm assuming you've had a go at it. So there's a couple of ways to approach it. You could say, well, look, this is just gonna be the probability that C is equal to one, plus the probability that C is equal to two, plus the probability that C is equal to three, plus the probability that C is equal to four. and we can calculate it this way. What is the probability that C equals one? Well, it's the probability that her very first order is a telephone order. And so we'll have 0.1. What's the probability that C equals two? Well, it's the probability that her first order is not a telephone order. So it's one minus 10%. There's a 90% chance it's not a telephone order, and that her second order is a telephone order. What about the probability C equals three? Well, her first two orders would not be telephone orders, and her third order would be one. And then C equals four? Well, her first three orders would not be telephone orders, and her fourth one would. And we could get a calculator maybe, and add all of these things up, and we would actually get the answer. But you're probably wondering, well, this is kind of hairy to type into a calculator. Maybe there is an easier way to tackle this. And indeed, there is. So think about it. The probability that C is less than five, that's the same thing as one minus the probability that we don't have a telephone order in the first four. One minus the probability that no telephone order in first four orders. So what's this? Well, 'cause this is just saying, what's the probability we do have an order in the first four? So it's the same thing as one minus the probability that we don't have an order in the first four. And this is pretty straightforward to calculate. So this is going to be equal to one minus, and let me do this in another color so we know what I'm referring to. So what's the probability that we have no telephone orders in the first four orders? Well, the probability on a given order that you don't have a telephone order is 0.9. And then if that has to be true for the first four, well, it's gonna be 0.9 times 0.9 times 09 times 0.9, or 0.9 to the fourth power. So this a lot easier to calculate, so let's do that. Let's get a calculator out. Alright, so let me just take .9 to the fourth power is equal to, and then let me subtract that from one. So let me make that a negative, and then let me add one to it. And we get, there you go, 0.3439. So this is equal to 0.3439. And we're done. That's the probability that it takes fewer than five orders for her to get her first telephone order of the month.",math_ap-statistics_random-variables-ap
" -  Let's think about the infinite series, so we're going to go from n equals one to infinity, of one over two to the n plus n. And what I want to do is see if we can prove whether this thing converges or diverges. And as you can imagine based on the context of where this video shows up on Khan Academy that maybe we will do it using the comparison test. At any point if you feel like you can kinda take this to the finish line, feel free to pause the video and do so. So in order to kind of figure out or get a sense for this series right over here, it never hurts to kind of expand it out a little bit, so let's do that. So this would be equal to when n equals one this is gonna be one over two to the one plus one, so it's gonna be one over two plus one, it's gonna be one third plus that's n equals one. When n equals two it's gonna be one over two squared, which is four plus two plus one over six. Plus let's see we go to three, n equals one, n equals two, n equals three is gonna be one over two to the third, which is eight plus three is 11. So one over 11, maybe I'll do one more term. Two the fourth power is going to be 16 plus four is 20. Plus one over 20 and obviously we just keep going on and on and on. So it looks, it feels like this thing could converge. All of our terms are positive, but they are getting smaller and smaller quite fast. And if we really look at the behavior of the terms as n gets larger and larger, we see that the two to the n in the denominator will grow much, much faster than the n will. So this kind of behaves like one over two to the n, which is a clue of something that we might be able to use for the comparison test. So let me just write that down. So we have one over, so the infinite series from n equals one to infinity of one over two to the n, and so when n equals one this is going to be equal to one half. When n is equal to two this is going to be equal to one fourth. When n is equal to three this is equal to one eighth. When n is equal to four this is equal to one sixteenth. And we go on and on and on and on. And what's interesting about this is we recognize it. This is a geometric series, so let me be clear. This thing right over here, that is the same thing as the sum of from n equals one to infinity of one half to the n power, just writing it in a different way. And since the absolute value of one half, which is just one half, so because the absolute value of one half is less than one we know that this geometric series converges, we know that it converges And actually we even have formulas for finding the exact sum of or to figure out what it converges to. And so we know this thing converges and we see that actually these two series combined meet all of the constraints we need for the comparison test. So let's go back to what we wrote about the comparison test. So the comparison test, we have two series, all of their terms are greater than or equal to zero. All of these terms are greater than or equal to zero. And then for the corresponding terms in one series, all of them are going to be less than or equal to the corresponding terms in the next one. And so if we look over here, we can consider this one, the magenta series, this is kind of our infinite series of dealing with A sub n and that this right over here is, well I already did it in blue this is kind of the blue series. And notice all their terms are nonnegative and the corresponding terms one half is greater than one third, one fourth is greater than one sixth, one eighth is greater than one eleventh. One over two to the n is always going to be greater than one over two to the n plus n for the n that we care about here. And since we know that this converges, since we know that the larger one converges. It's a geometric series where the common ratio the absolute value of the common ratio is less than one, since we know that the larger series converges therefore, the smaller series or the one where every corresponding term is less than the one in the blue one, that one must also converge. So by the comparison test the series in question must also converge.",math_calculus-all-old_series-calc
" Graph the inequality y minus 4x is less than negative 3. So the first thing we could do is we could kind of put this in mx plus b form, or slope-intercept form, but as an inequality. So we're starting with y minus 4x is less than negative 3. We can add 4x to both sides of this inequality. So let's add 4x to both sides of this inequality, and then we'll just have a y on the left-hand side. These guys cancel out. So you have y is less than 4x minus 3. We could have had negative 3 plus 4x, but we want to write the 4x first just because that's a form that we're more familiar with. So it's less than 4x minus 3. And now we can attempt to graph it. But before I graph it, I want to be a little bit careful here. So let me draw our axes. So this is the x-axis, and is that is the y-axis. And we want to be careful, because this says y is less than 4x minus 3, not less than or equal to 4x minus 3, or not y is equal to 4x minus 3. So what we want to do is kind of create a boundary at y is equal to 4x minus 3, and the solution to this inequality will be all of the area below that, all of the y values less than that. So let's try to do it. So the boundary line would look like-- so let me write it over here-- so we have a boundary at y is equal to 4x minus 3. Notice this isn't part of the solution. This isn't less than or equal. It's just less than. But this will at least help us draw, essentially, the boundary. So we could do it two ways. If you know slope and y-intercept, you know that 4 is our slope and that negative 3 is our y-intercept. Or you can literally just take two points, and that'll help you define a line here. So you could say, well, when x is equal to 0, what is y? You get 4 times 0 minus 3, you get y is equal to negative 3. And we knew that because it was the y-intercept. So you have 0, and then you have 1, 2, 0, and negative 3. And then you have the point, let's say, when x is equal to-- I don't know-- let's say when x is equal to 2. When x is equal to 2, what is y? We have 4 times 2 is 8 minus 3, y is then going to be equal to 5. So then you go 1, 2, and you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And so you have that point there as well. And then we can just connect the dots. Or you could say, look, there's a slope of 4. So every time we move over 1, every time we move 1 in the x direction, we move up 4 in the y direction. So we could draw it like that. So the line will look something like this. And I'm just going to draw it in a dotted line because, remember, this isn't part of the solution. Actually, let me draw it a little bit neater because that point should be right about there, and this point should be right about there. And then this boundary line I'm going to draw as a dotted line. So it's going to look something like that. I draw it a dotted line to show that it's not part of the solution. Our solution has the y's less than that. So for any x, so you pick an x here, if you took 4x minus 3, you're going to end up on the line. But we don't want the y's that are equal to that line. We want for that particular x, the y's that are less than the line. So it's going to be all of this area over here. We're less than the line, and we're not including the line, and that's why I put a dotted line here. You can also try values out. You can say, well, this line is dividing our coordinate axes into, essentially, the region above it and the region below it, and you can test it out. Let's take something that's above it. Let's take the point 0, 0 and see if that satisfies our inequality. If we have y is 0 is less than 0 minus 3, or we get 0 is less than negative 3. This is definitely not the case. This is not true. And it makes sense because that 0, 0 is not part of the solution. Now, we could go on the other side of our boundary line. And we could take the point, I don't know, let's take the point 3 comma 0. So let's say that this is the point-- well, that's right. There's a point 2 comma 0. Let's take the point 3 comma 0 right over here. This should work because it's in the region less than. But let's verify it for ourselves. So we have y is 0. 0 is less than 4 times 3 minus 3. 0 is less than 12 minus 3. 0 Is less than 9, which is definitely true. So that point does satisfy the inequality. So in general, you want to kind of look at this as an equal to draw the boundary line. We did it. But we drew it as a dotted line because we don't want to include it because this isn't less than or equal to. It's just less than. And then our solution to the inequality will be the region below it, all the y's less than the line for x minus 3.",math_in-in-grade-11-ncert_in-in-class11-linear-inequalities
" - This is an animal, and this is also an animal, and animal, animal, animal carcass, animal, animal, animal carcass again, animal. The thing that all of these other things have in common is that they're made out of the same basic building block, the animal cell. (upbeat, lively music) Animals are made up of your run-of-the-mill eukaryotic cells, and these are called eukaryotic because they have a true kernel in the Greek, a good nucleus, and that contains the DNA and calls the shots for the rest of the cell. Also containing a bunch of organelles. There's a bunch of different kinds of organelles, and they all have very specific functions and all of this is surrounded by the cell membrane. Of course, plants are eukaryotic cells too, but they're set up a little bit differently. Of course, they have organelles that allow them to make their own food, which is super nice. We don't have those. And also their cell membrane is actually a cell wall. It's made of cellulose. It's rigid, which is why plants can't dance. If you wanna know all about plant cells, we did a whole video on it, and you can click on it here, if it's online yet. It might not be. A lot of stuff in this video is going to apply to all eukaryotic cells, which includes plants and fungi and protists. Now, rigid cell walls that's cool and all, but one of the reasons that animals have been so successful is that their flexible membrane, in addition to allowing them the ability to dance, gives animals the flexibility to create a bunch of different cell types and organ types and tissue types that could never be possible in a plant. The cell walls that protect plants, and give them structure prevent them from evolving complicated nerve structures and muscle cells that allow animals to be such a powerful force for, you know, eating plants. Animals can move around, find shelters and food, find things to mate with. All that good stuff. In fact, the ability to move oneself around using specialized muscle tissue has been 100% trademarked by kingdom animalia. - [Man] Ah, what about protozoans? - Excellent point. What about protozoans? They don't have specialized muscle tissue. They move around with cilia and flagella and that kind of thing. So way back, in 1665, British scientist Robert Hooke discovered cells with his kind of crude, beta version microscope. He called them cells because they looked like bare spartan monks bedrooms with not much going on inside. Hooke was a smart guy and everything, but he could not have been more wrong about what was going on inside of a cell. There is a whole lot going on inside of a eukaryotic cell. It's more like a city than a monk's cell. In fact, let's go with that. A cell is like a city. It has defined geographic limits, of rule in government, power plants roads, waste treatment plants, a police force, industry, all the things a booming metropolis needs to run smoothly, but this city does not have one of those hippy governments where everybody votes on stuff and talks this out at town hall meetings and crap like that. Nope, think fascist Italy circa 1938. Think Kim Jong-il's, no I mean Kim Jong-un's North Korea, and you might be getting a closer idea of how eukaryotic cells do their business. Let's start with city limits. So as you approach the city of eukaryopolis, there is a chance that you will noticE something that a traditional city never has, which is either cilia or flagella. Some eukaryotic cells have either one or the other of these structured cilia being a bunch of tiny, little arms that wiggle around and flagella being one long whiplike tail. Some cells have neither. Sperm cells, for instance, have flagella, and our lungs and throat cells have cilia that push mucus up and out of our lungs. Cilia and flagella are made out of long protein fibers called microtubules, and they both have the same basic structure. Nine pairs of microtubules forming a ring around two central microtubules. This is often called the nine plus two structure. Anyway, that's just do you know, when you're approaching the city, watch out for the cilia and flagella. IF you make it past the cilia, you will encounter what is called a cell membrane, which is a kind of squishy not rigid plant cell wall, which totally encloses the city and all of its contents. It's also in charge of monitoring what comes in and out of the cell, kind of like the fascist border police. The cell membrane has selective permeability meaning that it can choose what molecules Come in and out of the cells for the most part, and I did an entire video on this, which you can check out right here. Now the landscape of eurkaryopolis important to note is kind of wet and squishy. It's a bit of swampland. Each eukaryotic cell is filled with a solution of water and nutrients called cytoplasm, and inside of this cytoplasm is a scaffolding called the cytoskeleton. It's basically just a bunch of protein strands that reinforce the cell. Centrosomes are a special part of this reinforcement. They assemble long microtubules out of proteins that act like steel girders that hold all the city's buildings together. The cytoplasm provides the infrastructure necessary for all the organelles to all of their awesome, amazing business with the notable exception of the nucleus, which has its own kind of cytoplasm called the nucleoplasm, which is a more luxurious premium environment befitting the cell's beloved leader, but we'll get to that in a minute. First, let's talk about the cell's highway system. The endoplasmic reticulum, or just ER, are organelles that create a network of membranes that carry stuff around the cell. These membranes are phospolipid bilayers same as in the cell membrane. There are two type of ER. There's the rough and the smooth, fairly similar but slightly different shapes, slightly different functions. The rough ER looks all bumpy because it has ribosomes attached to it and the smooth ER doesn't, so it's a smooth network of tubes. Smooth ER acts as a kind of factory warehouse in the cell's city. It contains enzymes that help with the creation of important lipids, which you'll recall from our talk about biological molecules. Eh yeah, phospholipids and steroids that turn out to be sex hormones. Other enzymes in the smooth ER specialize in detoxifying substances like noxious stuff derived from drugs and alcohol, which they do by adding a carboxyl group to them making them soluble in water. Finally, the smooth ER also stores ions and solutions that the cell may need later on especially sodium ions, which are used for energy and muscle cells. So the smooth ER helps make lipids while the rough ER helps in the synthesis and packaging of proteins, and those proteins are created by another type of organelle, the ribosomes. Ribosomes can float freely throughout the cytoplasm or be attached to the nuclear envelope, which is where they're spat out from, and they're job is to assemble amino acids into polypeptides. As the ribosomes builds an amino acid chain, the chain is pushed into the ER. When the protein chain is complete, the ER pinches it off and sends it to the Golgi apparatus. In the city that in the cell, the Golgi is the post office processing proteins, and packaging them up before sending them wherever they need to go. Calling it an apparatus makes it sound like a bit of complicated machinery, which is kind of is because it's made up of like these stacks of membranous layers that are sometimes Golgi bodies. The Golgi bodies can cut up large proteins into smaller hormones, and can combine proteins with carbohydrates to make various molecules like, for instance, snot. The bodies package these little goodies into sacks called vessicles, which have phospholipid walls just like the main cell membrane, then ship them out to either to other parts of the cell or outside the cell wall. We learn more about how vessicles do this in the next episode of Crash Course. The Golgi bodies also put the finishing touches on the lysosomes. Lyosomes are basically the waste treatment plants and recycling centers of the city. These organelles are basically sacks full of enzymes that breakdown cellular waste and debris from outside of the cell and turn it into simple compounds, which are transferred into the cytoplasm as new cell building materials. Now, finally, let us talk about the nucleus, the beloved leader. The nucleus is a highly specialized organelle that lives in its own double-membraned high-security compound with its buddy the nucleolus, and within the cell the nucleus is in charge in a major way because it stores the cell's DNA. It has all the information the cell needs to do its job. So the nucleus makes all the laws for the city, and orders all the other organelles round telling them how and when to grow, what to metabolize, what proteins to synthesize, how and when to divide. The nucleus does all of this by using the information blueprinted in its DNA to build proteins that will facilitate a specific job getting done. For instance, on January 1st 2012, let's say a liver cell needs to help breakdown an entire bottle of champagne. The nucleus in that liver cell would start telling the cell to make alcohol dehydrogenase, which is the enzyme that makes alcohol not alcohol anymore. This protein synthesis business is complicated. Lucky for you, we will have, or may already have, an entire video about how it happens. The nucleus holds its precious DNA along with some proteins in a web-like substance called a chromatin. When it comes time for the cell to split, the chromatin gathers into rod shaped chromosomes each of which holds DNA molecules. Different species of animals have different numbers of chromosomes. We humans have 46. Fruitflies have eight. Hedgehogs, which are adorable, but you know less complex than humans have 90. Now the nucleolus, which lives inside of the nucleus is the only organelle not enveloped by its own membrane. It's just a gooey, splotch of stuff within the nucleus. It's main job is creating ribosomal RNA, or rRNA, which it then combines with some proteins to form the basic units of ribosomes. Once these units are done, the nucleolus spits them out of the nuclear envelope where they are fully assembled into ribosomes. The nucleus then sends orders in the form of messenger RNA or mRNA to those ribosomes, which are the henchmen that carry out the orders in the rest of the cell. How exactly the ribosomes do this is immensely complex and awesome. So awesome, in fact, that we're going to give it the full Crash Course treatment, an entire episode. And, now for what is a totally objectively speaking, of course, the coolest part of the animal cell, its power plants, the mitochondria. The smooth, oblong organelles where the amazing and super important process of respiration takes place. This is where energy is derived from carbohydrates, fat and other fuels and is converted into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, which is like the main currency that drives in eurkaryopolis, and you can learn more about ATP and respiration in an episode that we did on that. Now, of course, some cells like muscle cells or neuron cells need a lot more power than the average cell in the body, and so those cells have a lot more mitochondria per cell, but maybe the coolest thing about mitochondria is that long ago, animal cells didn't have them, 1but they existed as their own sort 1of bacterial cell. 1And one day one of these ended up inside 1of an animal cell, 1probably because the animal cell 1was trying to eat it, 1but instead of eating it, it realized 1that this thing was really super smart 1and good at turning food into energy 1and it just kept it. 1It stayed around. 1And to this day they sort of act like their own 1separate organisms like they do their own thing 1within the cell. 1They replicate themselves. 1They even contain a small amount of DNA. 1Now, it maybe even more awesome, 1if that's possible, is that mitochondria 1are in the egg cell when an egg gets fertilized, 1and those mitochondria have DNA, 1but because mitochondria replicate themselves 1in a separate fashion, it doesn't get mixed 1with the DNA of the father. 1It's just the mother's mitochondrial DNA. 1That means that your and my mitochondrial DNA 1is exactly the same as the mitochondrial DNA 1of our mothers and because this special DNA 1is isolated in this way, scientists 1can actually track back and back and back 1and back to a single mitochondrial Eve, 1who lived about 200,000 years ago in Africa. 1All of that complication and mystery 1and beauty in one of the cells of your body. 1It's complicated yes, but worth understanding.",science_biology_crash-course-bio-ecology
" - In the last video, we worked through essentially the probability distribution for this random variable defined as the number of free throws you make when taking size free throws, assuming you have a 70 percent free throw percentage, and I suggested, hey, why don't you visualize this? Draw the graph of this probability distribution, this binomial probability distribution. And when I thought about it, I said, well, I too would enjoy graphing it, and we might as well do it together, because whenever you graph these things it makes it very visual, and kind of the shape of a binomial distribution like this. So let's do that. So let me maybe move over to the right a little bit, I really just need to be able to keep track of these things right over here. Let me draw some lines. If I were to just draw one line there, and then another line here, and then we have the different percentages. So let's do that. See, the highest one is a little over 32 percent. So maybe we'll go as high as 40 percent here. 40 percent, and then this would be 20 percent. 20, that looks about half way, 20 percent. This would be 10 percent. And this would be 30 percent. And then in this axis, let's do the different values that the random variable could take on. So the random variable taking on the value zero. The random variable taking on the value one. Zero, one, the random variable taking on two. Two, we're almost there. Let's see, three, and then four. Four, and then five. Five, and then finally six. Take x equals six. And then six, and now let's just graph all of these. So this first one, zero point one percent, well, that's barely going to register on this graph right here, so I'll just kind of just give it a little bit of a showing right over there. Showing (mumbles) due to that green color. So, let me make sure. So, in that green color, you're going to have just a little bit of a showing. One, as well, is kind of barely a showing. So it shows up a little bit more. So let me draw it like that. That is one percent, right over there. Now, two is six percent, which on this scale, is going to be about that high. So let me draw it like that. So that is two. So that is six percent right there. X equaling three, 18 and a half percent shot of that happening... So 18 and a half, it's a hand drawn chart, or histogram, so you have to bear with me. So it's roughly there, and then four was 32.4 percent, so that is up here. So 32.4 percent looks like that. Let me shade that in, 32.4 percent. And then five was 30.3 percent, 30.3 percent, slightly lower, just like that. And it will look like this. 30.3 percent, and finally, six is 11.8 percent. So really, this whole video was just an exercise in making a histogram, but it's useful, because to actually visualize what the distribution looks like. And what's really interesting, is to think about how does this change as you change the free throw percentage, or as you change the number of shots you take, how does this change this binomial distribution? And you can do that on a spreadsheet, and actually see how that all works out.",math_ap-statistics_random-variables-ap
" Hello. In this series of presentations I'm going to try to teach you everything you need to know about triangles and angles and parallel lines. And this is probably the highest yield information that you could ever learn, and especially in terms of standardized tests. And then when we've learned all the rules we'll play something that I call the angle game, which is essentially what the SAT makes you do over and over again. So let's start with some basics. Well, you know what an angle is. Well actually, maybe you don't know what an angle is. And I'll tell you what an angle is. If I have two lines-- I'm going to draw a thicker line than that. If I have two lines and they intersect at some point, the angle is a measure of exactly kind of how wide the intersection is between those two lines. Let me use a better tool. So this is the angle. An angle is how wide those two lines kind of open up. And they're measured either in degrees or radians, and for the sake of most of a geometry class we'll use degrees. And when we start doing trigonometry you'll learn radians. Or maybe you could learn it now. And you're probably familiar with this. 0 degrees would be these two lines on top of each other. This, if I were to just eyeball it, looks like 45 degrees. If I had the lines even wider apart like that, that's 90 degrees. And 90 degree lines are also called perpendicular, because they are-- I feel like saying, because they are perpendicular-- but because one is going completely vertical while the other is going horizontal. It's actually amazingly difficult to find the exact right wording. But I think you get the idea. By definition, perpendicular lines have a 90 degree apart from each other. And, you know, you've seen this all the time in things like squares and rectangles. If I were to draw a rectangle like that. Right? A rectangle is made up of a bunch of perpendicular lines, or lines at 90 degree angles. So example. These two lines are at a 90 degree angle. The way you draw a 90 degree angle is you draw a little box like that. That's the same thing as doing this-- as doing a 90 degree angle. And you could even get wider angles. So if you go above 90 degrees. So let's say I had lines like this. So this would be-- I don't know, I'm just eyeballing it-- 135 degrees or something like that. If you ever want to really measure the angles, you can use something called a protractor. That's a tool maybe your teachers can help you use that. So that'd be 135 degrees. And then if you had it so wide that the two lines are actually almost forming a line, then this becomes 180 degrees. It's almost like one line. Right? This is 180 degrees. And then you can keep going. So if this angle here is 135 degrees, you can actually also measure this angle right here. Let me do it in a different color just to add some variety. So then this angle right here. So the angles in a circle are there are 360 degrees in a circle. So if this is 135, this magenta angle would be 360 degrees minus 135 degrees. And that's equal to what? That's 225 degrees, is this magenta angle. And then we could do other things like that. So one, you know that the degrees in the circle are 360 degrees. This is important to know. Degrees in a circle are 360 degrees. It's also important to know that if you just go kind of halfway around a circle, like we did here, that's 180 degrees. Like if you viewed the pivot point as like, let's say, right here. I mean it looks like just one line and it really is. But that's 180 degrees. And then if you go quarter way around the circle, that's 90 degrees. All right? Hopefully you're getting a bit of an intuition for what an angle is. So now I will teach you a bunch of very useful rules for angles. Clear this. So let me redraw. So if I had a line like this. I like using the colors, just so I think it keeps you from getting completely bored. And it might not be completely intuitive what I'm doing, but let's add an angle like that. And so, let's just say-- you know, I'm not measuring these exactly-- let's say that this is 30 degrees. We know that if we go all the way around the circle, we know that that's 360 degrees. Right? And that's a very ugly looking around the circle angle that I drew. So then we also know that this angle right here is 330 degrees. Right? Because this angle plus this magenta angle is going to equal the whole circle. So this is equal to 330 degrees. So remember that. The angles in a circle-- or there are 360 degrees in a circle. I don't know if you remember. You probably don't. This was probably before you were born. But there used to be a game called 720, and it was a skateboarding game-- it was a video game. And the 720 was essentially you were trying to jump your skateboard and spin around twice. And that's 720 degrees. If you go around a circle twice that's 720 degrees. If you just jump and spin around once, you went 360 degrees. So you've probably heard this in just popular culture. But anyway. So 360 degrees in a circle. And you could imagine half a circle is 180 degrees. So the other important thing to realize is, like we said, if we go halfway around the circle it's 180 degrees. But if we have two angles that add up to that-- so let's say. I don't know if these lines are thick enough for you to see. Let me draw something thicker. It doesn't look ideal, but you get the idea. So if we have this angle, let's call it x. And then this angle is y. What do we know about the relationship between x and y? Well, we know that the entire angle is half of a circle. Right? So that's 180 degrees. That's 180 degrees, this entire angle. So what are angles x and y going to add up to? I'm trying to stay color consistent. x plus y are going to equal-- I'm color blind, I think-- 180 degrees. Or you could write y is equal to 180 minus x. Or x is equal to 180 minus y. But if x plus y are equal to 180 degrees-- and you can see that it makes sense that they do-- if you add the two angles you go halfway around a circle. Then that tells us that x and y are-- and this is a fancy word, and it's just good to commit this to memory-- they are supplementary angles. That's when you add to 180 degrees. Now what if we had this situation. Oh my God, that was horrible. Undo. Let's say I had this situation. Let's see. I draw two perpendicular lines. Right? So this is going a quarter way around the circle. All right. Let's say this entire angle here-- I'm drawing it really big-- that's 90 degrees. Right? They're perpendicular. And now if I had two angles within that. So now if I have two angles here-- so let's say that this is x and this is y-- what do x and y add up to? Well, x plus y is 90. And we can say that x and y are complementary. And it's important to not get confused between the two. Just remember complementary means two angles add up to 90 degrees, supplementary means that two angles add up to 180 degrees. I'm running out of time, so I will see you in the next video.",math_geometry-home_geometry-angles
" -  The geometric sequence a sub i, is defined by the formula where the first term, a sub one is equal to negative 1/8, and then every term after that is defined as being, so a sub i is going to be two times the term before that. A sub i is two times a sub i, minus one. What is a sub four, the fourth term in the sequence? Pause the video, and see if you can work this out. Well there's a couple of ways that you could tackle this. One is to just directly use these formulas. We could say that a sub four, well that's going to be this case right over here. A sub four is going to be equal to two times a sub three. Well, a sub three, if we go and use this formula, is going to be equal to two times a sub two. Each term is equal to two times the term before it. Then we go back to this formula again, and say a sub two is going to be two times a sub one. Two times a sub one. Lucky for us, we know that a sub one is negative 1/8. It's going to be two times negative 1/8, which is equal to negative 1/4. Negative 1/4. So this is negative 1/4. Two times negative 1/4, is equal to negative 2/4, or negative 1/2. A sub four is two times a sub three. A sub three is negative 1/2. So this is going to be two times negative 1/2, which is going to be equal to negative one. So that's one way to solve it. Another way to think about it is, look, we have our initial term. We also know our common ratio. We know each successive term is two times the term before it. So we could explicitly, this is a recursive definition for our geometric series. We could explicitly write it as a sub i is going to be equal to our initial term negative 1/8. Then we're going to multiply it by two. We're going to multiply it by two, i minus one times. So we could say times two, to the i minus oneth power. Let's make sure that makes sense. A sub one, based on this formula, a sub one would be negative 1/8, times two to the one minus one. Two to the zeroeth power. So that makes sense. That would be negative 1/8. Based on this formula, a sub two would be negative 1/8, times two to the two minus one. So two to the first power. We're going to take our initial term, and multiply it by two, once. Which is exactly right. A sub two is negative 1/4. So we want to find the fourth term in the sequence, we could just say well, using this explicit formula, we could say a sub four, is equal to negative 1/8, times two to the four, minus one. Two to the four, minus one power. So this is equal to negative 1/8, times two to the third power. This is negative 1/8 times eight. Negative 1/8 times eight, which is equal to negative one. You might be a little bit, a toss up on which method you want to use, but for sure this second method, right over here where we'd come up with an explicit formula once we know the initial term, and we know the common ratio, this would be way easier, if you were trying to find say, the 40th term. Because doing the 40th term recurs to be like this, would take a lot of time, and frankly, a lot of paper.",math_algebra_sequences

""He gets to the same number of comments ""for each cat video that he uploads, ""and he gets the same number of comments ""for each dog video that he uploads."" That's somewhat amazing. The exact same number of comments for each cat video and the exact same number for each dog video. But we'll just assume what they're telling us. ""In the following inequality, C represents ""the number of cat videos, C for cat, ""and D represents the number of dog videos, ""D for dog, dog videos that Goku should upload ""to achieve his goal.""

So let's see if we understand what's going over here, what's going on in this inequality to answer their question. So he wants to get over 9000 comments and we see that right over here. He wants to get over 9000 comments. So this we could view as a number of comments that he actually gets. Since we have some number times C, we can assume that, well C, well we know that C is a number of cat videos and so the number times C, that's the number of comments that he gets from cat videos. And on a per cat video bases, he's going to get 750 comments. Because if I say, ""Hey, look. ""I have C cat videos and on each of them, ""I have exactly 750 comments."" Well, I'm gonna have 750 times C comments on all of my cat videos combined. So each cat video gets 750 comments. And similarly, I can never say that, each dog video gets, well this is the total number of comments from dog videos. You add all of these together. Your total number of comments w to be greater than 9000. Well, if the total from dog videos is 450 D, then we see he's getting 450 comments per dog video. 450 comments per video times the number of dog videos gets the total comments from dog videos. So he gets 450 comments per dog video. ""Can Goku achieve this goal by uploading eight cat videos ""and seven dog videos?"" So let's think about this. Eight cat videos, seven dog videos. So let's see. If we have 750, let me do those in same colors, if we have 750 times eight, times eight plus 450 times seven, is this greater than, I'm writing the question mark so we don't know, is this going to be greater than 9000? Well, we just have to evaluate this. What is this going to be? Let's see. 700 times eight is 5600. It's going to be 5600 plus another 50 times eight is 400. So 5600 plus 400 is 60 hundred or 6000. So this is 6000 right over here. So that would be, if he has eight cat videos, he gets 750 comments per video so he's going to have a total of 6000 comments on all of the eight cat videos combined. And then 450 times seven, let's see, 400 times seven is 2800 plus another 30, plus another 350, that's going to be, what? 3150, is that right? Let's see, that would be, let me show you to this right, 2800 plus 400 times seven is 2800. 50 times seven is 350. Yep, I think that is right. It all, all works out, 3150. So 6000 plus 3150 is indeed greater than 9000. It is indeed greater than 9000. This over here is 9150 which is indeed greater than 9000. So yes, he can achieve his goal by uploading eight cat videos and seven dog videos.",math_algebra_inequalities-systems-graphs
" Last video, we saw what happens when we have resistors in series. Now let's see what happens when we have resistors in parallel. All right, let me pick a new color. New color will be magenta. There's my battery: positive, negative. There's my ideal conducting wire. Here's my ideal conducting wire, but then-- and this is new-- it branches off, and I have two resistances. I have one here. And that's another resistance. And let's say that this has a resistance R1, this has a resistance R2. And, of course, the non-intuitive convention is that the current flows from the positive to the negative terminal, but we know that the electrons are actually flowing in the other direction. And I want to keep saying that, because I think it's so important to understand what's actually happening as opposed to the convention. Well, anyway, in the previous video, we said, well, when we have devices or components in series, that the current through the entire circuit is constant. But let's think about what happens here. So we have these electrons-- actually, let's think about it from the electron flow. The electrons are flowing, flowing, flowing at a given rate, and then here they have a choice. Some of them can take this top path, some of them can take this bottom path. So if you think about it, the flow of electrons in this branch plus the flow of electrons in that branch have to add up to the flow of the electrons in this branch, right? And then they're going to meet back up, and then the flow of electrons here-- so if we think of it this way, and now I'm going to go back to the convention, this is I1. So you have these electrons flowing at a given rate. This is the current right here. They're going to branch off, and maybe half of them go-- we'll see if the resistances are equal, if both of these branches have an equal amount of capacity in terms of how fast the electrons can flow through. If they're equal, or since we're going to current in this direction, let's talk about positrons or positive charges. If the positive charges-- although I just want to keep saying that it is not the positive charges that are moving. It's the electrons. But if you say that the lack of electrons can flow equally easily between both paths, that's if the resistances were the same, we could imagine that the current, the flow, would split itself up, and then over here would meet back up. And then we would say that the current here would also be I1. But let's figure out where the current's going. Let's call this current I2 and let's call this current I3. So I think it is reasonable, and you can imagine with water pipes or anything, that the current going into the branch is equal to the current exiting the branch. Or you could even think of it that the current entering-- when the currents I2 and I1 merge, that they combine and they become Current 1, right? I mean, think about it. In a given second, if this is 5 coulombs per second-- I'm just making up numbers-- and this is 6 coulombs per second, in a given second right here, you're going to have 5 coulombs coming from this branch and 6 coulombs coming from this branch, so you're going to have 11 coulombs per second coming out once they've merged, so this would be 11 coulombs per second. So I think hopefully that makes sense to you that this current is equal to the combination of this current and that current. Now, what do we also know? We also know the voltage along this entire ideal wire is constant, so then voltage-- let me draw that in another color, in blue. So, for example, the voltage anywhere along this blue that I'm filling in is going to be the same, because this wire is an ideal conductor, and you can almost view this blue part as an extension of the positive terminal of the battery. And very similarly-- I'll do it in yellow-- we could draw this wire as an extension of the negative terminal of the battery. This is an extension of the negative terminal of the battery. So the voltage difference between here and here-- so let's call that the total voltage, or let's just call it the voltage, right? The voltage difference between that point and that point is the exact same thing as the voltage difference between this point and this point, which is the exact same thing as the voltage difference between this point and this point. So what can we say? What is the total current in the system? If we just viewed this as a black box, that this is some type of total resistance, well, the total current in the system would be the total voltage, the voltage divided by-- let's call this our total resistance, right? Let's say we couldn't see this and we just said, oh, that's just some total resistance, and that is equal to the current going through R1. This is I1. This is a 1 right here. This is current I1. What's current I1? Well, it's going to be the voltage across this resistor divided by the resistance, right? That's what Ohm's law tells us: V is equal to IR, or another way we could say it is V over R is equal to I, right? So I1 is equal to the voltage across this resistor, but we just said that voltage is the same thing as this voltage, right? The voltage here is the same thing as the voltage here. The voltage here is the same thing as the voltage here. So the voltage across that resistor is still V, and so the current flowing across that resistor is V over R1. And the same logic: what is I2? I2 is this current. What is the voltage across this device? Well, that's just V again, right? It's the same thing as the voltage across this device, so it's V over R2 by Ohm's law. Well, all these V's are the same, so we can divide both sides of that equation by V, and we get 1 over the total resistance is equal to 1 over R1 plus 1 over R2. And you could make that argument if we had an R3 here. Let's say that we had another device, and that is R3. You could use the exact same argument, and you would have a plus 1 over R3. And if you had Rn or 10 of them, you'd just keep that 1 over R4, R5, et cetera. So let's see if we can use this information we have learned to actually solve a problem, and I actually find that it's always easier to solve a problem than to explain the theory behind a problem. You'll see that with most of these circuit problems, it's actually very basic mathematics. So let's say I have a 16 volt battery plus, minus, it's 16 volts. And just to hit the point home that you always don't have to draw circuits the same, although it is nice if you're actually drawing complicated circuits, I could draw it like this. I could draw the circuit like this, and let's say that there's a resistor here. And then let's say there's a wire and then there's another resistor here, and that this decides to do some random loopy thing here and that they connect here, and that they come back here. This strange thing that I have drawn, which you will never see in any textbook, because most people are more reasonable than me, is the exact same-- you can almost view it topologically as the exact same circuit as what I drew in the previous diagram, although now I will assign numbers to it. Let's say that this resistance is 20 ohms and let's say that this resistance is 5 ohms. What I want to know is, what is the current through the system? First, we'll have to figure out what the equivalent resistance is, and then we could just use Ohm's law to figure out the current in the system. So we want to know what the current is, and we know that the convention is that current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. So how do we figure out the equivalent resistance? Well, we know that we just hopefully proved to you that the total resistance is equal to 1 over this resistor plus 1 over this resistor. So 1 over-- I won't keep writing it. What's 1 over 20? Well, actually, let's just make it a fraction. So it's 1/20 plus-- 1/5 is what over 20? That's 4/20, right? So 1 over our total resistance is equal to 5/20, which is equal to what? 1/4. So if 1/R is equal to 1/4, R must be equal to 4. R is equal to 4 ohms. So we could redraw this crazy circuit as this. I'll try to draw it small down here. We could redraw this where this resistance is 4 ohms and this is 16 volts. We could say that this whole thing combined is really just a resistor that is 4 ohms. Well, if we have a 16-volt potential difference, current is flowing that way, even though that's not what the electrons are doing. And that's what our resistance is, 4 ohms. What is the current? 1V equals IR, Ohms law. 1The voltage is 16 volts. 1It equals the current times 4 ohms. So current is equal to 116 divided by 4, is equal to 4 amps. 1So let's do something interesting. 1Let's figure out what the current is flowing through. 1What's this? 1What's the current I1 and what's this current I2? 1Well, we know that the potential difference from here 1to here is also 16 volts, right? 1Because this whole thing is essentially at the same 1potential and this whole thing is essentially at the same 1potential, so you have 16 volts across there. 116 volts divided by 20 ohms, so let's call this I1. 1So I1 is equal to 16 volts divided by 20 ohms, which is 1equal to what? 14/5. 1So it equals 4/5 of an ampere, or 0.8 amperes. 1And similarly, what is the amount of current flowing 1through here? 1I2? 1I'm going to do this in a different color. 1It's getting confusing. 1I'll do it in the vibrant yellow. 1So the current flowing through here, once again, the 1potential difference from here-- that's not different 1enough-- the potential difference from here to here 1is also 16 volts, right? 1So the current is going to be I2, is going to be equal to 116/5, which is equal to 3 1/5 amps. 1So most of the current is actually flowing through this, 1and that makes sense because the resistance is less, right? 1So that should hopefully give you a little bit of intuition 1of what's going on. 1And less current is flowing through here, so I2 through 1the 20-ohm resistor is 0.8 amps is I1, and I2 through the 15-ohm resistor is equal to 3.2 amps. 1And it makes sense that when you add these two currents 1together, the 3.2 amperes flowing through here and the 10.8 amperes flowing through here, that when they merge, 1they merge and then you have 4 amperes flowing through there. 1Anyway, hopefully, I have given you some intuition on 1what happens when we put resistors in parallel. 1I will see you in the next video.",science_physics_circuits-topic
" -  Let f of x equal negative x squared plus a x plus b over x squared plus c x plus d where a, b, c, and d are unknown constants. Which of the following is a possible graph of y is equal to f of x? And they told us dashed lines indicate asymptotes. So this is really interesting here. And they gave us four choices. We see four of them, three of them right now. Then if I scroll over bit over, you can see choice D. And so I encourage you to pause the video and think about how we can figure it out because it is interesting because they haven't given us a lot of details. They haven't given us what these coefficients or these constants are going to be. All right, now let's think about it. So one thing we could think about is horizontal asymptotes. So let's think about what happens as x approaches positive or negative infinity. Well, as x, so as x approaches infinity or x approaches negative infinity, f of x. F of x is going to be approximately equal to. Well, we're going to look at the highest degree terms because these are going to dominate as the magnitude of x, the absolute value of x becomes very large. So f of x is going to be approximately negative x squared over x squared which is equal to negative or we could another way to think about it. This is the same thing as negative one. So f of x is going to approach, f of x is going to approach negative one. In either direction, as x approaches infinity or x approaches negative infinity. So we have a horizontal asymptote at y equals negative one. Let's see, choice A here, it does look like they have a horizontal asymptote at y is equal to negative one right over there. And we can verify that because each hash mark is two. We go from two to zero to negative two to negative four. So this does look like it's a negative one. So just based only on the horizontal asymptote, choice A looks good. Choice B, we have a horizontal asymptote at y is equal to positive two. So we can rule that out. We know that a horizontal asymptote as x approaches positive or negative infinity is at negative one, y equals negative one. Here, our horizontal asymptote is at y is equal to zero. The graph approaches, it approaches the x axis from either above or below. So it's not the horizontal asymptote. It's not y equals negative one. So we can rule that one out. And then similarly, over here, our horizontal asymptote is not y equals negative one. Our horizontal asymptote is y is equal to zero so we can rule that one out. And that makes sense because really they only gave us enough information to figure out the horizontal asymptote. They didn't give us enough information to figure out how many roots or what happens in the interval and all of those types of things. How many zeros and all that because we don't know what the actual coefficients or constants of the quadratic are. All we know is what happens as the x squared terms dominate. This thing is going to approach negative one. And so we picked choice A.",math_algebra2_rational
" -  If you up all of the spots on these dominoes, there are 63 spots. So if you counted all of these dots, they're telling us that would be 63. So we don't have to do that. And then they tell us, that is 42 more spots than the total number of spots on a six sided die. So they're saying if you took a six sided die, so a six sided die, might look something like this. It's a cube, it might have one dot and then it might have three and then over here it might have maybe two and so if you count up all of these dots, the ones we see and then the ones on the other side as well, that's the number of spots on a six sided die. Now what they're saying is that the 63 spots, they said if you add up all the spots on these dominoes there is 63. And they're saying that is 42 more spots than the total number of spots on a six sided die. Let's now figure out how many spots are on a six sided die. The first thing you should always ask yourselves is what they're asking for. Is this going to be more or less than the number of spots that you have on these dominoes? You might say, ""Hey, I'm reading 42 more ""I see this word more, there must be 42 more spots."" But you have to be very, very, very, very careful. Whenever you do a word problem, don't just look for words and say ""Oh it's more I'll add or if it's fewer I'll subtract."" Because that's not going to be the case always. You really need to think about what is the problem asking for? Because they're saying that this 63 dots right over here that is 42 more than the total number of spots on a six sided die. Another way of thinking about it is, if you took the number of spots on a six sided die that's what they're asking for. So if we say that's question mark. If you took the number of spots on a six sided die and you had 42 more than that, then that is going to be equal to the number of spots on these dominoes and they tell us that is 63. The number of spots on a six sided die plus 42 is 63 or 63 spots is 42 more spots than the total number of spots on a six sided die. Always think about what they're saying. So now we can try to figure out what this question mark is. Well if question mark plus 42 is equal to 63, that's the same thing as saying that question mark is equal to 63, 63 minus 42. So what's that going to be? We can calculate it. So 63, six tens three ones. 42, four tens and two ones. We want to subtract that, and when we do we're going to figure out the number of spots on the six sided die. We'll go to ones place, three ones minus two ones is one one. Six tens minus four tens, those are two tens. So two tens and one one that's 21 spots. 21 spots on a six sided die.",math_cc-2nd-grade-math_cc-2nd-add-subtract-100
" - In the past 40 wonderful weeks together we've explored all of the fundamentals of biology. From the tiny little machines that make us work to the systems that power the most awe-inspiring and most complex organisms on Earth. Now, I wanna take our learning to the next level. Simply, by broadening our perspective. With a solid understanding of biology at the small scale under our belts, it's time for the long view. For the next 12 weeks, we'll be learning how the living things that we've studied interact and influence each other and their environments. It's the science of ecology. The idea of an organism interacting with its environment may sound simple but it's actually pretty marvelously complicated. Nothing escapes the long arm of ecology. Life influences the chemical makeup of the atmosphere, the geology of the planet, the climate. Nothing impacts life on Earth today more than humanity does. And so we're gonna be exploring that relationship, between mankind and our environment in a lot of detail in the coming weeks. Life, is powerful. And in order to understand how living systems work, you first have to understand how they originated, and developed, and diversified over the past 4.5 billion years of Earth's history. The principles that you hear about today will form the framework of our next 12 weeks together. Get ready, for the epic drama that is the history of life on Earth. (upbeat music) Earth is like a cheap rental house in a college town. There's always somebody living there, but tets are always moving in and out. And new tets moving into old ones' rooms and sometimes the electricity gets turned off because nobody paid the power bill. It's pretty much just chaos. And like a rental house, the Earth isn't invincible. I mean a good semester of back-to-back frat parties can tear a house up pretty fast. And then you know everybody gets evicted. And some new tets move in. Which gives you a little bit of perspective on humanity's position as the current domit species on the planet. There have been others before us and there will probably be others when we're gone. That's just how the planet rolls. But it's taken eons for the Earth to get the way that it is today. Earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago and for a while it was a chunk of rock circling the sun suffering collisions with other chunks of rock, generating unreal amounts of heat. Eventually the constant smashing slowed down a little bit and the outer layer of the Earth cooled but the core of the planet remained hot. Like really hot, as hot as the surface of the Sun. It gives you some ideas to how much energy and radiation contributed to the Earth's formation. When you consider that 4.5 billion years later, there's still molten stuff in the middle of our planet. And it's that inner heat that makes the Earth's surface so dynamic. The planet's insides have been continually bubbling up, destroying what's there. Renovating, and rearranging furniture. It's this constant renewal that's part of what makes life here possible. And in the scheme of things, it didn't actually take life very long to show up on that hot rock. About 4.4 billion years ago the planet was still getting pelted with giant chunks of rock and ice leftover from the formation of the solar system. There was no oxygen in the atmosphere and volcanoes were firing off all over the place. But, it was finally cool enough for some of the water in the atmosphere to turn from vapor into liquid. The first seas formed and in them, and in the atmosphere, a soup of chemicals. Nitrogen, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide. All those things that with the help of heat and lightning and who knows what else eventually created small organic molecules. In some way, somehow, life happened. We don't know how it happened, I wish we did but we don't. The first life on Earth probably wasn't even life as we think of it. It was just a collection of chemicals surrounded by a membrane. Because phospholipids as you may remember, spontaneously form bilayer membranes in water. Over time, some of the chemicals inside these membranes developed into amino acids and eventually, RNA, the nuclei acid that was probably the first genetic material. These collections of chemicals trapped within membranes called protobionts most likely began to grow and split and replicate themselves until some crazy copying error gave way to DNA nucleotides. Which is a way more stable repository for genetic information because it's double stranded, not single stranded like RNA. And once these little guys had DNA, they were on their way. They might only have been one cell and they were probably living in the equivalent of a hydrothermal vent, but they were making the most of it. So the first living thing were prokaryotes, single celled organisms with no nuclei that were probably pretty similar to the archaea that we find living today in hydrothermal vents, sulfur hot springs, and oil wells. And I apologize for pronouncing archaea wrong for the entire biology series, my bad. These prokaryotes probably made their grand entrance between 3.9 and 3.5 billion years ago. During what is known as the Archaean Eon. This is the first of what scientists would identify as three eons in Earth's history. The Archean, the Proterozoic and the Phanerozoic. The Phanerozoic being what we've been experiencing for the last half billion years or so. An eon, as you might expect, takes freaking forever. The first one went on for 2.5 billion years. So we break up the eons into eras, periods and epochs which are organized by the big-deal-events that we can see in the fossil record. So from 3.5 billion years ago until about 2.1 billion years ago, these prokaryotes were all alone on Earth. But then, something weird happened. The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere suddenly shot up, basically from none to 10% in a very short period of time, geologically speaking. This oxygen was most likely produced by a brand new prokaryote, called cyanobacteria which had figured out how to make its own food through photosynthesis. The more cyanobacteria were out there, the higher the atmospheric concentration of oxygen became. This Oxygen Revolution, as it's called probably spelled D-double-O-M for a lot of prokaryotes out there that had evolved without oxygen. And this was also one of the first real game-changers for life on Earth. Because it was the first major instance of living things bringing massive change to their own environment. In fact, it may be the earliest example of ecology at work. Cyanobacteria changed the atmosphere, judo-chopped the competition and made way for the evolution of living things to take a new, specific direction. Then, about 2.1 billion years ago a new kind of organism made its big debut. Eukaryotes. These, as you know, are a big deal because they include all plants and animals. Eukaryotes probably evolved via a process called endosymbiosis. Where one prokaryote parasitisized another prokaryote or may just ate it but forgot to digest it. And the result was actually really awesome for both the host and the parasite/undigested prey. It formed a single-celled organism with organelles. Specifically, mitochondria and plastids which probably evolved from those eaten or parasitic prokaryotes. This allowed for much more complextiy. And by 1.5 billion years ago we start seeing multicellular eukaryotic organisms in the fossil record. The very first of them probably being algae. But it wasn't until around 535 million years ago that the eukaryotes went berserk. And that's known as the Cambrian Explosion. A super, major, biological golden age when the diversity of all animal life on earth exploded. Nobody's entirely sure what started it but suddenly life created innovations that the planet had never seen. Creatures used minerals in sea water to build skeletons and shells. Some acquired weapons like claws, while others developed defensive plates. The evolutionary arms race between predators and prey was underway. This heralded the dawn of the Phanerozoic Eon, the one that we're in right now. That's right, the Earth spent the better part of two eons under the rule of a bunch of archaea and bacteria and some like, soft-bodied worms until the Cambrian exploded and we see a lot of animal phyla that we actually are hanging out with today. After the Cambrian the party got so hot in the oceans that by the Ordovician Period, around 500 million years ago, plants, animals and fungi started colonizing land. Probably as a strategy for escaping predation. Now there were whole new ecosystems to explore, and adapt to, and create. During the Devonian Period, about 365 million years ago, tetrapods, four-legged vertebrates that probably evolved from lobed-finned fishes showed up on land. And so did arthropods like insects and spiders. From here we begin to see ecological systems that we recognize today. Because organisms were changing their environments by consuming oxygen in the atmosphere, and releasing carbon dioxide. And you know who likes carbon dioxide, the plants. The Carboniferous Period that extended from 359 to 299 million years ago was when the plants entirely went nuts. The forests were so dense and so widespread that they made all our fossil fuels, all the coal and oil that we now use to power all the things with were made over the course of about 60 million years. This time it was the plants that had changed both the climate and the geology of Earth. These forests cranked out so much oxygen that the atmosphere contained around 35% oxygen, rather than today's like, 21%. All this oxygen started cooling the planet, because there wasn't enough carbon dioxide to maintain the balmy temperatures that the vast Carboniferous jungles needed to survive. So, the whole system crashed and all the carbon from these forests sunk into swamps and eventually got locked in rocks. Of course, now we're releasing all of that carbon by burning fossil fuels, which is certainly helping to keep the planet toasty now. That right there, some good ecology. In the Permian Period, 299 to 251 million years ago, all the land masses of the world joined to form one giant continent that we call Pangaea. Altering global climate and ocean currents and animals and plants evolved in response. We started seeing gymnosperms, the first plants with seeds like modern pines, and spruces, and firs. And archosaurs, the granddaddies of dinosaurs and modern birds showed up. But you probably picked up enough of the pattern here to predict that this party didn't last forever. About 252 million years ago, something happened. Or maybe a lot of things happened in quick succession. But whatever they were, movie executives take note. The Permian-Triassic extinction event would make the most awesome disaster film of all time. Because up to 96% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species bought the farm. And it's the only known mass extinction of insects. 1About 57% of all taxonomic families 1and 83% of all genera became extinct. 1It was the most significant extinction event 1on the planet ever. 1It's been hard to pinpoint 1the reason for this extinction event, 1because most of the evidence have been wiped out, 1of course. 1It may have been kicked off by an asteroid 1that released the energy equivalent of the detonation 1of a few million nuclear weapons all at once. 1And then insult added to injury 1when a whole bunch of volcanoes erupted, 1methane was released from the seafloor. 1There were probably some gas explosions 1in what's now Siberia. 1And then a whole lot of climate changes, 1sea level change, and changes in ocean salinity 1probably occurred. 1Nobody's sure exactly what happened. 1But we do know that it took a long time 1for life on Earth to make a comeback. 1But look at the bright side, 1as a result of the Permian-Triassic event, 1we got dinosaurs. 1They were able to evolve during the Triassic 1because there wasn't much competition for resources. 1so they evolved to fill an available niche. 1That is a combination of living and non-living resources 1that they could use to survive. 1Remember that word, because a lot of ecology 1comes down to who's exploting, or leaving, 1or getting kicked out of, or altering their niches. 1And during the Triassic Period, 1there were tons of niches. 1The sky was the limit, 1because hey, there weren't very many animals or plants 1to compete with. 1So by the Jurassic Period 1about 199 million years ago to 145 million years ago, 1huge, herbivorous dinosaurs were roaming the Earth. 1Smaller, mean-as-crap, carnivorous dinos 1were stalking the herbivores. 1The oceans were full of giant squid and ichthyosaurs, 1and long-neck plesiosaurs. 1The air was full of pterosaurs and the first birds. 1And there were mammals! 1Small ones, but they were all over the place. 1It just wasn't our time to shine. 1The Jurassic was dino time and the dinos lived it up. 1They partied down until about 165 million years ago 1when they all went extinct, as I'm sure you're aware. 1Except for their surviving descendants, the birds. 1It was probably an asteroid that hit 1the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico that did them in. 1But other theories suggest it could have been climate change 1due to increased volcanic activity. 1And the possibility that they just couldn't adapt to changes 1in other living things around them. 1For instance, about 100 million years ago, 1angiosperms, or flowering plants, first appeared. 1And they did really well. 1Especially since flying insects evolved with them. 1Providing a great vehicle for reproduction. 1This is another great example 1of another ecological principle, 1coevolution. 1But dinosaurs liked to eat the old-fashioned gymnosperms. 1We know that from studying their fossilized poop. 1So maybe their pickiness made them go extinct, who knows? 1And with the dinosaurs out of the picture, 1mammals and birds were free to take over. 1And this is where the flora and fauna on planet Earth 1started looking a lot more like they do today. 1Since then, there have been climate fluctuations 1and extinction events. 1And the evolution of many animals and plants, 1including humans. 1And on a geological scale, oddly enough, 1that kind of brings us up to today. 1Ecology is all about action and reaction. 1An asteroid hits and a bunch of stuff happens 1because of it. 1Plants take over 1and different stuff happens because of that. 1Humans start releasing all the carbon dioxide 1locked in 300 million year old rocks 1and the planet heats up 1and you know, we don't know what happens. 1But ecology is providing us our best guesses. 1Over the next three months, 1we're gonna explore these relationships 1in more and more detail. 1As well as like, how humans relate to the whole thing, 1and how we're affecting all of this.",science_biology_crash-course-bio-ecology
" -  Hello everyone. So I'm talking about how to find the tangent plane to a graph. And I think the first step of that is to just figure out how we control planes in three dimensions in the first place. So what I have pictured here is a red dot representing a point in three dimensions, and the coordinates of that point, easily enough are one two three. So the x coordinate is one, the y coordinate's two and the z coordinate is three. And then I have a plane that passes through it. And the goal of the video is going to be to find a function, a function that I'll call l, that takes in a two dimensional input x and y and this function l should have this plane as it's graph. Now the first thing to notice is that there's lots of different planes that could be passing through this point, right? At the moment it's one that's got a certain kind of angle, you could think of it going up in one direction, but you could give this a lot of different directions, and get a lot of different planes, that all pass through that one point. So we're going to need to find some way of distinguishing the specific one that we're looking at, which is this one right here, from other possible planes that can pass through it. And as we work through you'll see how this is done in terms of partial derivatives. But as we are getting our head around what the formula for this graph can be, let's just start observing properties that it has. The first property is that the graph actually passes through this point, one, two, three. And what that means in terms of functions over here, is that if you evaluated at the point one two, the input pair where both x is one and y is two, then it should equal three. It should equal three because that's telling you that when you go x equals one and y equals two and then you say what's the height of the graph above that point, it should be the z coordinate at the end of the desired point. So this right here is the fact number one, that we can take into consideration. And beyond that, let's start thinking about what makes planes, what makes these kind of flat graphs, different from the sort of curvy graphs that you might be used to in other multi-variable function. The main idea is that if you intersect it with another plane, so here I'm going to intersect it with y equals two, this kind of constant plane, and so I'll go ahead and write that down. That plane that you're looking at, is y equals two. And you can think of this as representing, what is movement in the x direction look like. As we move along the x direction, this kind of has a slope. The two planes intersect along a line, and that's one of the crucial features of a plane, is that if you intersect it with another plane, you just get a straight line, meaning the slope is constant, as you move in the x direction. But it's also constant, that same slope, if you move in the y direction. If I had chosen a different plane. If instead I had chosen y equals one, which looks like this, then you get a line with the same slope. And no matter what constant value of y you choose, it's always intersecting that plane, with a line that has the same slope. And now if you look back to the videos on partial derivatives, and in particular on how you interpret the partial derivative of a function, with respect to it's graph, what this is telling you is that when we take the partial derivative of l with respect to x, because constant y means you are moving in the x direction, this should just be some kind of constant. Some kind of constant a. I'll kind of emphasize that that is a constant value here. And the same goes in the other direction, right. Let's say instead of intersecting it with constant values of y, we say well what if you intersected it with a constant value of x, like x equals one. Well in that case what you should get, 'cos you're intersecting it with a plane, is another straight line, so these two planes are intersecting along a straight line, which means as you move in the y direction, this slope won't change. But also as you move in the x direction, if you imaginee slicing it with a bunch of different planes, all representing different constant values of x, you would be getting a line with that same slope. And that's telling you another powerful fact. The partial derivative of l, with respect to y, now if you're moving in the y direction, that's equal to some other constant, that I'm going to call b. And now, keep in mind, these are very powerful statements, because the partial derivative of l with respect to x is a function, this is a function of x and y, and that might actually be worth emphasizing here, that the partial derivative of x with respect to y is something that you evaluate at a point in two dimensional space. And we're saying that that's equal to some kind of constant value. Now that's a pretty powerful thing right? Because it's telling you, it's giving you control over the function at all possible input points, for movement in a specified direction. And the same goes over here. This is telling you that. A function is constantly equal to some value b, and we're not sure what this value b is. But just geometrically we can estimate what these things should be. So if I take back the plane representing a constant y value, and we say what's the slope, you're moving in the x direction, we've got a constant y value, what is the slope at which this plane intersects our graph? I would estimate this as about the slope of two. You know you go over one and it goes up two. So what that would tell you is that, at least in the specific graph we're looking at, this is at least approximately equal to two. And then similarly if we look at constant x value, and we say that represents movement in the y direction, what is the slope there. This looks to me like about one, as a slope. You kind of move over one unit you go up one unit. So I'd say down here that the constant value of the partial derivative with respect to y is about equal to one. So we have three different facts here, the value of the function at the point of one two, the value of its partial derivative with respect to x everywhere, and the partial derivative with respect to y, everywhere. And this information is actually going to be enough to tell us what the function as a whole should equal. Now specifically, this idea that the partial derivative with respect to x is constant, tells us that the function l of xy is going to equal two times x plus something that doesn't have any x's in it, something that as far as x is concerned is constant, because the only thing whose derivative, with respect to x, is the constant two is two x plus something that's constant, as far as x is concerned. And then similarly over here, if the partial with respect to y is the constant one, then that tells you that the whole function looks like this looks like a constant as far as y is concerned. So once we bring in y, it's going to be one times y plus something that's constant, as far as y is concerned. You know this part is already constant, as far as y is concerned, so anything that I add beyond here has to be constant as far as both x and y is concerned. So that part has to actually literally be a constant. So I'm just going to put in c for that, to represent constant. So, you can see this is a very restricted property on our function, because the only place x can show up is this linear term and the only place y can show up is as this linear term. And when I use the word linear, you can pretty much interpret as saying the term x shows up without an exponent or without anything fancy happening to it. It's just x times a constant, that's pretty much what I mean by linear. It's got more precise formulations in other contexts, but as far as we're concerned here, you can just think of it as meaning variable times a constant. So the question is what should this c be. And you can imagine that we can, based on this property, based on the value at the point one two, we can uniquely determine c. And you can plug in, x equals one, y equals two, know that this has to equal three and solve for c. Which we could do but I'm going to actually do something a little bit more convenient. I'm going to kind of shift around where the constants show up, and I'm going to say that the whole function should equal two times and then I'm going to put a constant in with the x, I'm going to say x minus one, and then I'm going to do the same thing with y, and I'm going to say plus one, here is the partial derivative with respect to y, y minus and then I'm going to say two. And the reason I'm doing this, notice this doesn't change the partial derivative information, it's just if we take the partial derivative with respect to x, this will still be two, and when we take it with respect to y, this will still be one. But the reason I'm putting these in here, is because we're gonna evaluate it at the point one two so I want to make it look as easy as possible to evaluate at the point one two. And then from here I'm just going to add another constant, so instead of saying c because this is going to be slightly different from c, I'll call it k. But the idea is that I'm just moving around constants. If you imagined distributing the multiplication here, and having two times that negative one, and one times that negative two, you're just changing what the value of the constant stuck on the end here is. Now the important part, the reason that I'm writing it this way, which is only slightly different, is because then when I evaluate this, at l of one two, this whole first part, cancels out because plugging in x equals one means this whole part goes to zero. Same with the second part, because when I plug in y equals two, this part goes to zero. So k this other constant, that I'm tagging on the end, is going to completely specify what happens when I evaluate this at the point one two. And of course I want it to be the case, when I evaluate at one two I get three. I want it to be the case when I evaluate at one two, I get three. So that tells me, that this constant k here should just equal 3. So notice the way that I've written the function here, is actually quite powerful. We have a lot of control. This term two was telling us the slope with respect to x. So when you moved purely in the x direction, and that was kind of illustrated here, purely in the x direction, that's telling us the slope with respect to x, and then this term one here, was telling us the slope with respect to y. So when we moved purely in the y direction, that's telling us the slope there. And we could just turn those knobs if we change the two and we change the one, that's what's going to allow us to basically change what the slopes of the plane are. I'm going to say slopes plural because it's with respect to the x and the y direction. And that will give us control of various different planes that pass through. If I'm looking at the one right here, then the movement in the y direction is very shallow, so that would be turning this knob lower, and instead of one it might be point zero one. And if I were looking at movement in the x direction, 1you know this looks actually negative. 1So this would tell you that it's going to be 1some kind of negative number. 1So you can kind of dial these knobs and that changes 1the different planes that pass through that same point. 1And then, plugging in this one two and three, 1tells us what point we're specifying. 1We're basically saying when you input x equals one, 1and you input y equals 2, 1the whole thing should equal three. 1So this form right here's is powerful enough that 1I want you to remember it for the next video. 1I want you to remember the idea of writing things down 1in this way where you specify 1the point its passing through 1with it's x coordinate y coordinate and z coordinate, 1placed where they are, 1and then you tweak the slopes, using these coefficients 1out front. 1So with that, I will see you next video.",math_multivariable-calculus_applications-of-multivariable-derivatives
" We're asked to construct a 10 degree angle. So we have this little angle tool here that we can use to construct an angle. So just like that. And then they give us a protractor to actually measure the angle. So let's set it up. Let's put the protractor here. Let's put the vertex of the angle at the center of the protractor, in other words, center the protractor at the center of the vertex. Looks like the protractor's a little bit easier to manipulate. So let's do that there. Now let's put one of the rays here at 0 degrees. And now I'm going to put the other ray at 10 degrees. And it looks like I am done. I have constructed a 10 degree angle. And you want to be careful here when you use this tool because the angle in question-- let me move the protractor show you what I'm talking about-- that this right over here is the angle that we're talking about. If I'd switched these two rays, the way the tool is set up, it might have interpreted the angle as this outer angle right over here. So be careful to look at which angle we're actually measuring. But this looks like I did the 10 degree angle. So let me check my answer. And just to be clear what I'm talking about. If you did the 10 degree angle like this, then it definitely would have marked it wrong even though the interior angle right over here or this angle right here might be 10 degrees. The way the tool is set up, you see from this circle, that it thinks that you're looking at this outer angle. So it's important to make sure, at least for the sake of this exercise, that the system, that the computer program knows which angle you're going to talk about. Let's do one more of these. 155 degree angle. And this one's interesting because this is an obtuse angle. So once again, let us put the protractor at the vertex of the angle. So just like that. And now that seems pretty good. Now let's take one ray and put it at 0 degrees, and then let's take the other one and put it at 155. So once again, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90-- that gets us to a right angle. Then we'll start getting into obtuse angles, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150. And just to make sure that blue arc is measuring this angle right over here, not the outer one. And let me move the protractor out of the way so we can get a good look at it. And we got it wrong. So let's see what we-- oh, 155 degree angle, not 150 degree angle. Let me fix that. 155 degree angle. Now we got it right.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_imp-geometry-2
" -  Let's see if we can calculate what 5/6 plus 1/4 is, and to help us, I have a visual representation of 5/6, and a visual representation of 1/4. Notice I have this whole whole, I guess you could say, broken up into one, two, three, four, five, six sections, and we've shaded in five of them, so this is 5/6, and then down here, we have another whole, and we have one out of the four equal sections shaded in so this is 1/4, and I want to add them, and I encourage you at any point, pause the video, and see if you could figure it out on your own. Well, whenever we're adding fractions, we like to think in terms of fractions that have the same denominator, and these clearly don't have the same denominator, but in order to rewrite them, with a common denominator, we just have to think of a common multiple of six and four, and ideally, the smallest common multiple of six and four, and the way that I like to do that is I like to take the larger of the two, which is six, and then think about its multiples. So I could first think about six itself. Six is clearly divisible by six, but it's not perfectly divisible by four, so now, let's multiply by two, so then we get to 12. 12 is divisible by both six and four. So 12 is a good common denominator here. It's the least common multiple of six and four. So we can rewrite both of these fractions as something over 12. So, something over 12 plus something, plus something over 12 is equal to. Now, there's a bunch of ways to tackle it, but what I want to do is I just want to visualize it here on this drawing. So, if I go, if I were to go from, if I were to go from six equal sections to 12 equal sections, which is what I'm doing if I'm going from six in the denominator to 12 in the denominator. I'm essentially multiplying each of these sections by, or, I'm essentially multiplying the number of sections I have by two, or I'm taking each of these existing sections and I'm turning them into two sections, so let's do that. Let's do that. Let me see if I can do it pretty neatly, so, I can do it a little bit neater than that. So, it'll look like that. And, whoops. Let me do this one. I want to divide them fairly close to evenly. I'm doing it by eye so it's not going to be perfect. So, and you have that one. And then last not, last but not least, you have that one there, and then notice, I had six sections, but now I've doubled the number of sections. I've turned the six sections into 12 sections by turning each of the original six into two, so now I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12 sections. So if I have 12 sections now, how many of those 12 are now shaded in? Instead of having five of the six, I now have 10 of the 12 that are shaded in. So I now have 10/12. 5/6 is the same thing as 10/12. Another way you could have thought about that, to go from six to 12, I had to multiply by two, so then I have to do the same thing in the numerator. Five times two is 10. But hopefully you see that those two fractions are equivalent, that I didn't change how much is shaded in, I just took each of the original six and I turned it into two, or I multiplied the total number of sections by two to get 12, and then instead of having 5/6, I now have 10/12 shaded in. Now let's do the same thing with the four, with the 1/4. Right here, I've depicted 1/4, but I want to turn this into something over 12. So to turn it into something over 12, each section has to be turned into three sections. So let's do that. Let's turn each section into three sections. So, that's one, two, and three. So then I have one, two, and three. I have, I think you can see where this is going. One, two and three. I have one, two, and three. And so notice, all I did is I multiplied, before I had four equal sections. Now I turned each of those four sections into three sections, so now I have 12 equal sections. And I did that, essentially, by multiplying the number of sections I had by three. So now what fraction is shaded in? Well, now, this original that was one out of the four, we can now see is three out of the 12 equal sections. It's now three out of the 12 equal sections, and so what is this going to be? Well, if I have 10/12, and I'm adding it to 3/12, well how many twelfths do I have? I'm going to have 13/12. And you could see it visually over here as well. Up here in green, I have 10/12 shaded in. Each of these boxes are a twelfth. Let me write that down. Each of these boxes are 1/12. That's 1/12. This is 1/12. So how many twelfths do I have shaded in? I have the 10 that are shaded in in green, and then I have an 11/12, a 12/12 and then finally, the 13/12 is one way to think about it.",math_pre-algebra_pre-algebra-fractions
" -  So in the next couple of videos, we're going to talk about myeloproliferative disorders. Myeloproliferative disorders. This group of diseases involves the bone marrow because that's what myelo means. It's just a term for the bone marrow. And in this group of disorders, you are proliferating, you are proliferating or you are making too much bone marrow. Now to be clear, there are a lot of things that we make in the bone marrow, so I've drawn a bone right here. This is your standard femur and the marrow is usually located in the shaft of long bones like the femur or maybe the humerus or even in your vertebral bodies in the spinal column. But we'll use this as an example right here. The bone marrow makes all of the blood cells in our blood stream, and it all starts from a single precursor that's known as a pluripotent. Pluri meaning almost the same thing as plural, so many potency in making hematopoietic, hematopoietic, which you might recognize as the same sound as the term hematology, which is the study of blood, stem cells. So pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells are cells within the bone marrow that have the ability to make all different types of blood cells that we find in the blood stream. So I'll draw one of them right here, and let's go through and make a quick chart of all the different types of blood cells that we can have. There's one key lineage up there and I'll draw another one down here that's gonna be less important for these disorders we're about to talk about. Both of these are also stem cells, so I'll code them both in yellow. Up here we're talking about the myeloid stem cells. This is the myeloid stem cell which is why it's most relevant for the type of disorders we're about to talk about. Whereas down here we are talking about the lymphoid stem cell. The lymphoid stem cell that you might recall sounds a lot like lymphocytes and that's sure enough what it produces. The lymphoid stem cell will go on to make three main types of cells over time, so I'm sort of abbreviating it here. There are many steps in between. And I'll draw them out in this color right here just to distinguish them 'cause they're not stem cells but they have a different property that I'll mention in a minute. But the lymphocytes or the lymphoid cells that you end up with are your B cells, you get some T cells as well, and in addition you also get these natural killer cells. And that's all I'll say about that lineage for now. Up here for the myeloid stem cells, there are four specific types of pathways that we go through, so I'll draw them out right here. The first type of cell that can branch off a myeloid stem cell is called a proerythroblast. A proerythroblast. And this guy will go through a whole bunch of divisions to eventually make what's referred to as a, or rather, as an erythrocyte. So this is an erythrocyte that you may more commonly refer to as a red blood corpuscle, or a red blood cell. Next down here, what we can make off the myeloid stem cell is something that's called a myeloblast. A myeloblast. And the myeloblast itself can divide into three different types of cells as well. And I'll draw them each right here, but the sizes are not going to be quite representative. I'm just trying to show them here schematically. We'll get some basophils, which you may have heard of before, eosinophils. So that's eosinophils. And finally you can also get some neutrophils. Neutrophils. Another lineage that you can have dividing off of the myeloid stem cell is through the monoblast, so a monoblast. And this guy, which you may be able to guess, will divide into this cell right here, which is known as a monocyte. And for the final lineage, I'm going to draw somewhat of a bigger cell right here because it's supposed to accommodate a bigger nucleus. This is a megakaryoblast. A megakaryoblast. Mega meaning big, karyo meaning nucleus. The megakaryoblast will divide into big megakaryocytes, so I'll write that here, megakaryocyte, and then these then will fragment. It's very unusual. It's not like the other cells we talk about above, but these cells will break apart into pieces. So there are six pieces I drew here. So there should be six pieces that come out on the other side right here. And these aren't perfect but they show that there are six pieces coming off the megakaryocyte, and each of these pieces are known as a platelet. So these are your platelets right here. And that's the gist of how you get all the different blood cells off of this single pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell in the bone marrow. Myeloproliferative disorders occur when there's a defect, so I'll write that up here. There's a defect in a receptor tyrosine kinase, which may be something you've heard of before if you're familiar with enzymes. A defect in a receptor tyrosine kinase that is responsible or involved in cell division. The activation of this receptor tyrosine kinase regulates whether cells are allowed to divide along these various lineages or if not, if they're supposed to pause until it's more appropriate for them to divide. The mutation that occurs allows this receptor tyrosine kinase to just always be on, and there are different points along the way where we can have this receptor tyrosine kinase turned on. Say if we have the mutation occurring along this path right here. That defect is associated with a myeloproliferative disorder known as polycythemia, polycythemia vera, where you have poly, meaning a lot of different cells that are produced, and so you'll get a bunch of erythrocytes, basophils, neutrophils, all of these guys, in the blood stream. Or let's say you have the defect right here, where the myeloblast branches off. In that case, you would have a disorder known as chronic myelogenous, chronic myelogenous leukemia. Chronic myelogenous leukemia. And you might recall leuk meaning white, which refers to leukocytes, which I've colored in all of these little beige colors here. All of these refer to leukocytes. This defect will produce a whole bunch of leukocytes and it'll mainly be these that we see up here through the myeloblast lineage. Or let's say we have a defect in the platelet lineage around here. We can have a disorder that's known as essential, essential thrombocythemia. Thrombocythemia. And thrombocyte, I should've mentioned this earlier when I was writing out platelets, but thrombocyte means the same thing as platelets. Or finally you could even have a defect so early on right here, before you even get to the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell. And you have what's referred to as primary myelofibrosis. Primary myelofibrosis, which you might recall as meaning fibrosis or connective tissue being put in the bone marrow, which is not where it should be. So that would be a big problem for us. And when this occurs, you'll get an additional defect known as myeloid metaplasia, which means various other organs in your body, like what I've drawn here is your liver or your spleen, will start making these hematopoietic stem cells, causing them to become really big. So your liver might end up being that big and bulge out, or your spleen could also become pretty large as well. And in fact, when you have enlargement of your liver, or what's known as hepatomegaly, or enlargement of your spleen, which is known as splenomegaly, these were things that you can also see with these other disorders that I've mentioned up here, because now they're kicked into overdrive in producing these types of cells. And not just in these organs but in other bones of the body like the skull, for instance. You can start having these hematopoietic stem cells put out these cells at a rate that they're not supposed to be, which can cause the bones to grow and produce an abnormal appearance that's very recognizable. Many of these disorders can also go on to produce what are called acute leukemias. I think we know what leukemias are already, but acute just refers to what stage of development these leukocytes will be put out into the blood stream. And acute leukemias will happen when you have a defect that occurs before the leukocytes are put out. So can you guess which of these four right here would not have an acute leukemia associated with it? I think you reasoned correctly. If you think about polycythemia vera, we have the defect here and so sure enough we can produce abnormal amounts of leukocytes. Chronic myelogenous leukemia, that's before leukocytes are produced. Primary myelofibrosis, the defect is here. That's definitely before leukocytes are produced down here. But with essential thrombocythemia, the defect happens after your leukocytes branch off. So you will not see acute leukemias occur with essential thrombocythemia. 1And there are small nuances sort of like that 1that we can talk about to describe the different types 1of myeloproliferative disorders 1and how you can differentiate 1when one occurs versus the other, 1which we'll talk about in the next couple of videos.",science_health-and-medicine_hematologic-system-diseases-2
" Solve for x, 5x - 3 is less than 12 ""and"" 4x plus 1 is greater than 25. So let's just solve for X in each of these constraints and keep in mind that any x has to satisfy both of them because it's an ""and"" over here so first we have this 5 x minus 3 is less than 12 so if we want to isolate the x we can get rid of this negative 3 here by adding 3 to both sides so let's add 3 to both sides of this inequality. The left-hand side, we're just left with a 5x, the minus 3 and the plus 3 cancel out. 5x is less than 12 plus 3 is 15. Now we can divide both sides by positive 5, that won't swap the inequality since 5 is positive. So we divide both sides by positive 5 and we are left with just from this constraint that x is less than 15 over 5, which is 3. So that constraint over here. But we have the second constraint as well. We have this one, we have 4x plus 1 is greater than 25. So very similarly we can subtract one from both sides to get rid of that one on the left-hand side. And we get 4x, the ones cancel out. is greater than 25 minus one is 24. Divide both sides by positive 4 Don't have to do anything to the inequality since it's a positive number. And we get x is greater than 24 over 4 is 6. And remember there was that ""and"" over here. We have this ""and"". So x has to be less than 3 ""and"" x has to be greater than 6. So already your brain might be realizing that this is a little bit strange. This first constraint says that x needs to be less than 3 so this is 3 on the number line. We're saying x has to be less than 3 so it has to be in this shaded area right over there. This second constraint says that x has to be greater than 6. So if this is 6 over here, it says that x has to greater than 6. It can't even include 6. And since we have this ""and"" here. The only x-es that are a solution for this compound inequality are the ones that satisfy both. The ones that are in the overlap of their solution set. But when you look at it right over here it's clear that there is no overlap. There is no x that is both greater than 6 ""and"" less than 3. So in this situation we have no solution.",math_algebra_solve-equations-inequalities
" -  Moussa and Fatu were each asked to factor the quadratic expression 16 x-squared minus 64. Their responses are shown below. So Moussa factored it this way. Fatu factored it this way. Which student wrote an expression that is equivalent to 16 x-squared minus 64? So I encourage you to pause the video and figure that out. Which student wrote an expression that is equivalent to our original one, 16 x-squared minus 64? Well let's work through it together, so let's see if first we can factor this out somehow to get what Moussa got and it looks like Moussa first factored out a 16 and then he was left with a difference of squares. So let's see if we can do that. So, we can write our original expression. 16 x-squared minus 64, we can write that as 16 times x-squared minus 16 times four. And when you write it like that, it's very clear that you can factor out a 16. So this is going to be equal to 16 times what you have left over is x-squared minus four and then x-squared minus four, that's a difference of squares right over there. So, that part we can factor as, so we have our original 16 and then... this part right over here, we can write as x plus two times x minus two. x plus two times x minus two. If what I just did in this last step, going from x-squared minus four to x plus two times x minus two doesn't make any sense, I encourage you to watch some of the introductory videos on factoring and difference of squares. But the basic idea, I have a form here of a-squared minus b-squared, so it's going to have the form of a plus b times a minus b and in this case it's x-squared minus two squared. So it's going to be x plus two times x minus two. So that's exactly what Moussa got. So this one, so Moussa, did get an expression that is equivalent to 16 x-squared minus 64. Now let's think about Fatu. So Fatu didn't factor out a 16 from the get-go. It looks like he just immediately recognized that our original expression is itself a difference of squares even if we don't factor out a 16, and so let's re-write it. So our original expression, we could write as, so instead of writing, well I'm just going to write it like this, this is our original expression. 16 x-squared minus 64. That's the same thing as, 16 x-squared is the same thing as four x, the whole thing squared and then minus eight squared. So when you write it like this, it's clear that this is a difference of squares, so this is going to be four x plus eight times four x minus eight. Four x plus eight times four x minus eight. Once again, if this last step that I did doesn't make a lot of sense I encourage you to watch the video on factoring difference of squares where we go a lot more into the intuition of it. But when you see it this way you realize that Fatu also got an expression that is equivalent to 16 x-squared minus 64, so they both did.",math_algebra-home_alg-polynomials
" - Welcome to the reproductive system. So, let's start by asking, ""What is the reproductive system?"" It's basically a system in our bodies that includes our sex organs and certain parts of our brain. You can see the sex organs here on the male, and here in two places on the female. So, this system within our bodies allows us to reproduce, it allows us to make babies. And to make babies what we're doing is combining genetic material from a biological mother's egg and a biological father's sperm to make our offspring. And we typically do this by sexual intercourse. So, let's first take a brief look at a couple of the most important sex organs that make males and females have in their reproductive systems. So, the males have the testes. And these are the most important structures. Sort of the structures that everything else is built around in a male. And that's because the testes produce his contribution to a baby. They make these small mobile cells that carry his genetic material into a female to fuse with her genetic material to cause a pregcy. And these small mobile cells are his sperm. Another important male organ is the penis. And the penis is used to deliver his sperm inside the female mate to increase the chance that it meets her egg. So, those are really the major male organs. Now on the female side, one of her major organs is the ovary and she has two just like how males have two testes. And in fact the ovaries and testes are homologous, they came from the same precursor in development. Now the ovaries are responsible for producing the female's genetic contribution to a baby, that is the egg. The ovaries, though, are a lot different to the testes, in that the testes are constantly producing lots and lots of sperm. To the tune of of millions per day. Where as the ovaries only release one egg per month. So, the next really important female organ is called the uterus. And the uterus is basically a really thick muscular organ that's capable of stretching out and it's actually where the baby's actually developing during pregcy until birth. The next really important female structures are the breasts. And the breasts are important because they produce milk during the pregcy and afterwords via a process called lactation. And lactation happens due to a series of hormones that generally get released around pregcy. So, this breast milk that gets produced can feed and nourish the growing baby and it actually plays a roll in creating a stronger immune system for the baby. So, we've seen some of the major structures of both male and female reproductive systems. But is that all the reproductive systems are? Actually, no. Besides producing the sperm and egg, the reproductive systems produce chemicals whose signals have a really strong influence over activities in our bodies. We call these chemicals, hormones and because they come from our reproductive systems we refer to them as our sex hormones. For example, the male's major sex hormone, testosterone, which is actually produced in the testes, is responsible for many masculine traits. Such as body hair, the deepening of your voice, muscle growth, and there's possibly even a link to levels of aggression in males. On the female side of things, the ovary is the primary producer of some major female hormones, like estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen and progesterone play a major roll in the timing of egg release from the ovaries. Estrogen is also responsible for the development of a lot of feminine traits. For example, breast development. So, there's the making of the sperm and the egg, there's the production of the major sex hormones. What else does the reproductive system do? Well it does one more really important thing. And that's coordinate the meeting of the sperm and the egg. And it does that by the males penis and the females vagina. These two organs are used to ensure that the sperm and the egg meet each other. So, the penis actually deposits sperm within the vagina, so that sperm has a better chance of reaching and fertilizing the egg released inside her reproductive tract. So, you might be thinking, ""Does the reproductive system ""do all this stuff on it's own?"" I mean what tells it what to do? And that's a good question. The reproductive system is actually controlled by the brain. There's an area in the brain called the hypothalamus that sits just about there on the inside of the brain, just about in the middle. And the hypothalamus actually releases a hormone called gonadotropin releasing hormone or GNRH. GNRH effects another part of the brain called, anteriorpituitary which sits right about there just under the hypothalamus. And anteriorpituitary in response to GNRH releases two hormones lutenizing hormone or LH and follicle stimulating hormone or FSH. And its the lutenizing hormone and the follicle stimulating hormone that primarily effect the male and female sex organs. So, the male's testes and the female's ovaries to control their functions. Finally, a word on pregcy, as pregcy is a huge part of reproduction and certainly the most long lasting part. So, pregcy results when a sperm successfully fertilizes an egg to create a zygote. A zygote is a first cell in a new organism that has genetic material from both mom and dad. And that genetic material has come from the sperm and the egg that have fused. The zygote goes through a series of developments and eventually implants itself within the inner wall of a woman's uterus to grow. So, that's in here, remember that thick muscular organ we talked about? The third step is what we'll really broadly call gestation. Gestation is basically the development of the fetus into a baby. So, the development of all the fetus's organ systems including their brains, spinal cord, lungs, cardiovascular system, their reproductive system, all the systems in their body. Gestation readies the developing infant to be born. And it takes about nine months. When the babies ready to come out of the uterus and into the world a number of hormonal changes take place in the mother's body. This signals her to start getting ready to push the baby out of her body, in other words, give birth to the baby. She then goes through a process called labor, also known as parturition, to give birth to the baby. After the baby's born, the last step is to give him or her a name.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" Welcome back. In the last video, I told you that pressure times volume is a constant. That if you increase the pressure-- or if you increase the volume, you're going to decrease the pressure. Hopefully, you got an intuitive sense why. Or likewise, if you squeezed the balloon, or the box, and there are no openings there, then the pressure within the box would increase. With that said, let's see if we can do a couple of fairly typical problems that you'll see. So let's say that I have a box, or a balloon, or something, and it has a volume, and so let me call this the initial volume. My initial volume is 50 cubic meters, and my initial pressure is 500 pascals. Just so you remember, what's a pascal? That's 500 newtons per meter cubed. I take that box, or balloon, or whatever, and I compress it down to 20 meters cubed. So I compress it, so I squeeze it-- that was the first example that I gave last time. It was the same container, and I squeeze it down to 20 meters cubed. What's going to be the new pressure? You should immediately have an intuition-- what happens when you squeeze a balloon? It becomes harder to do it. What's going to be the new pressure? It's definitely going to be higher-- when you decrease the volume, the pressure increases are inversely related. The pressure's going to go up, and let's see if we can calculate it. We know that P1 times v1 is equal to some constant, and since we have no aggregate change in energy-- I'm just telling you that the box is squeezed, I'm not telling you whether it did any work, or anything like that-- the same constant is going to be equal to the new pressure times the new volume, which is equal to P2 times V2. You could just have the general relationship: P1 times V1 is equal to P2 times V2, assuming that no work was done, and there was no exchange of energy from outside of the system. In most of these cases, when you see this on an exam, that is the case. The old pressure was 500 pascals times 50 meters cubed. One thing to keep in mind, because this equivalence is not equal, and we're not saying it has to equal some necessary absolute number-- for example, we don't know exactly what this K is, although we could figure it out right now-- as long as you're using one unit for pressure on this side, and one unit for volume on this side, you just have to use the same units. We could have done this same exact problem the exact same way, if instead of meters cubed, they said liters, as long as we had liters here. You just have to make sure you're using the same units on both sides. In this case, we have 500 pascals as the pressure, and the volume is 50 meters cubed. That's going to be equal to the new pressure, P2, times the new volume, 20 meters cubed. Let's see what we can do: we can divide both sides by 10, so we can take the 10 out of there, and we could divide both sides by 2, so that becomes a 250. We we get 250 times 5 is equal to P2, and so P2 is equal to 1250 pascals, and if we kept with the units, you would have seen that. When I decreased the volume by roughly 60%, I have the pressure actually increased by 2 1/2, so that gels with what we talked about before. Let's add another variable into this mix-- let's talk about temperature. Like pressure, volume, work, and a lot of concepts that we talk about in physics, temperature is something that you probably are at least reasonably familiar with. How do you view temperature? A high temperature means something is hot, and a low temperature means something is cold, and I think that also gives you intuition that a higher temperature object has more energy. The sun has more energy than an ice cube-- I think that's fair enough. I think you also have the sense that-- what would have more energy? A 100 degree cup of tea, or a 100 degree barrel of tea. I want to make them equivalent in terms of what they're holding. I think you have a sense. Even though they're the same temperature, they're both pretty warm-- let's say this is 100 degrees Celsius, so they're both boiling-- that the barrel, because there's more of it, is going to have more energy. It's equally hot, and there's just more molecules there. That's what temperature is. Temperature, in general, is a measure roughly equal to some constant times the kinetic energy-- the average kinetic energy-- per molecule. So the average kinetic energy of the system divided by the total number of molecules we have. Another way we could talk about is, temperature is essentially energy per molecule. So something that has a lot of molecules, where N is the number of molecules. Another way we could view this is that the kinetic energy of the system is going to be equal to the number of molecules times the temperature. This is just a constant-- times 1 over K, but we don't even know what this is, so we could say that's still a constant-- so the kinetic energy of the system is going to be equal to some constant times the number of particles times temperature. We don't know what this is, and we're going to figure this out later. This is another interesting concept. We said that pressure times volume is proportional to the kinetic energy of the system-- the aggregate, if you take all of the molecules and combine their kinetic energies. These aren't the same K's-- I could put another constant here and call that K1. And we also know that the kinetic energy of the system is equal to some other constant times the number of molecules I have times the temperature. If you think about it, you could also say that this is proportional to this, and this is proportional to this. You could say that pressure times volume is proportional to the number-- and these are all different proportional constants, and we'll figure out this exact constant later-- so we could say that pressure times volume is proportional to molecules we have, times temperature. And we said that we can view temperature as energy per molecule. Another way we could say is that if this constant is constant, which is by definition, and the number of molecules is constant-- we have PV over temperature. Pressure times volume over temperature is going to be equal to something times the number of molecules, so we could say that's some other constant, like k4. This is another interesting thing to think about: we said pressure times volume is equal to pressure times volume, and now we added temperature into the mix. We could say P1 times V1 over T1 is equal to P2 times V2 over T2. Does this make sense to you? What happens if I have another box, and I have my particles bouncing around like always. I have some volume, and some amount of pressure-- what happens when the temperature goes up? What am I saying? I'm saying that the average kinetic energy per molecule is going to go up, so they're going to bounce against the walls more. If they bounce against the walls more, the pressure's going to go up, assuming volume stays flat. Another way you could think about it-- let's say the temperature goes up, and the pressure stays flat. So what did I have to do? I just said if the temperature goes up, the average kinetic energy of each molecule-- they'll bounce more. In order to make them bounce against the sides of the walls 1as often, I'd have to increase the volume. 1If you hold pressure constant, the only way you can do that 1is by increasing the volume while you increase the 1temperature. 1Let's keep this in mind, and we will use this to solve some 1pretty typical problems in the next video.",science_physics_thermodynamics
" In all of the double integrals we've done so far, the boundaries on x and y were fixed. Now we'll see what happens when the boundaries on x and y are variables. So let's say I have the same surface, and I'm not going to draw it the way it looks, I'll just kind of draw it figuratively. But the problem we're actually going to do is z, and this is the exact same one we've been doing all along. The point of here isn't to show you how to integrate, the point of here is to show you how to visualize and think about these problems. And frankly, in double integral problems the hardest part is figuring out the boundaries. Once you do that, the integration is pretty straightforward. It's really not any harder then single variable integration. So let's say that's our surface: z is equal to xy squared. Let me draw the axes again. So that's my x-axis. That's my z-axis. That's my y-axis. x, y, and z. And you saw what this graph looked like several videos ago. I took out the whole grapher and we rotated and things. I'm not going to draw the graph the way it looks; I'm just going to brought fairly abstractly as just an abstract surface. Because the point here it's really to figure out the boundaries of integration. Before I actually even draw the surface, I'm going to draw the boundary. The first time we did this problem we said, OK, x goes from 0 to 2, y goes from 0 to 1, and then we figured out the volume above that bounded domain. Now let's do something else. Let's say that x goes from 0 to 1. And let's say that the volume that we want to figure out under the surface, it's not from a fixed y to an upper-bound y. I'll show you: it's actually a curve. So this is all on the xy plane, everything I'm drawing here. And this curve, we could view it two ways: we could say y is a function of x, y is equal to x squared. Or we could write is equal to square root of y. We don't have to write plus or minus or anything like that because we're in the first quadrant. So this is the area above which we want to figure out the volume. Let me, yeah, it doesn't hurt to color it in just so we can really hone in on what we care about. So that's the area above which we want to figure out the volume. You could kind of say, that's our bounded domain. And so x goes from 0 to 1, and then this point is going to be what? That point's going to be 1 comma 1, right? 1 is equal to 1 squared, 1 is equal to the square root of 1. So this point is y is equal to 1. And then I'm not going to draw this surface exactly. I'm just trying to give you a sense of what the volume of the figure we're trying to calculate is. If this is just some arbitrary surface-- let me do it in a different color --so this is the top. This line is going vertical in the z-direction. Actually, I could draw it like this, like it's a curve. And then this curve back here is going to be like a wall. And maybe I'll paint this side of the wall just so you can see what it kind of looks like. Trying my best. Think you get an idea. Let me make it a little darker; this is actually more of an exercise in art than in math, in many ways. You get the idea. And then the boundary here is like this. And this top isn't flat, you know, it could be curved surface. I do a little like that, but it's a curved surface. And we know in the example we're about to do that the surface right here is z is equal to x squared. So we want to figure out the volume under this. So how do we do it? Well, let's think about it. We could actually use the intuition that I just gave you. We're essentially just going to take a da, which is a little small square down here, and that little area, that's the same thing as the dx-- let me use a darker color --as a dx times a dy, and then we just have to multiply it times f of xy, which is this, for each area, and then some them all up. And then we could take a sum in the x-direction first or the y-direction first. Now before doing that, just to make sure that you have the intuition because the boundaries are the hard part, let me just draw our xy plane. So let me rotate it up like that. I'm just going to draw our xy plane. Because that's what matters. Because the hard part here is just figuring out our bounds of integration. So the curve is just y is equal to x squared, look something like that. This is the point y is equal to 1. This is y-axis, this is the x-axis, this is the point x is equal to 1. That's not an x, that's a 1. This is the x. Anyway, so we want to figure out, how do we sum up this dx times dy, or this da, along this domain? So let's draw it. Let's visually draw it and it doesn't hurt to do this when you actually have to do the problem because this frankly is the hard part. A lot of calculus teachers will just have you set up the integral and then say, OK, well the rest is easy. Or the rest is Calc 1. OK, so this area, this area here is the same thing as this area here. So its base is dx and its height is dy. And then you could imagine that we're looking at this thing from above. So the surface is up here some place and we're looking straight down on it, and so this is just this area. So let's say we wanted to take the integral with respect to x first. So we want to sum up, so if we want the volume above this column, first of all, is this area times dx, dy, right? So let's write the volume above that column. It's going to be the value of the function, the height at that point, which is xy squared times dx, dy. This expression gives us the volume above this area, or this column right here. And let's say we want the sum in the x direction first. So we want to sum that dx, sum one here, sum here, et cetera, et cetera. So we're going to sum in the x-direction. So my question to you is, what is our lower bound of integration? Well, we're kind of holding our y constant, right? And so if we go to the left, if we go lower and lower x's we kind of bump into the curve here. So the lower bound of integration is actually the curve. And what is this curve if we were to write x is a function of y? This curve is y is equal to x squared, or x is equal to the square root of y. So if we're integrating with respect to x for a fixed y right here-- we're integrating in the horizontal direction first --our lower bound is x is equal to the square root of y. That's interesting. I think it's the first time you've probably seen a variable bound integral. But it makes sense because for this row that we're adding up right here, the upper bound is easy. The upper bound is x is equal to 1. The upper bound is x is equal to 1, but the lower bound is x is equal to the square root of y. Because you go back like, oh, I bump into the curve. And what's the curve? Well the curve is x is equal to the square root of y because we don't know which y we picked. Fair enough. So once we've figured out the volume-- so that'll give us the volume above this rectangle right here --and then we want to add up the dy's. And remember, there's a whole volume above what I'm drawing right here. I'm just drawing this part in the xy plane. So what we've done just now, this expression, as it's written right now, figures out the volume above that rectangle. Now if we want to figure out the entire volume of the solid, we integrate along the y-axis. Or we add up all the dy's. This was a dy right here, not a dx. My dx's and dy's look too similar. So now what is the lower bound on the y-axis if I'm summing up these rectangles? Well, the lower bound is y is equal to 0. So we're going to go from y is equal to 0 to what-- what is the upper bound? --to y is equal to 1. And there you have it. Let me rewrite that integral. So the double integral is going to be from x is equal to square root of y to x is equal to 1, xy squared, dx, dy. And then the y bound, y goes from 0 to y to 1. I've just realized I've run out of time. In the next video we'll evaluate this, and then we'll do it in the other order. See you soon.",math_multivariable-calculus_integrating-multivariable-functions
" -  Phobia is this extreme and unreasonable or irrational fear of something. That something can be anything from an animal to an iimate object, to situations or activities. Having a phobia isn't just your everyday worries, stress, or fears though. It's not just being scared of a dark alley or being worried about flying on a plane. People with specific phobias work super hard to avoid whatever object they're afraid of even is they know there's actually no real danger or threat. And they might feel powerless to stop this fear and feel extreme anxiety even thinking about the object. Because of this, phobias can seriously disrupt daily routines, limit your work efficiency, reduce your self-esteem, and strain relationships because someone might do whatever they can to avoid feeling the anxious and sometimes terrifying feelings of a phobia. As an example, many people might feel little uneasier or annoyed camping at night when tons of moths start to swarm around your lanterns. But, knowing this will probably happen likely won't affect your decision to go camping, right? Someone with mottephobia or fear of moths might actually avoid the camping trip altogether because they know that there's this chance of seeing a moth. This avoidance might interfere with your social life and your relationship with your friends. Obviously, a fear of moths isn't the only phobia, though. It's not even in the top 10. Anyway, some of the more common phobias are things like fear of blood, or hemophobia, as well as fears of medical procedures, especially things like injections and needles. There can also be fears of animals, though, especially snakes or ophidiophobia, dogs or cynophobia, and spiders or arachnophobia. An example situation could be like claustrophobia, which is a fear of constricted or enclosed, or tight spaces. Someone with claustrophobia might have this intense fear of getting on an elevator because it's so compact. As somewhat of an opposite example, agoraphobia is a fear of going out into an open or crowded space which can be anything from malls to markets, to theaters. Oftentimes they're fearful of not being able to escape. Someone might also have a fear of heights or falling which is acrophobia, or a fear of flying, aerophobia. And finally, you could be afraid of some natural phenomenon, too, like lightning, which is called astraphobia. Now being exposed to the feared object or even thinking about being exposed to the feared object might cause severe symptoms of anxiety that are much stronger than the real threat. People with phobias often catastrophize, or immediately jump to the worst case scenario and also overestimate the chances of that actually happening. This might lead to physical symptoms like sweating, muscle control issues, or fast heart rates. Even though certain things like spiders can cause anxiety with a lot of people, it's super important to emphasize the difference between an everyday anxiety about something and a specific phobia. As an example, an everyday anxiety might be feeling queezy when you enter the spider exhibit at the zoo. Someone with arachnophobia or fear of spiders might avoid going to the zoo altogether to avoid seeing any spiders. Another everyday anxiety might be feeling dizzy when climbing a ladder. Someone with a fear of heights might not go to their best friend's wedding just because it's on the 30th floor of a hotel. Finally, an everyday anxiety might be being scared on a plane during severe turbulence where someone with aerophobia might avoid getting on a plane altogether, even if it was to go accept a promotion to their job. If someone does actually have a phobia and it's not just everyday fear, what causes it? Where does this come from? Well, the answer to that is not really known. One thing that is known is you're more likely to have a phobia if you have a family member with a phobia. Another way someone might develop a phobia, though, is from specific bad experiences. For example, someone that suffered a severe bite by a rabid dog might develop cynophobia or fear of dogs. Or even seeing someone else being very afraid of something could trigger a specific phobia. Those that have a phobia will likely be diagnosed by a healthcare professional that asks specific questions about your symptoms as well having your physical exam taken and asking about particular medications which can all help rule out other medical conditions that might be producing the anxiety. Once the phobia is diagnosed, though, treatment can be administered. Here it's important to tailor the treatment to the specific patients since patients respond differently to therapy, especially if other conditions are involved like depression or drug abuse. Cognitive behavior therapy is specific kind of psychotherapy is particularly effective for specific phobias. First, therapists will likely try to help the patient identify a mistake in beliefs and realize they're probably overestimating their fear and talk about the realistic risks. For example, being bitten by a rabid dog is actually a pretty rare occurrence. Secondly, they'll expose the person to the feared situation. Using the same example, the therapist might have the patient get closer to a dog which helps them learn to take acceptable risks that are relatively safe. Although the treatment regimen varies with each patient and the time required for treatment also varies, the vast majority of people with specific phobias can be helped with professional care.",science_health-and-medicine_mental-health
" Let's do a few more examples where we're evaluating expressions with unknown variables. So this first one we're told 3x plus 3y plus 3z is equal to 1, and then we're asked what's 12x plus 12y plus 12z equal to? And I'll give you a few moments to think about that. Well let's rewrite this second expression by factoring out the 12, so we get 12 times x plus y plus z. That's this second expression here, and you can verify that by distributing the 12. You'll get exactly this right up here. Now, what is 12 times x plus y plus z? Well, we don't know yet exactly what x plus y plus z is equal to, but this first equation might help us. This first equation, we can rewrite this left-hand side by factoring out the 3, so we could rewrite this as 3 times x plus y plus z is equal to 1. All I did is I factored the 3 out on the left-hand side. And then if I want to solve for x plus y plus z, I just divide both sides of this equation by 3, and I'm left with x plus y plus z is equal to 1/3, and so here, instead of x plus y plus z, I can write 1/3. So this whole thing simplified to 12 times 1/3. 12 times 1/3 is the same thing as 12 divided by 3, which is equal to 4. Let's try one more. So here we are told that 3a plus 5b is equal to 2, and then we're asked what's 15a plus 15b going to be equal to? So we might-- let's see. I'll give you a few moments to try to tackle this on your own. Let's see how we might do it. We could approach it the way we've approached the last few problems, trying to rewrite the second expression. We could rewrite it as 15 times a plus b, and so we just have to figure out what a plus b is, and we'll be able to evaluate this expression. And so, it's tempting to look up here, and say maybe we can solve for a plus b somehow, but we really can't. If we divide-- if we try to factor out a 3, we'll get 3 times a plus 5/3b, so this doesn't really simplify things in terms of a plus b. If we try to factor out a 5, we'd get 5 times 3/5a plus b is equal to 2, but neither of these gets us in a form where we can then solve for a plus b. So in this situation, we actually do not have enough information to solve this problem. So it's a little bit of a trick. Not enough info to solve. Anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that.",math_algebra-home_alg-polynomials
" - So Asperger Syndrome or Asperger's is one of the Autism Spectrum Disorders. And while everyone with Asperger's is affected a little differently most people with this syndrome have some difficulties relating to other people. And this stems from having trouble with social communication and interactions. So let's draw a few pictures here to better understand what we mean by trouble with communication and interactions. So, I'm just going to draw this face here and let's make this face happy. And now imagine if you were having a conversation with this person here and all of a sudden their smile here it turned upside down into a frown. Well, that might indicate to you that something about this conversation, maybe something you said, or something you did, or maybe something that the person was thinking about, something upset or bothered this person here, right, to make them frown. Well, if a person with Asperger's was having a conversation with someone and their facial expression changed, like it did here, the person with Asperger's actually might not really notice this. And that's because people with Asperger's have trouble using and understanding these sorts of non verbal behaviours like facial expressions or gestures. And they might continue on with the conversation as though nothing had changed because this doesn't really indicate to them that the person is unhappy. And if we draw a person here and maybe let's say that this person is walking by and they say, ""Good morning"" and they wave, and smile. Well, for someone with Asperger's they might not really realize that they're supposed to return or reciprocate this gesture by also saying, ""Good morning,"" and waving back. It might not really occur to them that this is something that they're supposed to do. For someone with Asperger's it doesn't really seem like a required response. And we actually describe this as trouble with social and emotional reciprocity. And Reciprocity here just means kind of returning or exchanging something. So in this case, it means returning the friendly greeting. So this social and emotional reciprocity is kind of like the give and take of a conversation. It's what allows us to converse and interact with other people. And this is something that people with Asperger's have a lot of trouble with. And let's draw one final picture here, so let's say that it just rained and now there's this really pretty rainbow in the sky. Well, if you saw that you might have a desire to point it out and share this pretty rainbow with someone around you. But for someone with Asperger's they don't really have this spontaneous desire to share something of interest or enjoyment with someone else. So they don't really point things out that interest them, or excite them, or share their achievements with other people. So this trouble with communication and interaction is one of the main features of Asperger's. And these different examples here are some ways that this trouble with communication and interaction can manifest in someone with Asperger's. And there's one other main feature of Asperger's and that's Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behaviours. So in order for us to see what we mean by Restricted Interests let's actually draw a graph here. A graph that shows the level of interest in a few different activities. And you'll see what I mean in a sec. So on our y-axis here, let's make this the Level of Interest so the higher up we are here, the more interest there is. And on our x-axis here we'll put down some different activities. And we'll use this pink color here to show what we might Expect from the average child. And we'll use this green color here to show what we might see from a child with Asperger's. Okay, so let's put down a few activities here. So let's put down Reading and we'll put down Drawing. And let's do one more, we'll put down Playing with Blocks. So these are a few of the activities that we're going to look at. So maybe we would expect that quite a few kids like to Read so let's maybe draw our Reading bar to about here. So this about the Level of Interest that we might expect from the average kid. And maybe we would expect even more kids like to Draw than they do Read so maybe we'll make this bar a little higher here. And let's say that we expect kids to like Playing with Blocks about the same as we would expect them to like Drawing. So maybe we'll make that one about the same height here. Now for kids with Asperger's they usually have an activity or two that they're really, really keen on, they're super into it. But then they don't really show interest in other activities. So for example, maybe for someone with Asperger's they really aren't really interested or keen on Reading. So their little bar would be way down here, a lot lower than what we might expect from the average child. And they don't really want to Draw at all so their bar is also really low. But let's say they absolutely love Playing with Blocks. They would spend all their time Playing with Blocks if they could, they're really keen on blocks. And they're way more keen then we would expect from an average kid so their interest level is way up here. So while every kid with Asperger's is different and has different levels of interest in different activities generally what we see is something like this. This restricted interest in one or two activities and then not much interest at all in anything else. So this kind of shows us what we mean by Restricted activities. And when we say Repetitive Behaviours here what we mean are things like lining up toys or moving certain body parts in repetitive ways. So this is something that we also often see in someone with Asperger's. So it turns out that these main signs of Asperger's are actually what we use to diagnose the syndrome. There really isn't a blood test or a brain scan that we can use to confirm Asperger's so we really rely on looking for these behavioral signs. And how we usually go about doing that is by asking the parent questions and watching the kid who we think has Asperger's interact with other people. So maybe we watch to see if they're making eye contact or using non verbal cues. We'd look to see if they're picking up on the body language changes or changes in tone of voice from other people when they're talking to them. We might play with them and see if they want to show us their toys that they like or share something with us. We might ask them or their parents about their interests to see if they seem kind of restrictive like this graph here. These sorts of questions and observations would help us look for these signs of Asperger's. Now at this point you might be wondering what's the difference between Asperger's and Autistic Disorder? Because if you've read or heard anything about Autistic Disorder it sounds pretty similar to what we're describing here. So while the two are very similar there's one kind of main thing that sets Asperger's apart from Autistic Disorder. So kids with Asperger's they don't really appear to have any delays in language or intellectual development. They don't really miss any of those key language milestones like their first word. Whereas for kids with Autistic Disorder this is something that is often noticed by the parents pretty early on. The parents notice that their kid is kind of missing language milestones or just doesn't quite seem to be developing the way they should be. So that's one of the big differences between Asperger's and Autistic Disorder. And you can imagine that if there aren't really any apparent delays in language with kids with Asperger's it could mean that it would take quite a while to figure out that a kid has Asperger's and to make the diagnosis. And this is, indeed, the case. So for a lot of kids with Asperger's it isn't really picked up on until later on when they're put into a demanding social situation like a new school environment. Now while we're on the topic of diagnosing Asperger's I should actually point out that a few years ago one of the main manuals, the main guides that we use to make diagnoses which is called the ""Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders"" or the ""DSM"", well, the ""DSM"" actually changed a bit. And it removed Asperger's as its own diagnosis. So in the previous version of the ""DSM"" the ""DSM 4"" and just so you know we're currently on the ""DSM 5"" so in the older version the ""DSM 4"" someone could be diagnosed with one of a few different Autism Spectrum Disorders. So there was Asperger's, Autistic Disorder, Childhood disintegrative disorder, and Pervasive developmental disorder. So these were all individual disorders that someone can be diagnosed with. But when the new ""DSM 5"" came out it was decided that it would be better to kind of merge these all together, these different disorders into one disorder, Autism Spectrum Disorder. The idea was that this one Spectrum here would better account for all the different variations that we see in people with Autistic Disorders by putting everyone on one Spectrum rather than having several distinct disorders with different criteria. So that's what the ""DSM 5"" looks like. So now in the ""DSM 5"" instead of having Asperger's as a diagnosis that can be made there's just one Autism Spectrum Disorder. But not every country uses the ""DSM"" so depending on what guidelines are used in your country to make a diagnosis, you might still see a diagnoses of Asperger Syndrome made. So whether someone is diagnosed with Asperger's or Autism Spectrum Disorder instead the Management is very similar. There isn't any medication or specific plan to manage Asperger's. And because everyone is very different Management plans can vary a lot between different people with the syndrome. So the main sort of goal of Management is to get the parents, and other family members, and teachers to create an environment that allows the kid with Asperger's to work on improving their communication and interaction skills. So to help the kid work on their social skills parents might encourage making eye contact and understanding and using body language during conversations. They might help the kid understand social conventions like sharing, and smiling, and greeting people, and really emphasizing these on a daily basis. And in order to encourage new interests because remember, kids with Asperger's can be really Restrictive with their interests. 1Parents and teachers might try to find activities 1that are similar to but still different 1from the one that the kid with Asperger's enjoys. 1So maybe if the kid really enjoys drawing, for example, 1parents and teachers might try to encourage 1other similar artistic activities 1like painting or sculpting.",science_health-and-medicine_mental-health
" -  So, I'm defining the random variable x as the number of workouts that I will do in a given week. Now right over here, this table describes the probability distribution for x. And as you can see, x can take on only a finite number of values, zero, one, two, three, or four. And so, because there's a finite number of values here, we would call this a discrete random variable. And you can see that this is a valid probability distribution because the combined probability is one. .1 plus 0.15, plus 0.4, plus 0.25, plus 0.1 is one. And none of these are negative probabilities, which wouldn't have made sense. But what we care about in this video is the notion of an expected value of a discrete random variable, which we would just note this way. And one way to think about it is, once we calculate the expected value of this variable, of this random variable, that in a given week, that would give you a sense of the expected number of workouts. This is also sometimes referred to as the mean of a random variable. This, right over here, is the Greek letter mu, which is often used to denote the mean. So, this is the mean of the random variable x. But how do we actually compute it? To compute this, we essentially just take the weighted sum of the various outcomes, and we weight them by the probabilities. So, for example, this is going to be, the first outcome here is zero, and we'll weight it by its probability of 0.1. So, it's zero times 0.1. Plus, the next outcome is one, and it'd be weighted by its probability of 0.15. So, plus one times 0.15. Plus, the next outcome is two and has a probability of 0.4, plus two times 0.4. Plus, the outcome three has a probability of 0.25, plus three times 0.25. And then last but not least, we have the outcome four workouts in a week, that has a probability of 0.1, plus four times 0.1. Well, we can simplify this a little bit. Zero times anything is just zero. So, one times 0.15 is 0.15. Two times 0.4 is 0.8. Three times 0.25 is 0.75. And then four times .1 is 0.4. And so, we just have to add up these numbers. So, we get 0.15, plus .8, plus .75, plus .4, and let's say 0.4, 0.75, 0.8. Let's add 'em all together. And so, let's see, five plus five is 10. And then this is two plus eight is 10, plus seven is 17, plus four is 21. So, we get all of this is going to be equal to 2.1. So, one way to think about it is the expected value of x, the expected number of workouts for me in a week, given this probability distribution, is 2.1. Now you might be saying, wait, hold on a second. All of the outcomes here are whole numbers. How can you have 2.1 workouts in a week? What is .1 of a workout? Well, this isn't saying that in a given week, you would expect me to work out exactly 2.1 times. But this is valuable because you could say, well, in 10 weeks, you would expect me to do roughly 21 workouts. Sometimes I might do zero workouts, sometimes one, sometimes two, sometimes three, sometimes four. But in 100 weeks, you might expect me to do 210 workouts. So, even for a random variable that can only take on integer values, you can still have a non-integer expected value, and it is still useful.",math_ap-statistics_random-variables-ap
" -  Duncan is investigating if residence of a city support the construction of a new high school. He's curious about the difference of opinion between residence in the north and south parts of the city. He obtained separate random samples of voters from each region, here are the results. So let's see, in the north 54 out of the 120 said they want the school, 66 said they didn't. In the south 77 said they wanted the school, 63 said they didn't. Duncan wants to use these results to construct a 90% confidence interval to estimate the difference in the proportion of residence in these regions who support the construction project. P sub S minus P sub N. So these are the true parameters for the difference between these two populations. Assume that all of the conditions for inference have been met. Alright, which of the following is a correct 90% confidence interval based on Duncan's sample? So pause this video and see if you can figure that out and you will need a calculator and depending on your calculator you might need a Z table as well. In a previous video we introduced the idea of a two sample Z interval and we talked about the conditions for inference. Lucky for us here they say the conditions for inference have been met. So we can go straight to calculating the confidence interval. And that confidence interval is going to be the difference between the sample proportions, so P sub S hat, so the sample proportion in the south minus the sample proportion in the north, it's gonna be that difference plus or minus our critical value, Z star, times our estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the difference between the sample proportions. And that is going to be our estimate is going to be P hat sub S times one minus P hat sub S, all of that over the sample size in the south plus P hat sub N times one minus P hat sub N, all of that over the sample size in the north. Okay, so our sample proportion in the south, I'll later use a calculator to get a decimal value, but this is going to be in the south we have 77 out of 140 support it. So this is going to be 77 out of 140. In the north this is going to be 54 out of 120, 54 out of 120. What is my critical Z value? Well here I'm gonna have to either use a calculator or a Z table. Remember, we have a 90% confidence interval. And so, let me see, I'll draw it right over here. If this is a normal distribution and you wanna have a 90% confidence interval that means you're containing 90% of the distribution which means each of these tails well combined they would have 10%, but each of them would have 5% of the distribution. And so I'm gonna look at a Z table that figures out how many standard deviations below the mean do I need to be in order to get 5% right over here? And then that's going to tell me, well if I'm that far below or above that's gonna be my critical Z value. So let me get that Z table out. So I care about 5% and I'm using this in a bit of a reverse direction, but let's see, 5%. So this a little over 5%, I'm getting closer to 5%, even closer to 5%, now we've gotten right below 5%. So we're gonna be in between this and this. I could just split the difference and I could just say, 1.6, let's just say 1.645 to go right in between. So this is going to be approximately equal to 1.645. And then let's see, we know what P hat sub S is, we know what P hat sub N is. In the south our sample size is 140 and in the north our sample size is 120. And so now I just have to type all of this into the calculator, which is gonna get a little hairy, but we will do it together. For the sake of time we'll accelerate this typing into the calculator. But I'm gonna start with calculating the upper bound and then we'll calculate the lower bound. And then I think I've closed all my parentheses and so I think we're ready to get the upper bound is going to be equal to 0.218 or approximately 0.202. So we can immediately look at our choices and see where is at the upper bound. And so this one is looking pretty good, 0.202, but let's get the lower bound now. So I got my calculator back, instead of retyping everything I'm just gonna put a minus here. So I go to second, and just so you see what I'm doing, second entry, I see the entry back and then I can just change, I can just change the part where right before the radical. So we are going to, alright, so this just needs to be a minus, click enter, and there you have it. Our lower bound is negative 0.002. And that is indeed this choice right over here. So there we go, we have picked our choice.",math_ap-statistics_two-sample-inference
" Mr. Theisen is honing his deadly three-point precision on the basketball court. For one of his shots, the height of the ball in feet as a function of horizontal distance, in feet, y of x-- so here y is a function of x. So the height must be y because that's the thing that is a function of something else. So this right over here is height. So our y-axis is going to represent height. And it is a function of x. So x must represent horizontal distance because height is a function of horizontal distance. So this right over here is horizontal distance. Now, it's plotted below. Mr Theisen is standing at x equals 0. So he's standing right over here. This is Mr. Theisen, as I draw my best attempt to draw a little stick figure version of Mr. Theisen. That's not even an acceptable stick figure right over there. So this is Mr. Theisen, and he's standing at x equals 0. And at x equals 0, he is shooting a basketball. And you see from the function right over here that where the graph intersects the y-axis, that tells us that's essentially the height of the ball when x is equal 0, where it's where Mr. Theisen is standing. And if we look at this, this looks like it's 2, 4, 6 feet high. So that's really the initial position of the ball when Mr. Theisen is about to let go of it. Then he lets go of it, and the ball goes in this parabolic trajectory. It increases, increases, increasing, increases. It looks like it hits a maximum point right around there, roughly. That looks like it's at about 16 feet. And then it starts to go down. And right over here-- and this looks like it's about, let's see, 22, 24, 26 feet out-- it looks like it hit something. And considering that something is 10 feet high, it's reasonable to assume that the thing that it hits is the goal. And especially because the question states that he has deadly three-point precision, we can assume it's not crazy that he actually makes the goal. And so that's where it goes into the net. And then the net forces the ball to go down at a much steeper trajectory. And this is exactly, of course, 10 feet high, the height of the goal. Now let's see which of these interpretations are consistent with the interpretation that we just did. The ball is released from Mr. Theisen's hand at a height of 6 feet. Well, that looks exactly right. When x is equal to 0, the ball is 6 feet. And not only is that right, but that is the significance of the y-intercept of this function. The y-intercept is the value of y, the height when x is equal to 0. So that is indeed the significance of the y-intercept. Let's look at these other things. Mr. Theisen is shooting the basketball from 26 feet away. Well, that's right. He's at x equals 0. The goal is at 26 feet away. But that's not the significance of the y-intercept. That would be the significance of where we saw this little point here where the ball dropped down at a steeper angle. The rim of the basketball hoop is 10 feet high. Once again, that's true. You can look at it. You can see it right over there. But that's not the significance of the y-intercept. The maximum height that the ball reaches is 16 feet. Well, once again, that is true, but that's the significance of this maximum point on the curve. That's not the significance of the y-intercept. So we'll go with this first choice.",math_math1_functions
"  In the last video, I touched on the idea of a sigma bond. And that was a bond-- well, let me draw two nucleuses and let me just draw one of the orbitals. Let's say this is an sp3 hybridized orbital, and that's on this atom and this is kind of this big lobe right there. And then this guy has an sp3 hybridized orbital as well. That's the small lobe, and then that's the big lobe like that. A sigma bond is one where there's an overlap kind of in the direction in which the lobes are pointed. And you might say, well, how can there be any other type of bond than that? Well, the other type of bond, so this right here-- let me make this clear. This right here is a sigma bond. And you say, well, what other kind of bond could there be where my two orbitals overlap kind of in the direction that they're pointing? And the other type of bond you could have, you can imagine if you have two p orbitals. So let me draw the nucleus of two atoms, and I'll just draw one of each of their p orbitals. So let's say that that's the nucleus and I'll just draw their p orbitals. So a p orbital is just that dumbbell shape. Let me draw them a little bit closer together. So a p orbital is that dumbbell shape. So let me draw this guy's-- one of his p orbitals. I want to draw it a little bit bigger than that, and you'll see why a second. So one of his p orbitals right there. It comes out like that. And then this guy over here also has a p orbital that is parallel to this p orbital, so it goes like that.  Let me draw that other one a little bit straighter. It goes-- I want it to overlap more, so it goes like that. I think you get the idea. So here, our two p orbitals are parallel to each other. This, you can imagine, these are sp3 hybridized orbitals. They're pointing at each other. Here, they're parallel. p orbitals are parallel to each other, and you see that they overlap on this kind of top lobe here and in this bottom lobe here. And this is a pi bond. Let me make this clear. And this is one pi bond. So you could call it a pi, literally, with the Greek letter pi: pi bond. Sometimes you'll see this just written as pi bond. And it's called a pi bond because it's the Greek letter for essentially p, and we're dealing with p orbitals overlapping. Now sigma bonds, which are what form when you have a single bond, these are stronger than pi bonds; pi bonds come into play once you start forming double or triple bonds on top of a sigma bond. To kind of get a better visualization of how that might work, let's think about ethene. So it's molecular structure looks like this. So you have C double-bonded to C, and then each of those guys have two hydrogens.  So let me draw what it would look like, or our best visual, or our best ability to kind of conceptualize what the orbitals around the carbon might look like.  So first I'll draw the sp2 hybridized orbitals. So let me just make it very clear what's going on here. So when we were dealing with methane, which is literally just a carbon bonded to four hydrogens, and if I actually wanted to draw it in a way that it kind of looks a little three-dimensional with a tetrahedral structure, it might look like this. This hydrogen is pointing out a little bit. This hydrogen is kind of in the plane of the page, and then maybe that hydrogen is behind it, and then you have one hydrogen popping up. That's methane. And we saw that these were all sp3 hybridized orbitals around the carbon, and then they each formed sigma bonds with each of the hydrogens. We saw that in the last video. And when we drew its electron configuration, in order for this to happen, carbon's electron configuration when bonding in methane needed to look like this. It needed to look like 1s2. And then instead of having 2s2 and then 2p2, what you essentially have is-- let me try it this way, actually, even better. Let me write this better. In 1s, you had two electrons, and then instead of two s's, you had two electrons and on each of the p's, you had one, the s's and the p's all got mixed up and you had a 2sp3 hybridized orbital, another 2sp3 hybridized orbital, another 2sp3 hybridized orbital, and then another one, sp3. Normally, when carbon's sitting by itself, you would expect a 2s here, and then you'd have a 2p in the x-direction, a 2p in the y-direction, and then a 2p in the z-direction. But we saw in the last video, they all get mixed up and they all have a 25% s-character, and a 75% p-character when carbon bonds in methane and the electrons kind of separate out in that situation. When you're dealing with the carbons in ethene, remember, eth- is for two carbons and ene-, because we're dealing with an alkene. We have a double bond here. In this situation, the carbon's electron configuration when they bond in ethene looks more like this. So you have your 1s, and the 1s orbital is still completely full. It has two electrons in it. But then in your 2 shell, I'll just write-- let me do this in a different color. So in our 2 shell, I'll show you what I mean in a second. I'm not writing the s or p's so far on purpose, but we're going to have four electrons just like we had before. We're still forming four bonds. We're going to have these four unpaired electrons. We're still forming one, two, three, four bonds with each of the carbons, so they're going to be separated out.  But in this situation, instead of all of them being a mixture, kind of one part s, three parts p, the s mixes with two of the p orbitals. So what you have is 2sp2 orbital. So you can imagine that the s orbital mixes with two of the p orbitals. So now it's one part s, two parts p. And then one of the p orbitals kind of stays by itself. And we need this p orbital to stay by itself because it is going to be what's responsible for the pi bond. And we're going to see that the pi bond does something very interesting to the molecule. It kind of makes it unrotatable around a bond axis. And you'll see what I mean in a second. So let me see if I can, in three dimensions, draw each of these carbons.  So you have-- let me do it a different color. You have this carbon right there. So let's say that's the nucleus. I'll put a C there so you know which carbon we're dealing with. And then I'll draw-- you could assume that the 1s orbital, it's really small right around the carbon. And then you have these hybridized orbitals, The 2sp2 orbitals, and they're all going to be planar, kind of forming a triangle, or I guess maybe a peace sign on some level, but I'll try to draw it in three dimensions here. So you have one, this is kind of coming out a little bit. Then you have one that's going in a little bit. And then you have-- and they have another lobe a little bit on the other side, but I'm not going to draw them. It'll complicate it. They still have characteristics of p, so they'll have two lobes, but one is bigger than the other. And then you have one that's maybe going in this side. So you can imagine that this is kind of a Mercedes sign if you drew a circle around it, on its side. So that's this carbon right here. And, of course, it has its hydrogens. So you have this hydrogen there. And so this hydrogen might be sitting right here. It just has one electron in its 1s orbital. You have this hydrogen up here. It's sitting right over there. And now let's draw this carbon.  This carbon will be sitting-- I'm drawing it pretty close together. This carbon will be sitting right there. He has his 1s orbital. They have the exact same electron configuration. He has his 1s orbital right around him, and then he has the exact same configuration. Either of these guys, we've so far only-- or in this first guy, I've only drawn these first three. I haven't drawn this unhybridized p orbital yet. So I'll do that in a second. But let me draw his bonds. So first of all, he has this, or you could imagine, that bond right there, which would be an sp2 hybridized bond. Let me do that in the same color. So he has this bond right here, which would be an sp2 hybridized bond, just like that. And notice, this is a sigma bond. They overlap in kind of the direction that they're pointing in. That's the best I could think about it. And then he's got these two hydrogens, so one-- he's got this guy in the back, and then there's one in the front. I'll draw it a little bigger so it's kind of pointing out at us, right? And then we have this hydrogen is sitting right over here. And these are also sigma bonds, just to be very clear about things. This is an s orbital overlapping with an sp2 orbital, but they're kind of overlapping in the direction that they're pointed, or kind of along the direction of each other, of the two atoms. This is a sigma bond, sigma bond, and then we have this hydrogen in the back, which is also 1going to form a sigma bond. 1So everything I've drawn so far is a sigma 1bond, so that, that. 1Maybe I don't want to make this picture too-- so I can 1just put sigma bond there, sigma bond there, sigma bond 1there, sigma, sigma. 1So far I've drawn this bond, this bond, this bond, this 1bond, and this bond, all of those sigma bonds. 1So, what happens to this last p orbital for 1each of these guys? 1Well, that's going to be kind of sticking out of the plane 1of the Mercedes sign, is the best way I can describe it. 1And let me see if I can do that in a color that I 1haven't done yet. 1Oh, maybe this purple color. 1So you can imagine a pure p orbital. 1So a pure p orbital, I'm going to need to draw it even bigger 1than that, actually. 1A pure p orbital, it normally wouldn't be that big relative 1to things, but I have to make them overlap. 1So it's a pure p orbital that's kind of going in, maybe 1you can imagine, the z-axis, that the other orbitals are 1kind of a Mercedes sign in the x, y plane. 1And now you have the z-axis going straight up and down, 1and those bottom two have to overlap so let 1me draw them bigger. 1 1So it looks like that and it looks like that. 1And they're going straight up and down. 1And notice, they are now overlapping. 1So this bond right here is this bond. 1I could've drawn them in either way, but it's that 1second bond. 1And so what's happening now to the structure? 1So let me make it very clear. 1This right here, that is a pi bond, and this right here is 1also-- it's the same pi bond. 1It's this guy right here. 1It's the second bond in the double bond. 1But what's happening here? 1Well, first of all, by itself it would be a weaker bond, but 1because we already have a sigma bond that's making these 1molecules come closer together, this pi bond will 1make them come even closer together. 1So this distance right here is closer than if we were to just 1have a single sigma bond there. 1Now, on top of that, the really interesting thing is, 1if we just had a sigma bond here, both of these molecules 1could kind of rotate around the bond axis. 1They would be able to rotate around the bond axis if you 1just had one sigma bond there. 1But since we have these pi bonds that are parallel to 1each other and they're kind of overlapping and they're kind 1of locked in to that configuration, you can no 1longer rotate. 1If one of these molecules rotates, the other one's going 1to rotate with it because these two 1guys are locked together. 1So what this pi bond does in the situation is it makes this 1carbon-carbon double bond-- it means that the double bonds 1are going to be rigid, that you can't have one molecule 1kind of flipping, swapping these two hydrogens, without 1the other one having to flip with it. 1So you wouldn't be able to kind of swap configurations of 1the hydrogens relative to the other side. 1That's what it causes. 1So, hopefully, that gives you a good understanding of the 1difference between sigma and pi bond. 1And if you're curious, when you're dealing with-- just to 1kind of make it clear, if we were dealing with ethyne, this 1is an example of ethene, but ethyne looks like this. 1You have a triple bond. 1And so you have each side pointing to one hydrogen. 1In this case, one of these, so the first bonds, you can 1imagine, so these bonds are all sigma bonds. 1They're actually sp hybridized. 1Your 2s orbital only mixes with one of the p's, so these 1are sp hybrid orbitals forming sigma bonds, so all of these 1right here. 1And then both of these-- let me do this in different color. 1Both of these are pi bonds. 1And if you had to imagine it, could imagine another pi bond 1kind of coming out of the page and another one here coming 1out of the page and into the page, out and into the page, 1and they, too, are overlapping, and you just have 1one hydrogen pointing out in each direction. 1Maybe I'll make another video on that. 1So, hopefully, you-- 1",science_organic-chemistry_gen-chem-review
" -  A meso compound is a compound that has chirality centers but is achiral. We're gonna come back to this definition in a few minutes. Right now, let's focus in on this drawing. And our goal is to draw all possible stereoisomers for this dot structure. So we know from earlier videos that this carbon is a chirality center, and so is this one. And we would expect two to the n stereoisomers, where n is the number of chirality centers. And since we have two chiral centers here, we would expect two to the second power, or four stereoisomers. So this is really just a maximum number, so I'm gonna put a question mark right here. So do we get four stereoisomers? Let's draw out the four possibilities. Our first stereoisomer could have both bromines coming out at us in space. So let me go ahead and draw that in. So we could have both bromines coming out at us. For the second possibility, we might have both bromines going away from us in space. So I'll draw that in there. For the third possibility, we could have one bromine up and one bromine down. So I'll put those in. And for the fourth, just reverse them. Have the top bromine down and the bottom bromine up. like that. Well, all right, let's examine the relationships between our stereoisomers. And let's start with stereoisomer possibility three and four. So let's compare these and let's figure out the relationship. On the left is stereoisomer three. We can see there's a bromine coming at us and a bromine going away from us. On the right is stereoisomer four. Now we have a bromine going away from us at the top carbon and a bromine coming out at us here. So let's compare our two stereoisomers. If I rotate the one on the right, we can see these are mirror images of each other. And if I try to superimpose one on top of the other, here we get one pair of bromines to line up, but the other pair doesn't match. If we try to get the other pair of bromines to line up, now the first pair doesn't match. So these are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. These are etiomers. So three and four are etiomers. They are non-superimposable mirror images. And we could have guessed that by looking at the drawing, because at this carbon we have bromine coming out at us in space, and then now we have bromine going away from us in space for the other stereoisomer. So that's an opposite configuration at that carbon. And at this carbon, we go from a dash to a wedge. So that's an opposite configuration at this one too. So since we have opposite configurations at all chirality centers, we would expect these two to be etiomers of each other. What about the relationship between one and two? Well, at first we might say oh, those are etiomers because here we have a wedge, and then over here we have a dash and here we have a wedge, and here we have a dash. So that should be the opposite configuration at both chirality centers. So those might be etiomers. But let's go to the video to see if that's true. On the left is a model of drawing one, with the two bromines coming out at us in space. On the right is a model of drawing two, with the two bromines going away from us in space. And if I rotate the model on the right, we can see that these are mirror images of each other. But they are superimposable mirror images. So if I put that one on top of the other, you'll see that they are superimposable. So these actually are two models of the same molecule. This is a meso compound. It's a compound that has chirality centers, but it is achiral, the mirror image is superimposable. So one and two really represent the same molecule. This is a meso compound, a compound that has chirality centers but is achiral. The mirror image is superimposable on itself. So we thought we would have four stereoisomers, but really we only have three. We have a pair of etiomers and we have one meso compound. So to look for a meso compound, one thing you could do is what we did in the video. We had the mirror image and we were able to superimpose the mirror image on itself. Another way to look for a meso compound is to look for a plane of symmetry. So if I draw a line here, think about this as being a plane, and look for symmetry on either side. So you can see, it's symmetrical. I drew in the plane of symmetry with a dashed line here, but it's hard to visualize it. So up here is a better picture. Here you can see the plane dividing the molecule in half. And on the left side, we have our bonds here and then we have our bromine going up and our hydrogen going down. The right side is symmetrical with the left side. So look for symmetry on both sides of the plane. Let's do another example. This one's a little bit harder than the last one. We know that we have two chiral centers. So that's a chiral center and so is this one. So we would expect two to the second stereoisomer. So that's, of course, four. So I'll put a question mark here again because we're not sure if we actually will get four stereoisomers. That's a maximum number. Down here I have the four possibilities. So I've drawn them out just to save some time. So we have one, two, three and four. And let's examine the relationship between one and two first. On the left is stereoisomer one, and I've left the hydrogens off the methyl groups and the OH just so we can see the models better. So here's our carbon chain, and we have both OHs coming out at us in space. And then for stereoisomer two, here's the carbon chain, and we have both OHs going away from us. So I'm gonna hold them in the way they are in the drawing and I'm gonna rotate the one on the right. And when I do that, we can see that these are mirror images of each other. But if I try to superimpose one on the other, so I'll just rotate this one back here and flip it over, you can see they don't match up. So the atoms don't line up here. So they're non-superimposable. Doesn't matter how you do it. I'll rotate it again, and we can see we can't superimpose our atoms. So these are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. These are etiomers. And we could check for a plane of symmetry, so I could take one of these and I can rotate it so we have our hydrogens going away from us in space. And I look for a plane of symmetry, but I don't see one. So this is not a meso compound. So one and two are etiomers. They're non-superimposable mirror images of each other. And we could've guessed that because if we look at our chiral centers here, so this one has an OH coming out at us, and then that one has it going away from us, this one has an OH coming out at us and this one has it going away from us, so we have opposite configurations at both chirality centers. Let's look at three and four next. So what is the relationship between these two? Well, first, we might think these could be etiomers because at this carbon, we have OH on a wedge, and then here we have OH on a dash. And then here we have OH on a dash, and here we have it on a wedge. So that might be your first guess. But let's look at the video and let's look at the model sets to help us out. Remember, I'm leaving the hydrogens off the methyl groups and the hydrogens off the oxygens in the video just to help us see the molecule more clearly. On the left, we have a model of drawing three. So here's our carbon chain with an OH going away from us in space, and an OH coming out at us in space. On the right is a model of drawing four. Here's our carbon chain with an OH coming out at us in space and an OH going away from us in space. So I'll hold the two models and we'll compare them. First let's see if they are mirror images of each other. So I'll take the one on the right and I'll rotate it and I'll hold it up next to the one on the left. And now we can see that these two are mirror images of each other. So next, let's see if one is superimposable on the other. So I'll go back to the starting point and I'll rotate it around like that, and let's see if we can superimpose the one on the right, the mirror image, on the molecule on the left. And notice that we can. All of the atoms line up. So all of the hydrogens, carbons and oxygens are in the same place. So this is a compound that has chirality centers, but it is achiral, the mirror image is superimposable on itself. So we should be able to find a plane of symmetry. So I'll just pick one of these models, doesn't matter which one because they represent the same compound, and I'll rotate, I'll rotate it around so we can see a plane of symmetry. So right there is our plane of symmetry. This is a meso compound. So three and four actually represent the same compound. So this is one meso compound. So these two are the same, and we have one meso compound. It's not really obvious looking at these bond line structures that these represent the same molecule. So definitely get a model set and try this out for yourself. So we thought there might be four stereoisomers, but actually there are only three. We have a pair of etiomers, and we have one meso compound.",science_organic-chemistry_stereochemistry-topic
" Let's talk about oxygen content. And I'm going to actually spell it out two ways. One is the full word oxygen content, or the full term. And I'm also going to give you the shorthand, way you might see. Sometimes it's written this way, CaO2. And the C is the content. The little a is arterial. And the O2 is oxygen. So what it means exactly and the way we think of it as, how much oxygen is there. How much is there? And we measure it in milliliters, per 100 milliliters of blood. So per 100 ml. and. Sometimes you might see deciliter instead of milliliter. Let me just quickly jot that down. That equals 1 deciliter per 100 milliliters of blood. So this is the definition. Now, let's use this definition right away. Let's see if you can think through this idea. So let's imagine I go down and I decide to get 1 pint of blood taken from my left arm. Let's, instead of bint, let me write pint. And this is my left arm. And let's say I'm in a huge rush this day. So I decide that I also want to get another needle stuck in my right arm. And they also draw blood out of my right arm, at the same moment, the same time. So the same kind of blood, same hemoglobin concentration, and same amount of oxygen in my lungs when I was getting the blood drawn. Except for some reason, maybe this needle, this second one was larger. And they were able to get more blood out-- 2 pints. Now, some smart wise guy walks by and says, hey, which side, your left or your right, were you're able to get a higher oxygen content from. Now, just looking at the picture, you might be tempted to say, well, oxygen content. Sounds like the right side is the winner. But actually, this is kind of a trick question because it's per 100 milliliters. So you got remember, it's a certain volume that we're thinking about. And in this case, since we know that the blood was drawn at the same moment from my two arms. And I have no reason to believe that the left versus right had a higher oxygen saturation. I would say, actually probably the two had the same oxygen content. That would be my guess based on this set up. So that's one important thing to remember that it's per 100 ml. So let's just keep that in mind. And now let me actually just jot down for you the exact equation, kind of the formula. If want to mathematically calculate oxygen content, how would that look? Well, CaO2 is quicker to write. So let me just jot that down. And the units on this are milliliters of oxygen per, I said, 100 milliliters of blood. So these are the units here. And this is going to equal-- to figure this out, I need to know the hemoglobin concentration. And there it's the grams of hemoglobin per 100 milliliters of blood. And then, I have to multiply this by a constant. And the constant is 1.34. And what that number is, is it's telling me the milliliters of oxygen that I can expect to bind for each gram of hemoglobin. So that's actually quite a nice little number to have handy because now you can see that the units are about to cancel. This will cancel with this. And I end up with our correct units. But there's one more thing I have to add in here which is the oxygen saturation. Remember, this O2 saturation. And if I know the O2 saturation, remember, there's this nice little curve. This is O2 saturation. And if I'm looking at just the arterial side, I could write, S little a O2. And I could compare to the partial pressure in the arterial side of oxygen. And remember, we have these little S-shaped curves. These S-shaped curves. And all I want to point out is that, for any increase in my PaO2, in the partial pressure of oxygen, I'm going to have an increase in the O2 saturation. So there's an actual relationship there. And we usually measure this in percentage. Percentage of oxygen that is bound to hemoglobin. And so this is the same thing here, as a certain percentage. So this whole top part of the formula, then, this whole bit in my brackets really is telling me about hemoglobin bound to oxygen. Now remember, that's not the only way that oxygen actually travels in the blood. Let me write out this second way that oxygen likes to get around. And the second way is when it dissolves in the blood. So this is all going to be plus. And the second part of the equation is the partial pressure of oxygen. And this is measured in millimeters of mercury. So that's the unit. And this is times, now this is another constant, 0.003. And then, keep track of the units here because we have to end up with these units. So you know everything has to cancel out to end up with that. So I have milliliters of oxygen on top. And I'm going to want to cancel my millimeters of mercury. So take that times 100 milliliters of blood. So these are the units on the bottom. And they end up the same as we just worked through. We've got this crosses out with that. And my units are going to end up perfect. And this bottom bit, that I'm going to put in purple brackets. This bit tells me about dissolved oxygen. So I have my oxygen bound to hemoglobin. And I have my dissolved oxygen. These are the two parts of my formula. So let me actually just quickly, before I move on, circle in blue, then, the important parts that I want you keep your eyeballs on. There is the total O2 content, hemoglobin, oxygen saturation, and partial pressure of oxygen. And remember, this guy influences this guy. And we saw that on the O2 curve that I just drew. Let me just bring it up again, so I can remind you what I'm talking about. In this graph, you can see how the two are related. There's a very nice relationship between the two. So this is my formula for calculating the total oxygen content. So let's actually use this formula. Let's think through this. And when I think through it, I always go through all of my four variables. Let me just jot them down here. So we keep track of them. Let's do PaO2, SaO2, and then hemoglobin and the total oxygen content. These are my four variables. Now, let's do a little problem together. Let me make a little bit of space. And let's say I have two little containers. And the first container, this first one is full of blood. Here's a B for blood. And here's a second container full of plasma. Remember, plasma is a part of the blood. But it's not all of the blood. Plasma specifically does not have any red blood cells or any hemoglobin. So let me just write that down. No hemoglobin in the plasma side. Just to make sure we don't lose track of that fact. Now, plasma is yellow colored. So let me just make it yellow colored here. Make sure we clearly see that that's plasma. And blood I'm going to keep as a red color. So now, we have our two containers full of plasma and blood. So now, let's say, I decide to increase the partial pressure of oxygen in the air. So it's going to diffuse in here. And it's going to diffuse in here. So I increase the partial pressure oxygen in the air. And it's going to diffuse into those two liquids. It's going to dissolve into those liquids. So my question is, as we go through one by one, each of these four variables, I want you to think through if they go up, if they go down, or if they stay the same. So let's start with the first one, PaO2. Well, if the oxygen is going to diffuse into those liquids, then I would say the partial pressure of oxygen in the liquid would go up. Now, it's a little bit confusing to use the words PaO2 in this case, or even down here, CaO2 or SaO2. Because we're not really talking about arterial blood here. We're just talking about blood. And we're not talking about arterial plasma. We're just talking a plasma because there's no artery connected to these two tanks of fluid. But the concept is the same. So the partial pressure of oxygen is going to go up in the blood. And it's going to go up in the plasma because it just dissolves into those liquids. Now, what about saturation of oxygen? Well, O2 saturation goes up in the blood. Remember, there's a relationship, we said, between PaO2 and oxygen saturation. So it's going to cause the SaO2 to go up here. Whereas on the plasma side there is no hemoglobin. So of course, there's going to be no change here. I would say, not applicable because there is no hemoglobin. So how could you have an oxygen saturation curve for hemoglobin? Now, what about the third variable, 1hemoglobin concentration? 1Remember, that was grams per 100 milliliters of blood. 1Well, I'm not talking about adding or subtracting 1hemoglobin. 1So there should be no change here. 1I'll write, no change. 1And on the other side of the plasma side, 1again, there is no hemoglobin. 1So it's not going to affect that at all. 1It's not really applicable. 1Plasma, again, does not have hemoglobin. 1So in terms of the total oxygen content, or the CaO2, 1what I expected to go up in the blood, 1definitely, it's definitely going 1to go up because the dissolved part of the equation goes up. 1But even the hemoglobin bound to oxygen part of the equation 1goes up because we said, the SaO2 went up. 1That's an interesting point. 1On the other side on the plasma side, it also increases. 1But only a little bit because here you only 1have the contribution from the PaO2. 1You have no contribution from any 1of the oxygen bound to hemoglobin 1because, again, there is no hemoglobin. 1So this problem illustrates some of the ideas, 1specifically around trying to tie-in 1an increase in the partial pressure of oxygen 1to how that could affect the saturation of oxygen.",science_health-and-medicine_advanced-hematologic-system
" Let's graph ourselves some inequalities. So let's say I had the inequality y is less than or equal to 4x plus 3. On our xy coordinate plane, we want to show all the x and y points that satisfy this condition right here. So a good starting point might be to break up this less than or equal to, because we know how to graph y is equal to 4x plus 3. So this thing is the same thing as y could be less than 4x plus 3, or y could be equal to 4x plus 3. That's what less than or equal means. It could be less than or equal. And the reason why I did that on this first example problem is because we know how to graph that. So let's graph that. Try to draw a little bit neater than that. So that is-- no, that's not good. So that is my vertical axis, my y-axis. This is my x-axis, right there. And then we know the y-intercept, the y-intercept is 3. So the point 0, 3-- 1, 2, 3-- is on the line. And we know we have a slope of 4. Which means if we go 1 in the x-direction, we're going to go up 4 in the y. So 1, 2, 3, 4. So it's going to be right here. And that's enough to draw a line. We could even go back in the x-direction. If we go 1 back in the x-direction, we're going to go down 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. So that's also going to be a point on the line. So my best attempt at drawing this line is going to look something like-- this is the hardest part. It's going to look something like that. That is a line. It should be straight. I think you get the idea. That right there is the graph of y is equal to 4x plus 3. So let's think about what it means to be less than. So all of these points satisfy this inequality, but we have more. This is just these points over here. What about all these where y ix less than 4x plus 3? So let's think about what this means. Let's pick up some values for x. When x is equal to 0, what does this say? When x is equal to 0, then that means y is going to be less than 0 plus 3. y is less than 3. When x is equal to negative 1, what is this telling us? 4 times negative 1 is negative 4, plus 3 is negative 1. y would be less than negative 1. When x is equal to 1, what is this telling us? 4 times 1 is 4, plus 3 is 7. So y is going to be less than 7. So let's at least try to plot these. So when x is equal to-- let's plot this one first. When x is equal to 0, y is less than 3. So it's all of these points here-- that I'm shading in in green-- satisfy that right there. If I were to look at this one over here, when x is negative 1, y is less than negative 1. So y has to be all of these points down here. When x is equal to 1, y is less than 7. So it's all of these points down here. And in general, you take any point x-- let's say you take this point x right there. If you evaluate 4x plus 3, you're going to get the point on the line. That is that x times 4 plus 3. Now the y's that satisfy it, it could be equal to that point on the line, or it could be less than. So it's going to go below the line. So if you were to do this for all the possible x's, you would not only get all the points on this line which we've drawn, you would get all the points below the line. So now we have graphed this inequality. It's essentially this line, 4x plus 3, with all of the area below it shaded. Now, if this was just a less than, not less than or equal sign, we would not include the actual line. And the convention to do that is to actually make the line a dashed line. This is the situation if we were dealing with just less than 4x plus 3. Because in that situation, this wouldn't apply, and we would just have that. So the line itself wouldn't have satisfied it, just the area below it. Let's do one like that. So let's say we have y is greater than negative x over 2 minus 6. So a good way to start-- the way I like to start these problems-- is to just graph this equation right here. So let me just graph-- just for fun-- let me graph y is equal to-- this is the same thing as negative 1/2 minus 6. So if we were to graph it, that is my vertical axis, that is my horizontal axis. And our y-intercept is negative 6. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So that's my y-intercept. And my slope is negative 1/2. Oh, that should be an x there, negative 1/2 x minus 6. So my slope is negative 1/2, which means when I go 2 to the right, I go down 1. So if I go 2 to the right, I'm going to go down 1. If I go 2 to the left, if I go negative 2, I'm going to go up 1. So negative 2, up 1. So my line is going to look like this. My line is going to look like that. That's my best attempt at drawing the line. So that's the line of y is equal to negative 1/2 x minus 6. Now, our inequality is not greater than or equal, it's just greater than negative x over 2 minus 6, or greater than negative 1/2 x minus 6. So using the same logic as before, for any x-- so if you take any x, let's say that's our particular x we want to pick-- if you evaluate negative x over 2 minus 6, you're going to get that point right there. You're going to get the point on the line. But the y's that satisfy this inequality are the y's greater than that. So it's going to be not that point-- in fact, you draw an open circle there-- because you can't include the point of negative 1/2 x minus 6. But it's going to be all the y's greater than that. That'd be true for any x. You take this x. You evaluate negative 1/2 or negative x over 2 minus 6, you're going to get this point over here. The y's that satisfy it are all the y's above that. So all of the y's that satisfy this equation, or all of the coordinates that satisfy this equation, is this entire area above the line. And we're not going to include the line. So the convention is to make this line into a dashed line. And let me draw-- I'm trying my best to turn it into a dashed line. I'll just erase sections of the line, and hopefully it will look dashed to you. So I'm turning that solid line into a dashed line to show that it's just a boundary, but it's not included in the coordinates that satisfy our inequality. The coordinates that satisfy our equality are all of this yellow stuff that I'm shading above the line. Anyway, hopefully you found that helpful.",math_in-in-grade-11-ncert_in-in-class11-linear-inequalities
" In the last video we defined the notion of a determit of a 2 by 2 matrix. So if I have some matrix-- let's just call it B-- if my matrix B looks like this, if its entries are a, b, c, d, we've defined to determit of B. Which could also be written as B with these lines around it, which could also be written as the entries of the matrix with those lines around it, a, b, c, d. And I don't want you to get these confused. This is the matrix when you have the brackets. This is the determit of the matrix, when you just have these straight lines. And this, by definition, was equal to ad minus bc. And you saw in the last video, or maybe you saw in the last video, what the motivation for this came from. When we figured out the inverse of B, we determined that it was equal to 1 over ad minus bc times another matrix, which was essentially these two entry swaps, you got a d and an a. And then these two entries made negative, so minus c and minus b. This was the inverse of b. And we said, well, when is this defined? This is defined as long as this character right here does not equal 0. So you said hey, this looks pretty important. Let's call this thing right there the determit. And then we could say that B is invertible, if and only if, the determit of B does not equal 0. Because if it equals 0, then this formula for your inverse won't be well defined. And we just got this from our technique of creating an augmented matrix whatnot. But the big take away is we defined this notion of a determit it for a 2 by 2 matrix. Now the next question is, well that's just a 2 by 2, everything we do in linear algebra, we like to generalize it to higher numbers of rows and columns. So the next step, at least-- let's just do baby steps-- let's start with a 3 by 3. Let's define what its determit is. So let me construct a 3 by 3 matrix here. Let's say my matrix A is equal to-- let me just write its entries-- first row, first column, first row, second column, first row, third column. Then you have a2 1, a2 2, a2 3. Then you have a3 1, third row first column, a3 2, and then a3 3. That is a 3 by 3 matrix. Three rows and three columns. This is 3 by 3. I am going to define the determit of A. So this is a definition. I'm going to define the determit of this 3 by 3 matrix A as being equal to-- and this is a little bit convoluted, but you'll get the hang of it eventually. In the next several videos we're just going to do a ton of determits. So it just becomes a bit of second nature to you. It's a little computationally intensive sometimes. But it equals this first row. It equals a1 1 times the determit of the matrix you get, if you get rid of this guy's column and row. So if you get rid of this guy's column and row, you're left with this matrix here. So times the determit of the matrix a2 2, a2 3, a3 2, and then a3 3. Just like that. So that's our first entry and that's a plus this. And then I said it's a plus this, because the next entry's going to be a minus. You have a minus this guy right here. So then you're going to have minus a1 2 times the matrix you get if you eliminate his column and his row. So times, you're going to get these entries right there. So a2 1, a2 3, a3 1, and then you have a3 3. We're not quite done. You could probably guess with the next one's going to be. Then you're going to have a plus-- let me switch to a better color-- plus this guy. Plus a1 3 times the determit of its-- I guess you could call it-- its sub-matrix. We'll call it that for now. So this matrix right here. So a2 1, a2 2, a3 1, a3 2. This is our definition of the determit of a 3 by 3 matrix. And the motivation is, because when you take the determit of a 3 by 3 it turns out-- I haven't shown it to you yet-- that the property is the same. That if the determit of this is 0, you will not be able to find an inverse. And when I defined determit in this way. If the determit does not equal 0, you will be able to find an inverse. So that's where this came from. And I haven't shown you that yet. And I might not show you because it's super computational. It'll take a long time. It'll be very hairy and I'll make careless mistakes. But the motivation comes from the exact same place as the 2 by 2 version. But I think what you probably want to see right now is at least just this thing applied to an actual matrix, because this looks all abstract right now. But if we do it with an actual matrix, you'll actually see it's not too bad. So let's leave the definition up there, and let's say that I have the matrix 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, minus 1, 3, and 4, 0, 1. So by our definition of a determit, the determit of this guy right here-- so let's say I call that matrix C-- C is equal to that. So if we want to figure out the determit of C, the determit of C is equal to-- I take this guy right here, let me take that 1-- times the determit of-- let's just call it the submatrix, right here. So we have a minus 1, we have a 3, we have a 0, and we have a 1. Just like that. Notice, I got rid of this guy's column and this guy's row. And I was just left with minus 1, 3, 0, 1. Next, I take this guy. And this is the trick. You have to alternate signs. If you start with a positive here, this next one's going to be a minus. So you're going to have minus 2 times the submatrix-- we can call it-- if we get rid of this guy's column and this guy's row. So 2, 3, 4, 1. I just blanked this out. If I could videotape my finger, I would cover my finger over this column right here and over that row, and you'd just see a 2, a 3, a 4, and a 1. And that's what I put right there. And then finally, we went plus, minus, plus. So finally, we'll have plus 4 times the determit of the submatrix, if you get rid of that row in that column. So 2, minus 1, 4, 0. Now, these are pretty straightforward. These are not too bad to compute. Let's actually do it. So this is going to be equal to 1 times what? Minus 1 times 1. Let me just write it out. Minus 1 times 1, minus 0 times 3. This just comes from the definition of a 2 by 2 determit. We've already defined that. And then we're going to have a minus 2 times 2 times 1, minus 4 times 3. And then finally, we're going to have a plus 4 times 2 times 0 minus minus 1 times 4. I wrote it all out so you can see. This thing right here is just this thing right here. And then you have the 4 out front. This thing right here was just this thing right here. So it's the determit of the 2 by 2 submatrix for each of these guys. And if we compute this, this is equal to-- minus 1 times 1 is minus 1. Minus 0, that's 0. So this is a minus 1 times 1, so that's a minus 1. And then we get-- what is this equal to? This right here is 12. So you get 2 minus 12. Right? You get 2 times 1 minus 4 times 3. So it's minus 10. So that is equal to minus 10. And then you have a minus 10 times a minus 2. So that becomes a plus 20, right? Minus 2 times minus 10. And then finally, in the green, we have 2 times 0, that's just a 0. And then you have minus 1 times 4, which is minus 4. Then you have a minus sign here, so it's plus 4. So this all becomes a plus 4. Plus 4 times 4 is 16, so plus 16. And what do we get when we add this up? We get 20 plus 16 minus 1. It is equal to 35. We're done. We found the determit of our 3 by 3 matrix. Not too bad. Right there, so that is equal to the determit of C. So the fact that this isn't 0 tells you that C is invertible. In the next video, we'll try to extend this to n by n square matrices.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-determinants
" Welcome to the video on basic subtraction. Let's do a little bit a review of basic addition first. If I said 4 plus 3, what did this mean? What did that equal? Well, there were a couple of ways we could have viewed this. We could have said I had 4 of something. Let's say I had 4 circles or I don't know, I had 4 lemons for breakfast. So 1, 2, 3, 4 lemons for breakfast. And let's say, I had another 3 lemons for lunch. 1, 2, 3, and so you could view 4 plus 3 as how many total lemons did I have? I'm adding 3 to 4. So how many total did I have? Well, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So I had a total of 7 lemons. Another way we could have viewed that is we could have drawn our number line. And I'll draw it in yellow because-- now that's not wide enough. I'll draw it in yellow because we're talking about lemons. So let's say that's our number line. And if I start at the number-- let me draw all of the numbers. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So you could think about this as saying, well, we're on the number line. We start at the number 4. That's this number 4. And we're adding 3 to it. So we'll increase, along the number line by 3. So we'll go 1, 2, 3 and you end up at 7. So you could say if I have 4 and I get 3 more, I get 7. Or if I increase 4 by 3 I also get 7. So what's subtraction now? Because that's what this video is about. I shouldn't waste all of our time talking about addition. So let's take the example of 4 minus 3. What is that equal to? Let me switch colors just to keep things interesting. So what is 4 minus 3 equal to? Subtraction or minus is the opposite of addition. So in addition you're doing something more, you're adding. I don't want to use the word adding to define addition, but that's what you're doing. I had 4 lemons and then I had 3 more. In subtraction you're taking away. So this example, if I started with 4 lemons, let's say I had 4 lemons on a plate. If I'm subtracting 3, if I'm saying minus 3, instead of adding these 3 and getting 7, I'm going to take 3 away. So maybe I'm eating them or maybe I'm giving them to you in exchange for watching these videos. So to take away 3 from this 4, let's say this one goes away, this one goes away, and this one goes away. How many lemons would we have left? Well, this is the only one that I haven't crossed out. So we would have 1 lemon left. And this would be the lemon that's left. Didn't have to be that one, I could have crossed out any of the 3. Another way to view that, let's draw the same lemon colored number line. Let's say that this is the number line right here. And I'll draw all the same numbers. So that's 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Of course, the number line keeps going. There's no largest number. And you can imagine, any number that you can think of, I can think of one higher than that. So there is no largest number. So that's why we draw that arrow there. I could never draw the entire number line. But anyway, back to subtraction. So we're starting at 4 lemons, right? When we added 3-- plus 3-- we went to the right 4 spaces on the number line. And that's because the right is increasing value. So we went from 4 to 5. That was one more. 5 to 6 was two more, and 7 was 3 more. Now we're taking away from 4. So what do we do? What would you think we do? Well, since we're taking away we're going to decrease the total number of lemons we have. So we take away one, we get to 3. Take away two, get to 2. Take away three, we took away three, right? So we'll go back 1, 2, 3 along the number line and we'll end up at 1. And that's this 1 right here. So just to review, addition is you're doing more or something. Subtraction is you are taking away. If you think about it on the number line, addition is increasing along the number line by that amount. So in this case we increased along the number line by 3. And so we went from 4 to 7. In the subtraction case we decrease back on the number line. So we decrease by the amount that you're subtracting. So in this case we decreased by 3. We went back 1, 2, 3 and we had 1. And the other way to view it, if I have 4 of something. If I give 3 away or if I ate 3 of them or I don't know what I did to 3 of them. If I lost 3 of them I would have 1 left. Now let me show you some interesting things about subtraction. So we know that 4 minus 3 is equal to 1. Let me show you something else that's interesting. What is 4 minus 1? Well, we could use either example. Let's do the lemon example. Let's do apples now; I'm bored of the lemons. Let's say I 1, 2, 3, 4. I have a new pen, sometimes it doesn't draw right. Let's say I had 4 apples. This is the example we're dealing with. And I were to eat one of them. So one of them were to go away. How many apples would I have left? Well, 3-- 1, 2, 3. So 4 minus 1 is equal to 3. And if we did it on the number line, if we started at 4 and we subtracted 1-- we took 1 away. So we're going to become one smaller. We go back one, we get 3. Either way works. But isn't this interesting? 4 minus 3 is equal to 1 and 4 minus 1 is equal to 3. You might say, well, did I pick the numbers just so it worked? Well, it turns out that it's always true. Well, I don't want to get too technical, but we're already touching on something that you'll learn later, maybe in algebra one day. But actually I don't want to go into all that right now. So where does this come from? Well, this is also based on the fact that 3 plus 1-- I didn't want to confuse you. So I apologize if I did. But I'll show you another interesting thing. What is 3 plus 1? 3 plus 1 is equal to what? Well, that's easy. You know that from basic addition. You can start on the number line at 3 and add 1 do it. And where do you end up? You end up at 4. 3 plus 1 is equal to 4. Or you could have started at 1 on the number line and added 3. 1, 2, 3 and you would have also ended up at 4. So we also know that you could have switch this either way. Both of those are equal 4. What do you see here? Well, there's a bunch of things I've written here and they all kind of relate to each other. 1 plus 3 is equal to 4. 3 plus 1 is equal to 4. 4 minus 1 is 3. Essentially, 4 minus 1 and getting 3 is the exact same-- you're saying the same thing as 3 plus 1 is equal to 4. This statement says if I add 1 to 3 I get 4. This is saying if I take away 1 from 4 I get 3. So if I start at 4, move back, I get 3. This is saying if I start at 3, and I move up 1, I get 4. Hopefully that gives you a little bit of intuition about what subtraction is. In the next video I'll just do as many basic subtraction problems I can do in 10 minutes. And then you'll be ready to do the exercises. See you soon.",math_arithmetic-home_addition-subtraction
" SAL: The notion of a half-life is useful, if we're dealing with increments of time that are multiples of a half-life. For example, where time equals zero, we have 100% of our substance. Then after time equals one half-life, we'd have 50% of our substance. At time is equal to two half-lives, we'd have 25% of our substance, and so on and so forth. So if I say that three half-lives have gone by-- in the case of carbon that would be, what, roughly 15,000 years-- I can tell you roughly, or almost exactly, what percentage of my original element I still have. In the case of carbon-14, I'll tell you what percentage of my original carbon-14 has not decayed into nitrogen, as yet, nitrogen-14. And that's useful, but what if I care about how much carbon I have after 1/2 a year, or after 1/2 a half life, or after three billion years, or after 10 minutes? What if I want a general function. A general function, as a function of time, that tells me the number, or the amount, of my decaying substance I have. So that's what we're going to do in this video. And it's going to be a little mathy, but I think the math is pretty straightforward, especially if you've taken a first-year course in calculus. And this is actually a pretty neat application of it. So let's just think a little bit about the rate of change, or the probability, or the number particles that are changing at any given time. So if we say, the difference or change in our number of particles, or the amount of particles, in any very small period of time, what's this going to be dependent on? This is the number particles we have in a given period time. This is our rate of change. So one thing, we know that our rate of change is going down. We know it's a negative number. We know that, in the case of radioactive decay, I could do the same exercise with compounding growth, where I would say, oh no, it's not a negative number, that our growth is dependent on how much we have. In this case the amount we're decaying is proportional, but it's going to be the negative of how much of the actual compound we already have. Let me explain that. So what I'm saying is, look, our amount of decay is proportional to the amount of the substance that we already are dealing with. And just to maybe make that a little bit more intuitive, imagine a situation here where you have 1 times 10 to the 9th. You have a billion carbon atoms. And let's say over here you have 1 times 10 to the 6th carbon atoms. And if you look at it at over some small period of time, let's say, if you look at it over one second, let's say our dt. dt as an infinitesimally small time, but let's say it's a change in time. It's a delta t. And let's say over one second, you observe that this sample had, I don't know, let's say you saw 1000 carbon particles. You really wouldn't see that with carbon-14, but this is just for the sake of our intuition. Let's say over one second you saw 1000 carbon particles per second here. Well here you have 1000th of the number particles in this sample as this one. So, for every thousand particles you saw decaying here, you'd really expect to see one carbon particle per second here. Just because you have a smaller amount. Now I don't know what the actual constant is. But we know that no matter what substance we're talking about, this constant is dependent on the substance. Carbon's going to be different from uranium, is going to be different from, you know, we looked at radon. They're all going to have different quantities right here. And we can see that. We'll actually do it in the next video, you can actually calculate this from the half-life. But the rate of change is always going to be dependent on the number of particles you have, right? I mean, we saw that here with half-life. When you have 1/2 the number of particles, you lose 1/2 as much. Here, if we start with 100 particles here, we went to 50 particles, then we went to 25. When you start with 50, in a period of time you lose 25. When you start with 100, you lose 50. So clearly the amount you lose is dependent on the amount you started with, right? Over any fraction of time, and here it's a very small fraction. So what I set up here is really fairly simple, but it doesn't sound so simple to a lot of people if you say it's a differential equation. We can actually solve this using pretty straightforward techniques. This is actually a separation of variables problem. And so, what can we do? Let's divide both sides by N. We want to get all the N's on this side and all the t stuff on the other side. So if we have 1 over N, dN over dt is equal to minus lambda. I just divided both sides of this by N. And then I can multiply both sides of this by dt, and I get 1 over N dN is equal to minus lambda dt. Now I can take the integral of both sides of this equation. And what do I get? What's the antiderivative? I'm taking the indefinite integral or the antiderivative. What's the antiderivative of 1 over N? Well that's the natural log of N plus some constant-- I'll just do that in blue-- plus some constant. And then that equals-- What's the antiderivative of just some constant? Well it's just that constant times the derivative, the variable. We're taking the antiderivative with respect to. So minus lambda, times t, plus some constant. These are different constants, but they're arbitrary. So if we want, we can just subtract that constant from that constant, and put them all on one side and then we just get another constant. So this boils down to our solution to our differential equation is the natural log of N is equal to minus lambda-t, plus some other constant, I call it c3, it doesn't matter. And now if we want to just make this a function of N in terms of t, let's take both of these, or both take e to the power of both sides of this. You can view that as kind of the inverse natural log. So e to the power of ln of N, ln of N is just saying what power do you raise e to to get to N? So if you raise e to that power, you get N. So I'm just raising both sides of this equation. I'm raising e to both sides of this equation. e to the ln of N is just N. And that is equal to e to the minus lambda-t, plus c3. And now this can be rewritten as, N is equal to e to the minus lambda-t, times e to the c3. And now once again this is an arbitrary constant, so we can just really rename that as, I don't know, let me rename it as c4. So, our solution to our differential equation, N, as a function of t, is equal to our c4 constant, c4e to the minus lambda-t. Now let's say, even better, let's say is N equals 0. Let's say that N equals 0. We have N sub 0 of our sample. That's how much we're starting off with. So let's see if we can substitute that into our equation to solve for c4. So we said N sub-0 is equal to, let's put 0 in here, so let's see, that's equal to N sub naught. And that's equal to c4 times e to the minus lambda, times 0. Well, minus anything times 0 is 0. So it's e to the 0. So that's just 1. So c4 is equal to N naught, our starting amount for the sample. So we've actually got an expression. We have the number of particles, or the amount as a function of t, is equal to the amount that we start off with, at time is equal to 0, times e to the minus lambda, times time. And we just have to be careful that we're always using the time constant when we solve for the different coefficients. So this seems all abstract. How does this relate to half-life? Well let's try to figure out this equation for carbon. This'll be true for anything where we have radioactive decay. If we actually had a plus sign here it'd be exponential growth as well. We know that carbon, c-14, has a 5,700-year half-life. So the way you could think about it, is if at time equals 0 you start off with t-- So time equals 0. t equals-- let me write that down. If at N of 0 is equal to-- and we could write 100 there if we want. Actually why don't we do that? If N of 0 we start off with 100. And then at N of 5,700 years-- so we're going to take t to be in years, you just have to be consistent with your units-- how much will we have left? We'll have 50 left. We could have written x and x over two here, and it would have all have worked out in the end. So let's see, let's apply that to this equation and try to solve this for lambda. So we know N of 0 is equal to 100. So we immediately know that we can write this equation as N of t is equal to 100e, to the minus lambda-t, at least in this exact circumstance. 1And we also know that N of 5,700-- so that means, N of 15,700-- that is equal to, we just said, that's one 1half-life away. 1So we have 1/2 as much of our compound left. 1That's equal to 50, which is equal to the 5,700th power 1times lambda. 1So it's equal to 100 times e, to the minus 1lambda, times 5,700. 1And now we just solve for lambda. 1Then we'll have a general equation for how much carbon 1we have at any given moment in time. 1So if you divide both sides of this by 100. 1What do we get? 1We get 0.5, we have 1/2, is equal to e to the-- let me 1just write minus 5,700 lambda, and then we could take the 1natural log of both sides. 1So then we get-- scroll down a bit-- the natural log of 1/2 1is equal to the-- the natural log of this is just minus 15,700 lambda. 1To solve for lambda, you get lambda is equal to the natural 1log of 1/2, over minus 5,700. 1So let me see what that is. 1Let's see what that is. 1So 0.5 natural log is that, divided by minus 5,700. 15,700 negative is equal to 1.2 times 10 to the negative 4. 1Is equal to 1.21 times 10 to the minus 4. 1So there you have it, we figured out our lambda. 1So the general equation for how much carbon-14 we can 1expect at any moment in time, t, where t is in years, is N 1of t is equal to the amount of carbon we start off with, 1times e to the minus lambda. 1The minus lambda is 1.21 times 10 to the minus 14, times t in years. 1So now if you say after 1/2 a year, you just plug it in and, 1you have to tell me how much you started off with, and then 1I can tell you how much you have after 1/2 a year, or 1after a billion years, or after a gazillion years. 1And we'll do a lot more of these 1problems in the next video.",science_in-in-class-12th-physics-india_nuclei
"  In this video, I'm going to talk about the somatosensory tracts. Somatosensory, which are the senses of the body, and tracts, which are collections of axons travelling together through the central nervous system. The different types of somatosensory information tend to travel in different pathways, as they move through the central nervous system. In general, the different types of somatosensation break down into two big categories. The first includes position sense, vibration sense, and fine touch sense, or very precise touch sense information. The other big grouping of types of somatosensory information that tend to travel together includes the sense of pain, pain sense, temperature sense, and what we can call gross touch sense, or less precise touch sense information. Recall that somatosensory information from most of the body is going to travel back to the central nervous system through nerves in the peripheral nervous system, and then spinal nerves that'll enter the spinal cord. For example, in this category, let's say we have a receptor that carries some position sense information. Let me just draw an R here in the arm, for receptor for position sense. That information is going to travel in nerves of the peripheral nervous system and then spinal nerves to enter the spinal cord and deliver that information into the spinal cord. The same thing with this other big category of types of somatosensation. Let's say we had some sort of receptor here down in the leg, I'll just write an R for receptor that can detect noxious stimuli, that can cause the experience of pain. Then that information can travel through nerves of the peripheral nervous system and then spinal nerves to enter the spinal cord and deliver that information into the central nervous system. The same is true for somatosensory information from the face and other parts of the head, but that information will enter usually the brain stem through cranial nerves, instead of entering the spinal cord through spinal nerves. For instance if we have a receptor that can detect vibration somewhere here on the face, that information can travel through a cranial nerve into the brain stem. If we had another receptor here in the face that could detect say temperature, one of these other types of somatosensation, that also could travel through a cranial nerve and enter the brain stem. But now what happens once this information is delivered, into either the spinal cord or into the brain stem- So I've taken the brain and the spinal cord, and I've drawn a little bigger illustration over here. We're still looking at it from the front, but I've kind of cut into the brain here, so we're seeing inside of the brain, and the inside of the spinal cord. First lets consider this category of different types of somatosensation, the category that includes pain sense and temperature sense and gross touch sense. Let's say, like I've drawn here, we have some of that coming in from the leg on one side. Let me just draw an arrow, showing that information entering the spinal cord down low here. Inside the spinal cord, neuron axons are going to carry that information up to the brain, in one of these somatosensory tracts, one of the tracts that's specific to this category of types of somatosensation. Let me just draw that, but I'm going to leave out some of the details. One important detail is that it actually crosses to the other side, and then goes up through the spinal cord, and up through the brain stem, and then comes to a place kind of deep down in the cerebrum, what we'll talk about a little bit more in another one of these videos. Notice that it's on the other side, it's actually coming into the cerebral hemisphere on the other side, from the part of the body that the receptor was on. The same is going to be true, for this other category of types of somatosensation, that includes position and vibration and fine touch sense. Let's say, just like I drew some of that information coming in from an arm on this side, let me just draw an arrow here, showing that that's also coming in the spinal cord, but a little higher up on the spinal cord. Now there'll be a different tract, that's going to carry that information up, and it's going to cross in a little different place, a little higher up in the brain stem, and then it's also going to keep going up, and then it's going to come to the same place deep down in one of the cerebral hemispheres, on the other side from where that information came in from the body. The pain, temperature, and gross touch sense from the face, and some other parts of the head, can come into the brain stem through cranial nerves, and then that information is actually going to take a funny pathway that actually goes down first, and then crosses, and then goes up to about the same place, or pretty near the place, that this information from the rest of the body came from. Lastly, position sense, vibration sense, and fine touch sense from the face and some other parts of the head, will also come into the brain stem through cranial nerves, and it will also cross over to the other side, and go to about the same place deep in the cerebral hemisphere. In this place, deep in the cerebral hemisphere, all these different types of somatosensory information are going to come back together. There going to be very close to each other now, and then they're going to stay together pretty close as they send that information on to areas of the cerebral cortex, areas on the outside of the cerebral hemisphere, that will do more processing of that information. Becuase the somatosensory tracts carrying these types of sensory information through the central nervous system have this sort of anatomy, this sort of structure, one of the big consequences of this is that if there's some sort of injury to one of the cerebral hemispheres- Let me just draw a big orange arrow through this cerebral hemisphere, to indicate that there's an injury or some kind of disease has affected this side of the brain- Then what we often see, with an injury to one side of the brain, is the other side of the body can have somatosensory loss, because all of these pathways carrying somatosensory information crossed from one side over to the other side. If we're looking from the front and this is the left cerebral hemisphere that has an injury, we could see loss of somatosensation, or abnormal somatosensation on the right side of the face and the rest of the body, depending on how much brain tissue is injured, and and how much of these somatosensory pathways are affected. I think you could also see, that since all these different pathways have slightly different parts of the central nervous system that they travel to, abnormalities in some different parts of the brain stem or the spinal cord could affect some parts of somatosensation but not others, depending on where the area of abnormality is. We'll save a lot of the details of the exact anatomy and the places these cross for other videos, but I just wanted to introduce this idea of these somatosensory tracts, and why we often see injury to one side of the brain causing somatosensory loss or abnormalities on the other side of the body.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" -  Let's say that we have the fraction 9/10, and I want to add to that the fraction 1/6. What is this, what is this going to equal? So when you first look at this, you say, ""Oh, I have different denominators here. It's not obvious how I add these."" And you'd be right and the way to actually move forward is to find a common denominator, to convert both of these fractions into fractions that have a common denominator. So how do you think about a common denominator? Well, a common denominator's gonna have to be a common multiple of these two denominators of 10 and six. So what's a common multiple of 10 and six? And it's usually simplest to find the least common multiple, and a good way of doing that is start with the larger denominator here, 10, and say, okay is 10 divisible by six? No. Okay, now, is 20 divisible by six? No. Is 30 divisible by six? Yes. 30 is divisible by six. So I'm just going through the multiples of 10 and saying, ""Well what is the smallest multiple of 10 that is divisible by six?"" And that's going to be 30. So I could rewrite both of these fractions as something over 30. So nine over 10. How would I write that as something over 30? Well I multiply the denominator, I'm multiplying the denominator by three. So I've just multiplied the denominator by three. So if I don't want to change the value of the fraction, I have to do the same thing to the numerator. I have to multiply that by three as well because now I'm just multiplying the numerator by three and the denominator by three, and that doesn't change the value of the fraction. So nine times three is 27. So once again, 9/10 and 27/30 represent the same number. I've just written it now with a denominator of 30, and that's useful because I can also write 1/6 with a denominator of 30. Let's do that. So 1/6 is what over 30? I encourage you to pause the video and try to think about it. So what did we do go from six to 30? We had to multiply by five. So if we multiply the denominator by five, we have to multiply the numerator by five as well, so one times five, one times five is five. So 9/10 is the same thing as 27/30, and 1/6 is the same thing as 5/30. And now we can add, now we can add and it's fairly straightforward. We have a certain number of 30ths, added to another number of 30ths, so 27/30 + 5/30, well that's going to be 27, that's going to be 27 plus five, plus five, plus 5/30, plus 5/30, which of course going to be equal to 32/30. 32 over 30, and if we want, we could try to reduce this fraction. We have a common factor of 32 and 30, they're both divisible by two. So if we divide the numerator and the denominator by two, numerator divided by two is 16, denominator divided by two is 15. So, this is the same thing as 16/15, and if I wanted to write this as a mixed number, 15 goes into 16 one time with a remainder one. So this is the same thing as 1 1/15. Let's do another example. Let's say that we wanted to add, we wanted to add 1/2 to to 11/12, to 11 over 12. And I encourage you to pause the video and see if you could work this out. Well like we saw before, we wanna find a common denominator. If these had the same denominator, we could just add them immediately, but we wanna find a common denominator because right now they're not the same. Well what we wanna find is a multiple, a common multiple of two and 12, and ideally we'll find the lowest common multiple of two and 12, and just like we did before, let's start with the larger of the two numbers, 12. Now we could just say well 12 times one is 12, so that we could view that as the lowest multiple of 12. And is that divisible by two? Yeah, sure. 12 is divisible by two. So 12 is actually the least common multiple of two and 12, so we could write both of these fractions as something over 12. So 1/2 is what over 12? Well to go from two to 12, you multiply by six, so we'll also multiply the numerator by six. Now we see 1/2, and 6/12, these are the same thing. One is half of two, six is half of 12. And how would we write 11/12 as something over 12? Well it's already written as something over 12, 11/12 already has 12 in the denominator, so we don't have to change that. 11/12, and now we're ready to add. So this is going to be equal to six, this is going to be equal to six plus 11, six plus 11 over 12. Over 12. We have 6/12 plus 11/12, it's gonna be six plus 11 over 12, which is equal to, six plus 11 is 17/12. If we wanted to write it as a mixed number, that is what, 12 goes into 17 one time with a remainder of five, so 1 5/12. Let's do one more of these. This is strangely fun. Alright. Let's say that we wanted to add, We're gonna add 3/4 to, we're gonna add 3/4 to 1/5. To one over five. What is this going to be? And once again, pause the video and see if you could work it out. Well we have different denominators here, and we wanna find, we wanna rewrite these so they have the same denominators, so we have to find a common multiple, ideally the least common multiple. So what's the least common multiple of four and five? Well let's start with the larger number, and let's look at its multiples and keep increasing them until we get one that's divisible by four. So five is not divisible by four. 10 is not divisible by four, or perfectly divisible by four is what we care about. 15 is not perfectly divisible by four. 20 is divisible by four, in fact, that is five times four. That is 20. So what we could do is, we could write both of these fractions as having 20 in the denominator, or 20 as the denominator. So we could write 3/4 is something over 20. So to go from four to 20 in the denominator, we multiplied by five. So we also do that to the numerator. We multiply by three times five to get 15. All I did to go from four to 20, multiplied by five. So I have to do the same thing to the numerator, three times five is 15. 3/4 is the same thing as 15/20, and over here. 1/5. What is that over 20? Well to go from five to 20, you have to multiply by four. So we have to do the same thing to the numerator. I have to multiply this numerator times four to get 4/20. So now I've rewritten this instead of 3/4 plus 1/5, it's now written as 15/20 plus 4/20. And what is that going to be? Well that's going to be 15 plus four is 19/20. 19/20, and we're done.",math_cc-fifth-grade-math_imp-fractions-3
" In this video, I want to introduce you to the idea of an exponential function and really just show you how fast these things can grow. So let's just write an example exponential function here. So let's say we have y is equal to 3 to the x power. Notice, this isn't x to the third power, this is 3 to the x power. Our independent variable x is the actual exponent. So let's make a table here to see how quickly this thing grows, and maybe we'll graph it as well. So let's take some x values here. Let's start with x is equal to negative 4. Then we'll go to negative 3, negative 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. And let's figure out what our y-values are going to be for each of these x-values. Now, here, y is going to be 3 to the negative 4 power, which is equal to 1 over 3 to the fourth power. 3 to the third is 27 times 3 again is 81. So this is equal to 1/81. When x is equal to negative 3, y is 3. We'll do this in a different color. This color is hard to read. y is 3 to the negative 3 power. Well, that's 1 over 3 to the third power, which is equal to 1/27. So we're going from a super-small number to a less super-small number. And then 3 to the negative 2 power is going to be 1/9, right? 1 over 3 squared, and then we have 3 to the 0 power, which is just equal to 1. So we're getting a little bit larger, a little bit larger, but you'll see that we are about to explode. Now, we have 3 to the first power. That's equal to 3. So we have 3 to the second power, right? y is equal to 3 to the second power. That's 9. 3 to the third power, 27. 3 to the fourth power, 81. If we were to put the fifth power, 243. Let's graph this, just to get an idea of how quickly we're exploding. Let me draw my axes here. So that's my x-axis and that is my y-axis. And let me just do it in increments of 5, because I really want to get the general shape of the graph here. So let me just draw as straight a line as I can. Let's say this is 5, 10, 15. Actually, I won't get to 81 that way. I want to get to 81. Well, that's good enough. Let me draw it a little bit differently than I've drawn it. So let me draw it down here because all of these values, you might notice, are positive values because I have a positive base. So let me draw it like this. Good enough. And then let's say I have 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80. That is 80 right there. That's 10. That's 30. That'll be good for approximation. And then let's say that this is negative 5. This is positive 5 right here. And actually, let me stretch it out a little bit more. Let's say this is negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4. Then we have 1, 2, 3, and 4. So when x is equal to 0, we're equal to 1, right? When x is equal to 0, y is equal to 1, which is right around there. When x is equal to 1, y is equal to 3, which is right around there. When x is equal to 2, y is equal to 9, which is right around there. When x equal to 3, y is equal to 27, which is right around there. When x is equal to 4, y is equal to 81. You see very quickly this is just exploding. If I did 5, we'd go to 243, which wouldn't even fit on my screen. When you go to negative 1, we get smaller and smaller. So at negative 1, we're at 1/9. Eventually, you're not even going to see this. It's going to get closer and closer to zero. As this approaches larger and larger negative numbers, or I guess I should say smaller negative numbers, so 3 to the negative thousand, 3 to the negative million, we're getting numbers closer and closer to zero without actually ever approaching zero. So as we go from negative infinity, x is equal to negative infinity, we're getting very close to zero, we're slowly getting our way ourselves away from zero, but then bam! Once we start getting into the positive numbers, we just explode. We just explode, and we keep exploding at an ever-increasing rate. So the idea here is just to show you that exponential functions are really, really dramatic. Well, you can always construct a faster expanding function. For example, you could say y is equal to x to the x, even faster expanding, but out of the ones that we deal with in everyday life, this is one of the fastest. So given that, let's do some word problems that just give us an appreciation for exponential functions. So let's say that someone sends out a chain letter in week 1. In week 1, someone sent a chain letter to 10 people. And the chain letter says you have to now send this chain letter to 10 more new people, and if you don't, you're going to have bad luck, and your hair is going to fall out, and you'll marry a frog, or whatever else. So all of these people agree and they go and each send it to 10 people the next week. So in week 2, they go out and each send it to 10 more people. So each of those original 10 people are each sending out 10 more of the letters. So now 100 people have the letters, right? Each of those 10 sent out 10, so that 100 letters were sent out. 10 were sent. Here, 100 were sent. In week 3, what's going to happen? Each of those 100 people who got this one, they're each going to send out 10, assuming that everyone is really into chain letters. So 1,000 people are going to get it. And so the general pattern here is, the people who receive it, so in week n where n is the week we're talking about, how many people received the letter? In week n, we have 10 to the nth people receive-- i before e except after c-- the letter. So if I were to ask you, how many people are getting the letter on the sixth week? How many people are actually going to receive that letter? Well, what's 10 to the sixth power? 10 to the sixth is equal to 1 with six zeroes, which is 1 million people are going to receive that letter in just 6 weeks, just sending out 10 letters each. And obviously, in the real world, most people chuck these in the basket, so you don't have this good of a hit rate. But if you did, if every 10 people you sent it to also sent it to 10 people and so on and so forth, by the sixth week, you would have a million people. And by the ninth week, you would have a billion people. And frankly, the week after that, you would run out of people. I'll see you in the next video.",math_math1_exp-func
" In the last video, I introduced you to the notion of-- well, really we started with the random variable. And then we moved on to the two types of random variables. You had discrete, that took on a finite number of values. And the these, I was going to say that they tend to be integers, but they don't always have to be integers. You have discrete, so finite meaning you can't have an infinite number of values for a discrete random variable. And then we have the continuous, which can take on an infinite number. And the example I gave for continuous is, let's say random variable x. And people do tend to use-- let me change it a little bit, just so you can see it can be something other than an x. Let's have the random variable capital Y. They do tend to be capital letters. Is equal to the exact amount of rain tomorrow. And I say rain because I'm in northern California. It's actually raining quite hard right now. We're short right now, so that's a positive. We've been having a drought, so that's a good thing. But the exact amount of rain tomorrow. And let's say I don't know what the actual probability distribution function for this is, but I'll draw one and then we'll interpret it. Just so you can kind of think about how you can think about continuous random variables. So let me draw a probability distribution, or they call it its probability density function. And we draw like this. And let's say that there is-- it looks something like this. Like that. All right, and then I don't know what this height is. So the x-axis here is the amount of rain. Where this is 0 inches, this is 1 inch, this is 2 inches, this is 3 inches, 4 inches. And then this is some height. Let's say it peaks out here at, I don't know, let's say this 0.5. So the way to think about it, if you were to look at this and I were to ask you, what is the probability that Y-- because that's our random variable-- that Y is exactly equal to 2 inches? That Y is exactly equal to two inches. What's the probability of that happening? Well, based on how we thought about the probability distribution functions for the discrete random variable, you'd say OK, let's see. 2 inches, that's the case we care about right now. Let me go up here. You'd say it looks like it's about 0.5. And you'd say, I don't know, is it a 0.5 chance? And I would say no, it is not a 0.5 chance. And before we even think about how we would interpret it visually, let's just think about it logically. What is the probability that tomorrow we have exactly 2 inches of rain? Not 2.01 inches of rain, not 1.99 inches of rain. Not 1.99999 inches of rain, not 2.000001 inches of rain. Exactly 2 inches of rain. I mean, there's not a single extra atom, water molecule above the 2 inch mark. And not as single water molecule below the 2 inch mark. It's essentially 0, right? It might not be obvious to you, because you've probably heard, oh, we had 2 inches of rain last night. But think about it, exactly 2 inches, right? Normally if it's 2.01 people will say that's 2. But we're saying no, this does not count. It can't be 2 inches. We want exactly 2. 1.99 does not count. Normally our measurements, we don't even have tools that can tell us whether it is exactly 2 inches. No ruler you can even say is exactly 2 inches long. At some point, just the way we manufacture things, there's going to be an extra atom on it here or there. So the odds of actually anything being exactly a certain measurement to the exact infinite decimal point is actually 0. The way you would think about a continuous random variable, you could say what is the probability that Y is almost 2? So if we said that the absolute value of Y minus is 2 is less than some tolerance? Is less than 0.1. And if that doesn't make sense to you, this is essentially just saying what is the probability that Y is greater than 1.9 and less than 2.1? These two statements are equivalent. I'll let you think about it a little bit. But now this starts to make a little bit of sense. Now we have an interval here. So we want all Y's between 1.9 and 2.1. So we are now talking about this whole area. And area is key. So if you want to know the probability of this occurring, you actually want the area under this curve from this point to this point. And for those of you who have studied your calculus, that would essentially be the definite integral of this probability density function from this point to this point. So from-- let me see, I've run out of space down here. So let's say if this graph-- let me draw it in a different color. If this line was defined by, I'll call it f of x. I could call it p of x or something. The probability of this happening would be equal to the integral, for those of you who've studied calculus, from 1.9 to 2.1 of f of x dx. Assuming this is the x-axis. So it's a very important thing to realize. Because when a random variable can take on an infinite number of values, or it can take on any value between an interval, to get an exact value, to get exactly 1.999, the probability is actually 0. It's like asking you what is the area under a curve on just this line. Or even more specifically, it's like asking you what's the area of a line? An area of a line, if you were to just draw a line, you'd say well, area is height times base. Well the height has some dimension, but the base, what's the width the a line? As far as the way we've defined a line, a line has no with, and therefore no area. And it should make intuitive sense. That the probability of a very super-exact thing happening is pretty much 0. That you really have to say, OK what's the probably that we'll get close to 2? And then you can define an area. And if you said oh, what's the probability that we get someplace between 1 and 3 inches of rain, then of course the probability is much higher. The probability is much higher. It would be all of this kind of stuff. You could also say what's the probability we have less than 0.1 of rain? Then you would go here and if this was 0.1, you would calculate this area. And you could say what's the probability that we have more than 4 inches of rain tomorrow? Then you would start here and you'd calculate the area in the curve all the way to infinity, if the curve has area all the way to infinity. And hopefully that's not an infinite number, right? Then your probability won't make any sense. But hopefully if you take this sum it comes to some number. And we'll say there's only a 10% chance that you have more than 4 inches tomorrow. And all of this should immediately lead to one light bulb in your head, is that the probability of all of the events that might occur can't be more than 100%. Right? All the events combined-- there's a probability of 1 that one of these events will occur. So essentially, the whole area under this curve has to be equal to 1. So if we took the integral of f of x from 0 to infinity, this thing, at least as I've drawn it, dx should be equal to 1. For those of you who've studied calculus. For those of you who haven't, an integral is just the area under a curve. And you can watch the calculus videos if you want to learn a little bit more about how to do them. And this also applies to the discrete probability distributions. Let me draw one. The sum of all of the probabilities have to be equal to 1. And that example with the dice-- or let's say, since it's faster to draw, the coin-- the two probabilities have to be equal to 1. So this is 1, 0, where x is equal to 1 if we're heads or 0 if we're tails. Each of these have to be 0.5. Or they don't have to be 0.5, but if one was 0.6, the other would have to be 0.4. They have to add to 1. If one of these was-- you can't have a 60% probability of getting a heads and then a 60% probability of getting a tails as well. Because then you would have essentially 120% probability of either of the outcomes happening, which makes no sense at all. So it's important to realize that a probability distribution function, in this case for a discrete random variable, they all have to add up to 1. So 0.5 plus 0.5. And in this case the area under the probability density function also has to be equal to 1. Anyway, I'm all the time for now. In the next video I'll introduce you to the idea of an expected value. See you soon.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-probability-of-events
" -  We're told the graph of y equals two to the x is shown below, alright. Which of the following is the graph of y equals two to the negative x minus five? So there's two changes here. Instead of two to the x, we have two to the negative x and then, we're not leaving that alone, we, then, subtract five. So let's take 'em step by step. So let's first think about what y equals two to the negative x would look like. Well, any input we now put into an x, we're now going to take the negative of. So if I input a two, it's like taking the opposite of the two and then, inputting that into two to the x. And so, what we're essentially going to do is flip this graph over the y-axis. So, here we have the point two comma four. Over here, we're going to have the point negative two comma four. When x is zero, they're going to give us the same value. So they're both going to have the same y-intercept. And so are graph is going to look like, our graph is going to look something like, this. They're going to be mirror images flipped around the y-axis. So, it's going to look like that. That is the graph of y is equal to two to the negative x. And then we have to worry about the subtracting five from it. Well, that's, you're subtracting five from your final y-value so that's going to work. You're subtracting five to get your y-value now, where your y-value is going to be five lower, is I guess the best way to say it, so this is going to shift the graph down by five. So instead of having the y-intercept there, it's going to be five lower. One, two, one, each hash mark is two so this is one, two, three, four, five, is going to be right over there. So shift down by five, two, four, five. It's going to look like that. And the asymptote, instead of the asymptote, going towards y equals zero, the asymptote is going to be at y is equal to negative five. So the asymptote is going to be y equals negative five. So it should look something like, something like what I am drawing right now. Something like, something like that. So now we can look at which choices. So this should be the graph of y equals two to the negative x minus five. So let's see which of these choices depict that. So this first choice actually seems to be spot-on. It's exactly what we drew. Well, we can look at the other ones, just in case. Well, this is, this looks like, what did they do over here? Looks like they, instead of flipping over the y-axis, they took the, they flipped over the x-axis and then they shifted down, so that's not right. Here it looks like they got what we got but they flipped it over the x-axis. And this looks like they flipped it over the y-axis but then they shifted, instead of shifting down by five, it looks like they shifted to the left by five. So we should feel pretty good especially 'cause we essentially drew this before even looking at the choice.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-3
"  In this video, we're going to look at the SP three hybridization present in methane and ethane; let's start with methane. So that's CH four, if I want to draw a dot structure for methane, I would start with carbon, and its four valence electrons, and then we would put hydrogen around that; each hydrogen has one valence electron, so we go ahead and draw in our hydrogens with one valence electron, and that gives us the Lewis Dot structure. Usually you see it drawn like this, with carbon with its four bonds to hydrogen around it, like that, and in methane, all of these bonds are equivalent, in terms of things like bond length and energy. And so the four valence electrons that carbon brought to the table over here, let me go ahead and highlight those four valence electrons, those should be equivalent, and if we look at the electron configuration for carbon, let's go ahead and do that right now. It's one S two, so go ahead and put in two electrons in the one S orbital, two S two, go ahead and put in two electrons in the two S orbital, and then two P two, and so, I'm assuming you already know your electron configuration, so it would look something like that. If we look at those four valence electrons on our orbital notation here, that would be these four electrons here, the valence electrons in the outer shell. And if we look at this, this implies that carbon would only form two bonds, because I have these unpaired electrons right here, and everything's of different energies, and so, what we see from the dot structure and experimentally, doesn't quite match up with the electron configuration here, and so to explain this difference, Linus Pauling came up with the idea of hybridization. And so, the first thing that he said was, you could go ahead and take out one of these electrons in the two S, and promote it up to the P orbital here, so let me go ahead and show that, so we've moved one of those electrons up to the two P orbital, so we're in the excited state now. And now we have the opportunity for carbon to form four bonds, however, those electrons are not of equivalent energy, and so Linus Pauling said, ""Let's do something else here: ""Let's go ahead and promote the two S orbital,"" so we're gonna take this S orbital, and we're gonna promote it in energy, and we're going to take these P orbitals and demote them in energy, so we're gonna lower those P orbitals, like that, so we have our P orbitals here. And these had one electron in each of them, but we're gonna hybridize them, so this is no longer going to be an S orbital; it's going to be an SP three hybrid orbital; this is no longer going to be a P orbital; it's going to be a SP three hybrid orbital, and same with these. So the idea is, you're taking some of the S character, and some of the P character, and you're hybridizing them together into brand new orbitals, and since you're taking this from one S orbital and three P orbitals, we're doing this using one S orbital and three P orbitals, we call this SP three hybridization, so this is SP three hybridization: We create four new, hybrid orbitals. And now we have what we're looking for, because now we have four unpaired electrons, so carbon can form four bonds now, and they're equal in energy, so that's the idea of hybridization. All right, let's think about the character, or the shape of this new hybrid orbital. Well, we know that an S orbital is shaped like a sphere, so we're taking one of those S orbitals here, so one S orbital, and we know that a P orbital is shaped like a dumbbell, so we're taking three of these P orbitals here. So one of these S orbital, and three of these P orbitals, and we're going to hybridize them together, and when that happens, in turns out the shape of the new hybrid orbital you get, has this large frontal lobe here, like this, and then a smaller back lobe, back here like this; so we're gonna make four of these. All right, so once again we have four SP three hybrid orbitals, and each one of these hybrid orbitals is gonna have an electron in it, so we can see that each one of these SP three hybrid orbitals has one electron in there, like that, and so the final orbital, the final hybrid orbitals here contain 25 percent S character. Let me go ahead and write this down here: So 25 percent S character, and 75 percent P character, in this new hybrid orbital. Once again, that's because we started out with one S orbital and three P orbitals for our hybridization. All right, let's go back to methane, and let's go ahead and draw in a picture, because now we know that this carbon is SP three hybridized, so let's go ahead and draw a picture of that hybridized carbon, here. So we're gonna go ahead and draw in our carbon, and we know that it has four SP three hybrid orbitals, and once again, when we draw the orbitals, we're gonna ignore the smaller back lobe here, so it doesn't confuse us. So we go ahead and draw in, here's one of our orbitals, for carbon, so that's an SP three hybrid orbital. Here's another SP three hybrid orbital, here's another one, and then, finally, a fourth one. So let's go back up here, to this picture, 'cause once again, we need to show that each of these hybrid orbitals has one valence electron in it, so I can go ahead and put in my one valence electron, in each of my hybrid orbitals, like that, so here's our valence electron. If we're talking about methane, so carbon is bonded to four hydrogens, each hydrogen has an un-hybridized S orbital, and each hydrogen has one electron in that, so I'm gonna go ahead and sketch that in; let's go ahead and use blue here. So here's an un-hybridized S orbital, I'm gonna go ahead and draw these in, so an un-hybridized S orbital; each one of these un-hybridized S orbitals for hydrogen has one valence electron, so I'm gonna go ahead and put in those one valence electrons, in here, like that, so same for here, and then, finally, for here. So this is just one picture of the methane molecule, so this is hydrogen, these are all the hydrogens right here, like that. All right, let's think about this bond that we formed right here, so here we have an overlap of orbitals, an overlap of an SP three hybrid orbital form carbon, with a un-hybridized S orbital from hydrogen here, and so this is a head-on overlap, so we're sharing electrons here, in this head-on overlap. And a head-on overlap, in chemistry, is called a sigma bond, so this is a sigma bond, sigma bond here, a head-on overlap, and this happens three more times in the methane molecule. So here's a head-on overlap, here's a head-on overlap, and here's a head-on overlap. And so we have a total of four sigma bonds in the methane molecule, so a single-bond here, instead of saying a single-bond now, we're saying it's also can be called, ""a sigma bond,"" and so this head-on overlap. Let's look at the ethane molecule now, so for ethane, we'll go ahead an draw that in, so ethane would be C two H six, so we have two carbons; let's go ahead and draw in those two carbons, and then six hydrogens, so we put in our six hydrogens around there, like that. All right, when we're thinking about hybridization, we've just seen, with methane, that a carbon atom with four single-bonds will be SP three hybridized. So I go back up to here, this carbon right here, four single-bonds; it's SP three hybridized, we could use that same logic and apply it to ethane, here. Each of the carbons in ethane has four single-bonds, so each carbon in ethane is SP three hybridized, so let me go ahead and put SP three hybridized here, so let's go ahead, and draw the picture with the orbitals. So let's get some more room. If each carbon is SP three hybridized, that means each carbon is gonna have four SP three hybrid orbitals. So I can go ahead and sketch in one carbon, once again, I'm ignoring the back lobe, one carbon with four SP three hybrid orbitals, and we know the other carbon is also SP three hybridized, so I can sketch in four SP three hybrid orbitals for this one too, so here's my four SP three hybrid orbitals for this carbon. All right, in terms of electrons, let's go ahead and put in our electrons here. So, let's see, there's one electron in this orbital, one electron in this orbital, one electron in this orbital, one electron from this carbon. And then, for this other carbon, so there's one electron in this orbital, one electron in this orbital, one electron in this orbital, and one electron in this orbital. And then we can go ahead and put in our hydrogens, so we know each hydrogen has an un-hybridized S orbital, with one valence electron, so I can go ahead and do that. And I'll draw in the rest of our hydrogens, so that's four hydrogens, five hydrogens, and then six hydrogens, like that. All right, we just said that a sigma bond is a head-on overlap of orbitals. So, here we have a head-on overlap of orbitals, the bond between the two carbons, and then, of course, all of these are too. So when we count all of those up, that's four, five, six, and seven; so there are seven sigma bonds in the ethane molecule, so seven sigma bonds here. And we could go up here to this dot structure, and look at them again, so here's one, two, three, four, five, six, and then seven: Seven sigma bonds. Let's focus in on the bond between the two carbons now, so this sigma bond, right in here, so that's a sigma bond, and there's free rotation about this sigma bond, so if you could imageine rotating around this bond, so these carbons can rotate in space, and that's gonna give different conformations, so you could have different confirmations of the ethane molecule, which is in later videos. 1So you have free rotation about sigma bonds. 1Let me go ahead and write that, 1'cause that's pretty important, 1so free rotation about sigma bonds. 1And then, the last thing I wanted to point out, 1about the ethane molecule here, is the bond length: 1So the length between this carbon and this carbon, 1so this bond length, in here, turns out to be 1approximately one point five four angstroms, 1so you'll see slightly different values 1in different textbooks, but we'll say 1it's approximately this value, and the reason 1we wanna know that, is we're gonna compare 1this carbon-carbon bond length to the bond length 1in some other molecules, in some later videos.",science_chemistry_chemical-bonds
" We're asked to complete the square to solve 4x squared plus 40x minus 300 is equal to 0. So let me just rewrite it. So 4x squared plus 40x minus 300 is equal to 0. So just as a first step here, I don't like having this 4 out front as a coefficient on the x squared term. I'd prefer if that was a 1. So let's just divide both sides of this equation by 4. So let's just divide everything by 4. So this divided by 4, this divided by 4, that divided by 4, and the 0 divided by 4. Just dividing both sides by 4. So this will simplify to x squared plus 10x. And I can obviously do that, because as long as whatever I do to the left hand side, I also do the right hand side, that will make the equality continue to be valid. So that's why I can do that. So 40 divided by 4 is 10x. And then 300 divided by 4 is what? That is 75. Let me verify that. 4 goes into 30 seven times. 7 times 4 is 28. You subtract, you get a remainder of 2. Bring down the 0. 4 goes into 20 five times. 5 times 4 is 20. Subtract zero. So it goes 75 times. This is minus 75 is equal to 0. And right when you look at this, just the way it's written, you might try to factor this in some way. But it's pretty clear this is not a complete square, or this is not a perfect square trinomial. Because if you look at this term right here, this 10, half of this 10 is 5. And 5 squared is not 75. So this is not a perfect square. So what we want to do is somehow turn whatever we have on the left hand side into a perfect square. And I'm going to start out by kind of getting this 75 out of the way. You'll sometimes see it where people leave the 75 on the left hand side. I'm going to put on the right hand side just so it kind of clears things up a little bit. So let's add 75 to both sides to get rid of the 75 from the left hand side of the equation. And so we get x squared plus 10x, and then negative 75 plus 75. Those guys cancel out. And I'm going to leave some space here, because we're going to add something here to complete the square that is equal to 75. So all I did is add 75 to both sides of this equation. Now, in this step, this is really the meat of completing the square. I want to add something to both sides of this equation. I can't add to only one side of the equation. So I want to add something to both sides of this equation so that this left hand side becomes a perfect square. And the way we can do that, and saw this in the last video where we constructed a perfect square trinomial, is that this last term-- or I should say, what we see on the left hand side, not the last term, this expression on the left hand side, it will be a perfect square if we have a constant term that is the square of half of the coefficient on the first degree term. So the coefficient here is 10. Half of 10 is 5. 5 squared is 25. So I'm going to add 25 to the left hand side. And of course, in order to maintain the equality, anything I do the left hand side, I also have to do to the right hand side. And now we see that this is a perfect square. We say, hey, what two numbers if I add them I get 10 and when I multiply them I get 25? Well, that's 5 and 5. So when we factor this, what we see on the left hand side simplifies to, this is x plus 5 squared. x plus 5 times x plus 5. And you can look at the videos on factoring if you find that confusing. Or you could look at the last video on constructing perfect square trinomials. I encourage you to square this and see that you get exactly this. And this will be equal to 75 plus 25, which is equal to 100. And so now we're saying that something squared is equal to 100. So really, this is something right over here-- if I say something squared is equal to 100, that means that that something is one of the square roots of 100. And we know that 100 has two square roots. It has positive 10 and it has negative 10. So we could say that x plus 5, the something that we were squaring, that must be one of the square roots of 100. So that must be equal to the plus or minus square root of 100, or plus or minus 10. Or we could separate it out. We could say that x plus 5 is equal to 10, or x plus 5 is equal to negative 10. On this side right here, I can just subtract 5 from both sides of this equation and I would get-- I'll just write it out. Subtracting 5 from both sides, I get x is equal to 5. And over here, I could subtract 5 from both sides again-- I subtracted 5 in both cases-- subtract 5 again and I can get x is equal to negative 15. So those are my two solutions that I got to solve this equation. We can verify that they actually work, and I'll do that in blue. So let's try with 5. I'll just do one of them. I'll leave the other one for you. I'll leave the other one for you to verify that it works. So 4 times x squared. So 4 times 25 plus 40 times 5 minus 300 needs to be equal to 0. 4 times 25 is 100. 40 times 5 is 200. We're going to subtract that 300. 100 plus 200 minus 300, that definitely equals 0. So x equals 5 worked. And I think you'll find that x equals negative 15 will also work when you substitute it into this right over here.",math_algebra-home_alg-quadratics
" We're told, solve the absolute value of 3x minus 9 is equal to 0, and graph the solution on a number line. So let's just rewrite the absolute value equation. They told us that the absolute value of 3x minus 9 is equal to 0. So we're told that the absolute value of the something-- in this case the something is 3x minus 9-- is equal to 0. If I told you that the absolute value of something is equal to 0, I'm telling you that something has to be exactly 0 away from 0, or 0 away from the origin on the number line. So the only thing that that something could be is 0. If I told you that the absolute value of x is equal to 0, you know that x has to be equal to 0. That's the only value whose absolute value is 0. So if I told you that the absolute value of 3x minus 9 is 0, than we know that 3x minus 9 has to be equal to 0, and that's kind of unique about the 0 is that, it's the only number the has a unique, that's only the absolute value of 0. If you had, say, a 1 here, you could say, oh well, then this thing could be a 1 or a negative 1. But here, if you have a 0, this thing can only be 0. So solving this equation is fairly straightforward. If we want to isolate the 3x, get rid of the negative 9 on the left-hand side, we add 9 to both sides of the equation. Add 9 to both sides of the equation, these 9's cancel out. That's the whole point. On the left-hand side, you're just left with 3x, and on the right-hand side, you are just left with 9. Now we want to solve for x, so we have 3 times x. Let's divide it by 3, because 3 times x divided by 3 is just going to be x. But if we divide the left side by 3, we have to divide the right side by 3. So we are left with-- these guys cancel out. x is equal to 9 over 3, which is 3. And that's our solution. Now let's try out. Let's make sure that this actually works. Let's substitute it back into our original equation. So we have the absolute value of 3 times x. Instead of x, I'll just put in our actual answer that we got, 3 times 3 minus 9 has got to be equal to 0. So what's this going to be equal to? 3 times 3 is 9. So it's the absolute value of 9 minus 9, which is the absolute value of 0, which is, indeed, 0. So it does, indeed, equal 0, and we are done.",math_algebra-home_alg-absolute-value
" In this video we're going to cover what is arguably, the single most important concept in all the statistics. Well if you go into almost any scientific field you might even argue that it's the single most important concept. I've actually told people that it's kind of sad they don't cover this in the core curriculum. Everyone should know about is because it touches on every single aspect of our lives and that's the normal distribution or the Gaussian distribution or the bell curve. And just to kind of give you a preview of what it is, my preview will actually make it seem pretty strange but as we go through this video hopefully you'll get a little bit more intuition of what it's all about. The Gaussian distribution or the normal distribution, they're two words for the same thing. It was actually Gauss who came up with it. I think he was studying astronomical phenomenon when he did. But it's a probability density function just like we studies the Poisson distribution. It's just like that. And just to give you the preview it looks like this. The probability of getting any x, and it's a class of probability distribution functions. Just like the binomial distribution is and the Poisson distribution, it's based on a bunch of parameters. This is how you would traditionally see it written in a lot of textbooks and if we have time, I'd like to rearrange the algebra just to get a little bit more intuition of how it all works out. Or maybe we could get some insights on where it all came from. I'm not going to prove it in this video, that's a little bit beyond our scope. Although, I do want to do it and there's actually some really neat mathematics that might show up. If you're a math lead there's something called Sterling's formula what you might want to do a Wikipedia search on, which is really fascinating. It approximates factorials with essentially a continuous function. But I won't go into that right now. The normal distribution is 1 over -- this is how it's normally written -- the standard deviation times the square root of 2 pi times e to the minus 1/2. Well, I like to write it this way, it easier to remember, times whatever value you're trying to get minus the mean of our distribution divided by the standard deviation of our distribution squared. And so if you think about it, actually this is a good thing to just notice right now. This is how far I'm from the mean and we're dividing that by the standard deviation of whatever our distribution is. This is a preview of actually a normal distribution that I've plotted, the purple line here is a normal distribution. Initially the whole exercise -- I know I jump around a little bit -- is to show you that the normal distribution is a good approximation for the binomial distribution and vice versa. If you take enough trials in your binomal distribution and we'll touch on that a second. The intuition of this term right here I think is interesting because we're saying, how far are we away from the mean, we're dividing by the standard deviation. So this whole term right here is how many standard deviations we are away from the mean. This is actually called the standard z score. One thing I found in statistics is there's a lot of words a lot of definitions and they all sound very fancy, the standard z score. But the underlying concept is pretty straightforward. Let's say I had a probability distribution and I get some x value that's out here and it's 3 and a half the standard deviations is away from the mean, then it's standard z score is 3 and a half. Anyway let's focus on the purpose of this video. So that's what the normal distribution, I guess the probability density function for the normal distribution looks like. But how did it get there? By the end of this video you should at least feel comfortable that this is a good approximation for the binomial distribution if you're taking enough trials. And that's what's fascinating about the normal distribution is that if you have the sum -- and I'll do a whole other video on the central limit theorem -- but if you have the sum of many independent trials approaching infinity, that the distribution of those, even though the distribution of each of those trials might have been non-normal but the distribution of the sum of all those trials approaches the normal distribution. I'll talk more about that later. But that's why it's such a good distribution to kind of assume for a lot of underlying phenomenon. If you're kind of modeling weather patterns or drug interactions and you we'll talk about where it might work well and where it might not work so well. Like sometimes people might assume things like a normal distribution in fice and we've see the ficial crisis that's led to a lot of things blowing up but. Anyway, let's go back to this. This is a spreadsheet right here. I just made a black background and you can downloaded it at khanacademy.org/downloads Actually, if you just do that you'll see all of the downloads. I haven't put it there yet, I'm going to do it right after I record the videos downloads/normal distribution.xls. If you just go up to khanacademy.org/download/ you'll see all the things there and you'll see this spreadsheet. I encourage you to play with it and maybe do other spreadsheets were you experiment with it. So this spreadsheet what we do is we're doing a game or let's say I'm sitting I'm on a street and I flip a coin, I flip a completely fair coin. If I get heads, this is heads, I take a step backwards or let's say a step to the left. And if I get a tails I take a step to the right. So in general I always have a -- this is a completely fair coin -- I have a 50 percent chance of taking a step to the left and I have a 50 percent chance of taking a step to the right. So your intuition there is if I told you I took a you a thousand flips of the coin you're going to keep going left and right. If by chance you get a bunch of heads, you might end up really kind of moving over to the left. If you get a bunch of tails you might move over to the right. And we learned already the odds of getting a bunch of tales or many more tails than heads is a lot lower than things kind of being equal or close to equal. Right here what I've done -- let me scroll down a little bit, I don't want to lose the whole thing -- is I have this little assumption here and I encourage you to fill that out and change it as you like. This is the number of steps I take. This is the mean number of left steps and all I did is I got the probability and we figured out the mean of the binomial distribution. The mean of the binomial distribution is essentially the probability of taking a left step times the total number of trials. So that's equal to 5, that's where that number comes from. And then the variance -- and I'm not sure if I went over this and I need prove this to you if I have and I'll make a whole other video on the variance of the binomial distribution -- is essentially equal to the number of trials, 10 times the probability of taking the left step or kind of a successful trial -- I'm defining left as a successful trial, that could be right as well -- times the probability of 1 minus the successful trial or non successful trial. In this case they're equally probable and that's where I got the 2.5 from. And that's all on the spreadsheet. If you actually click on the cell and look at the actual formula I did that. Although sometimes when you see it in Excel it's a little bit confusing. And this is just the square root of that number. The standard deviation is just the square root of the variance. That's just the square root of 2.5. And so if you look here this says, OK what is the probability that I take 0 steps? So I take a total of 10 steps -- just to understand this spreadsheet -- what is the probability that I take 0 left steps? And just to make clear, if I take 0 left steps that means I must have taken 10 right steps. And I calculate this probability -- I should have drawn maybe a line here -- I calculate this using the binomial distribution. And how do I do that? Let me actually switch colors just to make things interesting. Do they have a purple here? I'll do a blue. So blue for binomial. So what I have here is how many total steps? There's a total of 10 steps. So 10 factorial, that's kind of the number of trials I have. Of that I'm choosing 0 to go left. So 0 factorial divided by 10 minus 0 factorial. This is 10 choose 0. I'm choosing 0 left steps of the total 10 steps I'm taking times the probability of 0 left steps so, it's the probability of a left step, I'm only taking 0 of them times the probability of a right step, and I'm taking 10 of those. So that's where this number came from, this .001. That's what the binomial distribution tells us. And then this one similarly, is 10 factorial over 1 factorial over 10 minus 1 factorial. That's how I get that one. And once again, if you click on the actual cell you'll see that explained. We've done this multiple times. This is just a bionomial calculation. Then right here, after this line right here, you can almost ignore it. 1I did that so that I can do a bunch of different scenarios. 1For example, if I were to go to my spreadsheet, and instead of 1doing 10 I wanted to do 20 steps then everything changes. 1And that's why down here after you get to a certain point the 1whole thing just kind of repeats. 1I'll let you think about why I do that. 1Maybe I should have made a cleaner spreadsheet. 1But it doesn't affect the scatter plot chart that I did. 1And so this plot in blue, and you can't see it because the 1purple is almost right over. 1Actually let me make it smaller so that you can see. 1Let's say I only took 6 steps. 1Well it's still hard to see the difference between the two. 1Once again the whole point of this is to see that the 1normal distribution is a good approximation. 1But they're so close that you can't even see the 1difference on mine. 1If you only took four steps, OK, I think you can see here. 1Let me get my screen draw on. 1The blue curve is right around there. 1This is the binomial. 1There's only a few points here, you the points 1only go up to here. 1This is if I take 0 steps left, 1 step left, 2 steps left, 13 steps left, 4 steps left. 1And then I plot it and then I say what's the probability 1using the binomial distribution? 1And this is my final position right? 1If I take 0 steps to the left then I take 4 steps to the 1right so my final position is at 4, so that's the 1scenario right here. 1Let me switch my color back to yellow, it's easier to see. 1If I take 4 steps to the left, I take 0 steps to the right and 1so my final position is going to be at minus 4. 1It's going to be here. 1If I take an equal amount of both, that's this scenario, 1then I'm neutral. 1I'm just stuck in the middle right here. 1I take 2 steps to the right and then I take 2 steps to the left 1or vice versa, I take 2 steps to the left and then I take 12 steps right and I end up right there. 1Hopefully that makes a little sense. 1My phone is ringing. 1I'll ignore that because the normal distribution 1is so important. 1Actually, my 9 week old son is watching so this is the first 1time I have a live audience. 1He might pick up something about the normal distribution. 1So the blue line right here -- I'll trace it maybe in yellow 1so you can see it -- is the plot of the binomial 1distribution. 1I connected the lines but you see the binomial distribution 1look something more like this. 1This is the probability of getting to minus 4. 1This is the probability of going to minus 2. 1This right here is the probability of 1ending up nowhere. 1Then this is the probability of ending up 2 to the right and 1this is the probability of ending up 4 to the right. 1This is the binomial distribution, I just plotted 1these points right here. 1This is 0.375. 1This is 0.375. 1That's the height of that. 1Now what I wanted to show you is that the normal 1distribution approximates the binomial distribution. 1So this right here, I wanted to say what does the normal 1distribution tell me is the probability of ending up 1with exactly 0 left steps? 1This is a little bit tricky. 1The binomial distribution is a discreet probability 1distribution. 1You can just look at this chart or look here and you say, what 1is the probability of having exactly 1 left step and 3 right 1steps which puts me right here? 1Well you just look at this chart and you say oh, that 1puts me right there. 1I just read that probability, it's actually .25. 1And I say oh, I have a 25 percent chance of ending 1up 2 steps to the right. 1There's a 25 percent chance. 1The normal distribution function is a continuous 1probability distribution so it's a continuous curve. 1It looks like that, it's a bell curve and it goes off 1to infinity and starts approaching 0 on both sides. 1It looks something like that. 1This is a continuous probability distribution. 1You can't just take a point here and say, what's the 1probability that I end up 2 feet to the right? 1Because if you just say that there's the actual the 1probability of being exactly -- and you should watch with my 1video on probability density functions -- but the 1probability of being exactly 2 feet to the right, exactly, I 1mean I'm talking to the atoms, is close to 0. 1You actually have to specify a range around this. 1What I assume in this within a half a foot 1in either direction. 1Right? 1If we're talking about feet. 1To figure that out what I did here is I took the value of 1the probability density function there. 1And I'll show you how I evaluated that. 1And then I multiply that by 1. 1So it gives me this area. 1And I use that as an approximation for this area. 1If you really want to be particular about it what you 1would do is you would take the integral of this curve between 1this point and this point as a better approximation. 1We'll do that in the future. 1But right now I just want to give you the intuition that the 1binomial distribution really does converge to the 1normal distribution. 1So how did I get this number right here? 1Well I said, what is the probability that I think 1 left 1step -- I kind of used less steps as success -- of one? 1And that equaled 1 over the standard deviation. 1When I only took 4 steps the standard deviation was 1. 1So 1 over 1. 1Actually let me change this. 1Let me change it to a higher number. 1We'll go back to the example where I'm at 10. 1So if this is at 10. 1Let me go back to my drawing tool. 1Let me do this calculation. 1Actually, even better let me do this calculation. 1So what's the probability that I have 2 left steps? 1If I have 2 left steps I took a total of 10 steps so I'm going 1to have 8 right steps and that puts me 6 to the right. 1So that's this point right here. 1So what's that probability? 1How do I figure this out using the probability 1density function? 1How do I figure this height? 1Well I say the probability of taking 2 left steps -- that's 1how I calculate it, if you actually click on the cell 1you'll see that -- is equal to 1 over the standard deviation, 11.581 -- and I just directly reference the cell there -- 1times the square root of 2 pi. 1I'm always in awe of the whole notion of e to the i pi is 1equal to negative 1 and all of that. 1But there's another amazing thing. 1That all of a sudden as we take many trials we have this 1formula that has e and pi in it and square roots but once again 1these two numbers just keep showing up. 1It tells you something about the order of the universe 1with a capital o. 1But let's see, times e to the minus 1/2 times x. 1Well x is what we're trying to calculate, two successes. 1To to have exactly 2 left, so it's 2 minus the mean. 1So the mean is five, 2 minus five divided by the standard 1deviation, divided by 1.581, all of that squared. 1That's where this calculation came from. 1So I told you in the last one this right here just tells 1me this value up here. 1If I want to know this exact probability, 1it's the area of this. 1And if I just take one line the are is 0. 1Remember, in this case you can only be 2 feet away because 1we're taking very exact steps. 1But what the normal distribution is it's the 1continuous probability density function so it can tell us 1what's the probability of being 2.183 feet away? 1Which obviously can only happen if we're taking infinitely 1small steps every time. 1But that's what it's use is. 1It happens when you start taking an infinite 1number of steps. 1But it can approximate the discreet. 1And the way I approximate it is I say oh, what's probability of 1being within a foot of that. 1And so I multiply this height, which I 1calculate here, times 1. 1So let's say this has a base of 1, to calculate this area which 1I use as an approximation. 1So you just multiply that times 1 and that's what you get here. 1And I just want to show you. 1Even with just 10 trials, the curves, the normal distribution 1here is in purple and the binomial distribution 1is in blue. 1So they're almost right on top of each other. 1As you can take many more steps they almost converge right on 1top of each other and I encourage you to play 1with the spreadsheets. 1Actually, let me show you that they converge. 1There's a convergence worksheet on this spreadsheet as well if 1you click on the bottom tab on convergence. 1This is the same thing but I just want to show you what 1happens at any given point. 1Let me explain this spreadsheet to you. 2So this is what's the probability of 2moving left, right? 2So this is just saying, I'm just fixing a point what's 2the probability -- and you can change this -- of my 2final position being 10. 2And this essentially tells you that if I take 10 moves, for my 2final position to be 10 to the right, I have to take 10 right 2moves and 0 left moves. 2That's a typo right there, it should be moves not movest. 2If I take 20 moves to end up 10 moves to the right then I have 2to make 15 right moves and 5 left moves. 2Likewise if I take a total of 80 moves, if I think 80 flips 2of my coin to make me go left or right, in order end up 10 to 2the right, I to take 45 right moves and 35 left moves in any 2order and it will end up with 10 to the right. 2So what I want to figure out is, as I start taking a bunch 2of total moves -- here I max it out at 170 -- if I start 2flipping this coin an infinite number of times, I want to 2figure out what's the probability that my final 2position is 10 to the right. 2And I want to show you that as you take more and more moves 2the normal distribution becomes a better and better 2approximation for the binomial distribution. 2So right here, this calculates the binomial probability, just 2the way we did before and you can look at the cell 2to figure it out. 2I used left moves as a success. 2So this is 10 choose 0 and we know what that is. 2It's 10 factorial over 0 factorial over 10 minus 0 2factorial times 0.5 to the 0 times 0.5 to the 10th. 2That's where that number comes from. 2If I go to this one right here is calculated. 2Actually let me write it out because I think 2it's interesting. 2I have a total of 60 total moves, so it's 60 factorial 2over, I have to have 25 left moves so 25 factorial. 2So that's I'm 60 minus 25 factorial times the probability 2of a left move and have 25 of them, times the 2probability of a right move and I have 35 of those. 2So that's just what the binomial probability 2distribution will tell us. 2And then it figures out the mean and the variance for each 2of those circumstances and you could look at the formula. 2But the mean is just the probability of having 2a left move times the total number of moves. 2The variance is probability of left times probability of right 2times total number of moves. 2And then the normal probability, once again, I just 2use the normal probability. 2So I approximate it the same way. 2And Excel has a normal distribution function but I 2actually typed in the formula because I wanted you kind of 2see what was under the covers for that function that 2Excel actually has. 2So I actually say what's the probability of 25 left moves? 2No, 45 left moves. 2So I say the probability of 45 left moves is equal to 1 2over the standard deviation. 2So in this situation the standard deviation is 2the square root of 25. 2So it's five times 2 pi times e to the minus 1/2 times 45 minus 2the mean, minus 50 over the standard deviation, which we 2figured out was 5, squared. 2So that tells me the value of what the normal distribution 2tells me for this situation with this standard deviation 2and this mean and then I multiply that by 1 -- you don't 2see that in the formula, I don't actually write times 1 -- 2to figure out the area under the curve. 2Because remember it's a continuous distribution 2function. 2This right here just gives me the value but to figure out the 2probability of being within a foot of it I have 2to multiply by 1. 2I'm approximating really. 2I really should take the integral from there to there 2but this little rectangle is a pretty good approximation. 2In this chart I show you that as the total number of moves 2gets larger and larger the difference between what the 2normal probability distribution tells us and the binomial 2probability of distribution tells us, gets smaller and 2smaller in terms of the probability of you ending up 2to 10 moves to the right. 2And you can change this number here. 2Let me change it just to show you. 2You could say what's the probability of being 215 moves to the right? 2I think that something is happening with the floating 2point error because when you get to large factorials I 2think something weird happens out here. 2You may just have to get even further out. 2For 10 you can see clearly that it converges and I'll trying to 2figure out why I was getting those weird saw tooth patterns. 2Maybe while I do screen capture something weird is happening. 2The whole point of this was to show you that if you want to 2figure out the probability of being 10 moves to the right, as 2you take more and more flips of your coin the normal 2distribution becomes a much better approximation for the 2actual binomial distribution. 2And as you approach infinity they actually converge 2to each other. 2Anyway, that's all for this video. 2I'll actually do several more videos on the normal 2distributions because it is such an important concept. 2See you soon.",math_statistics-probability_modeling-distributions-of-data
" -  So imagine you've got an object sitting in front of this concave mirror. If you wanted to figure out where the image is formed, you can draw ray tracings. And so one ray you can draw is a parallel ray that goes through the focal point. But these rays are reversible. I don't have to draw that one. Turns out, if you send rays back along the way they came, they'll just retrace the path they came along the other way. So these rays are reversible. I send a ray parallel, it gets sent through the focal point. But if I send a ray through the focal point, it will get sent parallel. In other words, I don't have to draw this ray. I can draw this ray right here. The one that goes from the tip of the object through the focal point. That's gonna get sent parallel. So I'm gonna draw this one just for fun and then I'm gonna draw another one. You need two in order to find where the image is. I'll draw this one here. So this white line is called the principal axis. It's drawn through the center of this curved mirror. I'm gonna draw a ray that goes from the tip of the object to that center point because I know the law of reflection says that the angle in has to equal the angle out. And the angles are measured form the normal line and it just so happens that this principal axis that's usually drawn here anyways, is serving as a perfectly good normal line for this center of the mirror since it's passing through that center of the mirror in a perpendicular way. I can just use that to my advantage. I know that the angle in's gotta equal the angle out. I just have to make sure that this angle out is about, looks like that, about equal to the angle that it came in at. So these two have to be the same angle theta. And now I can find where my image is. The image of this object is gonna be at the point where they cross. So the tip of this object gets mapped to this point right here and we get an image that's upside down and it looks like that. So ray tracing is cool; it lets you find where the image is. But I mean I just kinda eyeballed this angle here. This might have been off by a little bit. It might have been off by a degree or two. If I wanted to get exactly where the image is, I'd want an equation that I could just plug into. In other words, that I could plug into how far was the object from the mirror, and how long is this focal length, and it would spit out exactly where the image is gonna be. So that's what we're gonna derive in this video. It's called the mirror equation and it'll tell us how to relate the object distance, the image distance, and the focal length. So let's do this. How do you derive it? If you look in the textbook, it looks complicated. It's not actually as bad as it looks. When I used to look at the first time, I was like, ""This is some sort of mathematical witchcraft ""I don't want to deal with."" But it's not nearly as bad as it looks. We're gonna start with drawing triangles. So we'll notice that these two angles are the same. We're gonna use this to our advantage. So we're gonna make two triangles that have these as one of their angles. So the first one, let's consider this one. Let's say one of the triangles will be from the base of this image to the center of the mirror, and then from the mirror to the tip of the image, and then from the tip of the image back down to the base of the image. So imagine this pink triangle right here, it's a right triangle 'cause that angle right here is a right angle, and it's got theta as one of its angles. But I could draw another triangle that has this angle theta. I can go from the tip of the object to the center of the mirror, and then from the center of the mirror to the base of the object, and then from the base of the object to the tip of the object and I get this blue triangle. That's also a right triangle since this angle here is a right angle. So in other words, these triangles are similar. They both have an angle theta, they both have a right angle. Or in other words, if you don't like similar triangles, just think about it this way. You could use a trig function. Pick your favorite trig function. I'm gonna pick tangent. So let's take tangent theta. I know tangent theta by definition is always the opposite over the adjacent. The opposite to this angle, we'll take this angle down here first, the opposite to that theta is this side. What does that side mean? That's the height of the image. So I'm gonna call that ""hi"" for image height. That's how tall the image is. So I know that this is gonna equal height of the image divided by the adjacent side to this angle here is this distance right here and we're gonna give that a name. That's just how far the image is from the mirror. So we give this a name, we call this distance from the mirror to the image, we call that the image distance. And it's measured from the center of the mirror. So not from this end right here, this little tip part, but from wherever the center of the mirror is. It's measured from this point right here. And that's this adjacent side since this is how far that image is from the center of the mirror, so I'll call that ""di"" since it's the image distance. But that was for this theta down here. I know that tangent of theta, this is also a theta up here. I can use the same relationship for this theta. And I know that tangent of this theta also has to be opposite over adjacent, but the opposite of this theta is this side right here. And what is that side? That's just the height of the object. So I'll call that ""ho"". That's the object height, so the opposite side for this theta is the object height. And then you divide by what? You divide by the adjacent side. That's just gonna be this distance from the mirror to the object. We'll give that a name, and if you guessed object distance, then you guessed right. This is gonna be the object distance. And again we measure it from the center of the mirror, not some curved portion that sticks out over here, but from the center part of the mirror. So that's the adjacent side to this theta down here, so I'm gonna write that as ""do"". And so this is an important relationship. This is actually given a name just by itself. This isn't the equation we're hunting for, but it's so important it gets its own name. Just part of this derivation gets its own name. It's called the magnification equation but it's usually not written this way. People usually write it as hi and then they divide by ho. So you get hi divided by ho equals, and then you multiply both sides by di, you get di over do. So a lot of times this is called the magnification equation. It gives you a way to find what the height of the image is. So we were lookin' for a way to find how far the image is from the mirror, but this lets you figure out, okay, you also need to know how big is it gonna be? So if we solve this height of the image, we get the height of the image is the height of the object times some factor, and that factor's just gonna be the image distance divided by the object distance. Here's the thing, though. Look at. This image got flipped over. So if we define this image distance as positive if it's on the same side as the object, we get a flipped over image, that'd be like a negative height. So since we want to represent flipped over images with a negative value, we actually write this equation down with a negative inside of here. We say that the height of the image is equal to negative ho, di over do, or you could put the negative up here, too. So we stick a negative over here. That way we know that if you get a negative value for the image height, you know it's flipped over. So in other words, if the value I got for hi was negative three centimeters, that means I'd get an image that had a height of three centimeters, but it'd be flipped over and that's what the negative represents. Okay, so that's kind of a side note. This is not what we're trying to derive. We're trying to derive a formula that would give us the image distance based on object distance and focal length. So we need to do another set of triangles. What we'll do now is instead of considering these thetas here, we'll consider these angles here. Now I can't call them theta 'cause we already called those theta, so I'll call these phi. So these angles also have to be the same because any time you have a line and then you cut another line through it, these angles here will always be the same. So we could do the same game. We could play the same game we played for theta with these phis. We'll form two triangles, each triangle's gonna have phi as one of the angles. So for the first one, we'll do this object height as one side over here to the base of phi and then back up over to here. And then for the other one we need to also have a triangle that has phi in it, so we'll do this from here to here, down to there, and then back up to phi. So we've got two triangles. This triangle and this triangle, and they both have phi and they both have a right angle. So these are also similar triangles. In other words, we'll play the same game. We'll say that tangent of this phi is gonna have to equal the opposite over the adjacent. The opposite to this phi is this side which is just ho. So we can write ho divided by the adjacent now is not do, 'cause this side only goes to here. It doesn't go the whole way to the mirror. It only goes that far. So that's the entire object distance minus this piece right over here. So if I subtracted this much from the object distance, I'd get the remaining amount which is the adjacent part of this triangle. So this distance from the mirror to the focal point is given a name. It's called the focal length and we represent it with an f. So a little confusing 'cause f represents both a point and it represents the length from the mirror to that point. So f is gonna represent that length as well. So this adjacent side we could write as the object distance minus the focal length since this remaining part right here is the adjacent side which is object distance minus the focal length. But we know that this phi is also equal to this phi. So I can do tangent of theta for this phi, the opposite side would now be this side. What is that? What is this side of the triangle? That's just equal to the height of the image. This side is the same as the image height so I can say that this whole thing, tangent of phi, has to equal opposite over adjacent. This time the opposite of phi is the image height. And we divide by this distance right here, which is just the focal length. So this adjacent side for this triangle is simply the focal length. So I'll just divide by f and so what I've got are two equations that I'm gonna put together and we will get the mirror equation out of this. There's different ways to proceed at this point. What I'm gonna do is I don't want ho or hi in either of these, so I'm just gonna solve this one here for ho over hi. And I get ho over hi, so imagine dividing both sides by hi, and then multiplying both sides by do minus f, and I'd get ho over hi equals do minus f, the focal length, divided by the focal length. But I could do the same thing up here. I can get ho over hi. It's just gonna equal do over di. So that's all you have to do is divide both sides by hi and then multiply both sides by do. But this left-hand side right here is the same as this left-hand side right here. 1So we know that ho over hi 1already equals do minus f over f, 1and up here we know that ho over hi equals do over di, 1so that means that do minus f over f 1has to also equal do over di 1since both of these expressions equal ho over hi. 1So we can set them all equal 1'cause they're all equal to the same thing: 1ho over hi. 1And now we're gonna solve this. 1We're just gonna clean it up. 1The left-hand side I can write, 1I'll just stop using colors here, 1the left-hand side is gonna be do over f minus one, 1since f over f just equals one. 1And that's gotta equal do over di. 1And now we can divide both sides by do. 1If I divide both sides by do I get one over f, 1since the do cancels, 1minus one over do equals, 1and then the do will cancel with this do on top, 1and I just get one over di. 1And now we made it except it's usually written 1with this one over do added on the right. 1If we add one over do to both sides, 1we finally get the expression we wanted, 1which is one over the object distance, 1plus one over the image distance, 1equals one over the focal length. 1It's a pretty simple formula. 1It took a little bit of effort to get to this, 1but this is called the mirror equation 1and it relates the focal length of the mirror 1to the image distance and the object distance. 1In other words, 1if you now how far you put the object from the mirror, 1and you know the focal length of the mirror, 1that lets you figure out exactly where the image distance is 1instead of just kinda eyeballing it and using a protractor. 1This'll let you solve for where that image is exactly. 1And if you couple it 1with this magnification equation up here, 1you can also figure out the exact height of the image. 1Now you might be feeling a little sketchy 1about this negative sign. 1I mean I kinda threw it in quick over here. 1What's going on with this negative? 1In fact how do we know if any of this stuff 1is negative or positive? 1Well the convention that I use, 1that a lot of textbooks use now, 1is the one where 1focal lengths will be positive for concave mirrors, 1just like this mirror right here, this is a concave mirror. 1But if it was bent the other way, 1if the mirror looked like this, it'd be a convex mirror, 1and that would be a negative focal length. 1And it kinda makes sense if the mirror was bent this way, 1the focal point is kinda back this way 1which is kinda behind it, 1so it makes sense that it's sort of negative. 1And the object distance over here, 1if it's on the same side as your eye, 1if you're using this correctly, 1your eye should be over on this side, 1you would see an object right here 1but you'd also see an image of that object right here. 1And if this object is on the same side 1as the mirror as your eye, which it should be, 1then this object distance is positive. 1It's basically always positive 1unless you've got some double set of mirrors 1or something weird happening. 1If you got a single mirror, there's no craziness goin' on, 1this object distance is just always defined to be positive 1using the convention that we're using up here. 1And again, there are other conventions you can use. 1But this is the one used in a lot of textbooks these days. 1The di is a little trickier. 1The di is also positive if 1that image is on the same side as your eye, 1like it is right here. 1So this image 1would be considered a positive image distance 1since it's on this side. 1If the image got formed on this side of the mirror, 1say you formed an image right here, 1that would be a negative image distance. 1If this was five centimeters behind the mirror, 1we'd consider that 1a negative five centimeter image distance. 1And if you use that convention with this mirror equation, 1you'll get a correct relationship 1between the object distance, 1image distance, and the focal length. 1And if you use that same sign convention 1with this magnification equation, 1you'll also get the exact height of the image 1and if that image height comes out negative, 1you'll know that it got flipped upside down. 1And if the image height comes out positive, 1you know that the image will stay right-side up. 1So recapping, using a bunch of similar triangles, 1we were able to derive a mirror equation 1that relates the object distance, 1image distance, and focal length, 1and along the way we derived a magnification equation 1that relates the heights of the image and object 1to the distances of the image and object. 1And you have to be very careful with signs. 1Even though the object distance 1is basically always positive, 1focal length can be positive or negative. 1Focal length will be positive for concave mirrors, 1and it'll be negative for convex mirrors. 1Image distances will be positive 1if they're on the same side of the mirror as your eye, 1if they're in front of the mirror. 1But they'll be negative if they're behind the mirror. 1And again this is not 1the only sign convention you could use, 1but it's as good as any other sign convention 1and it's the one used in a lot of textbooks these days.",science_physics_geometric-optics
" - So for what value of c, or values of c, is x minus five? Let me write it this way. For what c is x minus five a factor of p of x? I encourage you to pause the video and try to work through it. That p is actually a lower case p. P of x. All right, so I'm assuming you have attempted this. We just have to realize, okay, if x minus five is a factor of p of x, that means you could write p of x, let me do this in that green color, that means you could write p of x as being equal to x minus five times some other business, times some other polynomial. So times some other polynomial. I don't know, let's just call it g of x maybe, g of x, and this would be a 2nd degree polynomial. So what would p of five have to be? Well p of five would have to zero. Five would have to be a root of this polynomial. You see it right over here. If you replace this with the five, then this is going to be a five, and this is going to be a five. It doesn't matter what g of five is. This is going to be zero. So if x minus five is a factor, if and only if p of five is equal to zero. You could say that five is a root of the polynomial p. P of five is equal to zero. So let's just set p of five equal to zero and then try to solve for c. All right, so we're going to get five to the 3rd power. So this right over here, five to the 3rd, so p of five. P, let me just write it down, p of five is equal to five to the 3rd is 125 plus two times five squared. So that's two times 25, plus 50, plus c times five, plus five c plus 10. That needs to be equal to zero. Now let's see, if we were to add 125 to 50 to 10, we are going to get 175, 185. So we get 185 plus five c is equal to zero. Subtract 185 from both sides, you get five c is equal to -185, or c is equal to -185 over five, which is going to be, let's see, it's -185 over five, which is equal to, let's see, five goes into 180, let's see, it goes into, well it's five, let's see, it's going to be 30. Five times 30 is 150. Then we'll have another 35 to go, so it's going to be 37, -37. Is that right? Five times 30 is 150, five times seven is 35, yep, -37. And we're done. If this was x to the 3rd plus 2 x squared minus 37 x plus 10, then x minus five would be a factor of this polynomial.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-1
" -  Plants and trees are not just great at creating their own food from sunlight, but they're also excellent in moving that food around. When they have excess of food, they move it to their storage organs. For example, if this was a carrot or a potato plant, then they would move that excess food down. So they move the excess food down and store it for future. And now let's say maybe during the winter season there isn't much sunlight so they cannot photosynthesize. So they're not able to get a lot of food. Now, they can move this food up to wherever they want. So they can move it back from the storage organs to the place where they need, maybe the growing areas. And this process of moving the food around wherever they want, we give a name to it, we call it translocation. Translocation. This is basically plants and trees moving the food around to the places they need. But the big question is, how do they do that? I mean, for one, how do they even understand which part of the plant body needs food because they don't have a brain? And secondly, what mechanism do they use to transport that food up or down according to their needs? Well, let's find out. Now before we continue, let's back up a little bit. We've already seen in previous videos that plants and trees consists of pipe-like structures to transport stuff around, that starts from the roots all the way to the leaves, and we call these structures vascular tissues. And there are two kinds, xylem that transports water and minerals from the soil to the different parts of the body, and phloem, which mostly transports food. Now if these terms look new to you or you need a refresher on this, then you can go back and watch our previous videos on intro to vascular tissues and videos on xylem and transportation. But if you feel comfortable, then let's continue. Now in this video, since we wanna talk about translocation, meaning transportation of food, we are going to be concentrating on phloem. So translocation happens inside the phloem. Food gets transferred in them, but how? Well, let's see. Let me draw xylem and phloem. So let's say this is the xylem tissue which has water in it, this is going to be important for us as well, and here is our phloem. Phloem mostly contains sugar molecules dissolved in water forming a very thick sugary sap, which is food for them. And if you're wondering what these things are over here at the sides, that is some leftover cytoplasm. The cells don't lose all of their cytoplasm. And similarly, this is the cell walls. They have developed gaps in between. So they have not lost their cell walls like in xylem, some gap is developed so that the food can, this whole sap can move throughout the phloem. And if you're wondering why it is structured like this, we'll talk a little bit about that towards the end. Anyways, imagine a couple of cells next to phloem. Let's assume these are far apart, okay, not so close and let's assume this cell has a lot of sugar molecules in it. And imagine this cell doesn't have much sugar molecules, it needs a lot. Let's say it's one of the growing regions of this plant. So it needs a lot of sugars. So how do we transport the sugar from here to here is the question? Well, you can kind of guess the process. We take some of the sugars, put it into the phloem, then we make sure it transports through the phloem till here, and then we remove the sugar and put it into this cell. That makes sense, right? But a couple of questions could be how does the phloem know in which direction to transport this food? Because that cell which is in need of sugars can be anywhere. It can be below it or it can be above this as well. So how does it know whether it has to go down or up? And secondly, how do you even move this thick sugary sap through the phloem? So let's put this back over here and let's see how this works. So the first step as you predicted is to put the sugar into the phloem tube. I'm just gonna call that loading. And this process is an active process. What does that mean? Active. Well, think about it. If the concentration over here of sugars is less than over here, then sugars will automatically diffuse from higher to lower concentration. But pretty soon the concentration will equalize. How do you move even more sugars there? Well, that requires energy. The cells have to spend some energy to move the sugar from lower to higher concentration. So, by using energy, the sugars need to be transported into the phloem. And because energy is utilized for this process, we say it's an active process. Now see what happens. Because of a lot of sugar, the concentration of sugar is much higher in this region compared to any other regions. And remember, nature always likes to balance the concentration out. So one way to reduce the concentration is to put the sugar back. But remember that's not possible, we're not doing that. So what else can nature do? Well, there's xylem right next with a lot of water. So you know what's gonna happen? Water will start flowing from xylem into the phloem, to this part of the phloem because of osmosis. So let me write that as step two. Remember osmosis it's the process in which solvent flows, like water starts flowing from a low concentration region to a higher concentration region. Basically water is flowing to try and dilute this concentration. Okay, what does that do? Well, because a lot of water is flowing in, this region of the phloem starts puffing up over there. This increases the pressure over here. And what I mean by that is you can imagine these walls are pressing on this solution, squeezing that solution a lot. Now, what do you think will happen if I squeeze this solution a lot? Well, it'll automatically start moving from here to a region where there is low pressure. It's kind of like squeezing a water balloon. And where do you think is the pressure lower? The pressure is lower where there is less sugar concentration, right? Because if there's less sugar concentration, there will be less water over here and that's exactly where you need to send your sugar molecules. So if on the top there is a cell which has very low sugar concentration, automatically that part will have low pressure, automatically this side will move up. If it turns out that somewhere in the bottom there is low concentration, automatically the pressure over there will be very low and the sap will move down. And this is how the pressure decides in what direction the sap will move. So in our example, the sap will move down from here to here. Let's call that as our step three, and we can call this the bulk flow, the bulk flow driven by pressure. And the reason we are calling it bulk flow is because this whole thing is a solution, remember. Even though I've put dots over here, this is one single solution. And so the whole solution moves down, not just this part. All right? So let me show you what that will look like. So as the solution moves, this pressure is relieved. Let me get that back to normal. And so due to the high pressure over here, this whole solution will start moving like this. The whole thing will move from high pressure to low pressure until it reaches over here. And then finally the sugar reaches the low pressure region. Because there is less concentration of sugar, it will move out of phloem and it can now be taken up by this cell. And so this we'll call it as step four, unloading happens. The sugars get unloaded from the phloem tube. So let's unload that sugar from the phloem into the required cell. And finally, remember that region which had a lot of concentration of sugar had a lot of water due to the osmosis. Well now, that concentration has lowered so, that water will move back to xylem. So in step five, again, osmosis happens and the water moves back and that's how translocation happens inside plants. Now before we summarize and wind up this video, one question we need to address is why phloem structure is a little different than that of xylem. Why does it have cytoplasm, little bit of cytoplasm left? Why are the end walls not completely gone like in the xylem? Well, that's because these cells are alive. Phloem has life cells. In contrast, xylem has dead cells. And so xylem cells can afford to lose all of their stuff because they are dead, right? But phloem cells need a little bit of cytoplasm and their cell walls to stay alive. Now that could raise even more questions. First of all, you may be wondering, how can cells stay alive without a nucleus or without a mitochondria? How can these cells be alive? Well, in fact, you know how they are staying alive? They have a partner cells which I have not shown over here, but each cell is connected to a partner. Let me show you what would that look like if I were to draw those. So these are the partner cells and they have all the stuff needed to keep these cells alive. In fact, they are life partners, okay? And that's why these cells are called companion cells. 1All right? 1And so in reality, if you're wondering, 1when you want to load the sugars, 1you have to first load it into the companion cell 1and then it goes into the phloem. 1Similarly, while unloading, 1it first goes into the companion cell 1and then it goes out of the phloem. 1But that's a small detail. 1We don't have to worry too much about that, 1so let me get rid of those. 1So it's those companion cells that keep them alive. 1But another question you might be wondering 1is why do we have to go through all that trouble 1to keep these cells alive? 1Why is it necessary that these cells need to be alive? 1Well, the answer is in this process. 1You see, we just saw that in order to load the sugar 1into the phloem, that requires energy. 1It's an active process 1and the cell can only generate energy if it is alive. 1So if the cells were dead, like in xylem, 1they wouldn't be able to generate energy, 1they wouldn't be able to load sugar, 1they wouldn't be able to accept that sugar molecules. 1It would just diffuse back 1and then the phloem transport wouldn't work. 1And xylem cells don't need to be alive 1because the mechanism of xylem 1is only based on physical forces like suction 1or the pressure from the bottom, from the roots, right? 1You don't need the cells. 1The cells don't need to use any energy 1so they can afford to be dead, but phloem needs to be alive. 1All right, that's pretty much it. 1So, let's quickly summarize. 1What did we learn in this video? 1We saw that plants and trees can move the food up or down 1based on their requirement and we called this translocation, 1and this happens inside the phloem tissues. 1And how do these sugars go from one place to another? 1Well, in the first step, we have loading 1where the sugars get loaded actively into the phloem tubes 1and this requires energy, 1that's why it's called as an active process 1and that's why these cells need to stay alive. 1And in doing so, 1because the concentration over here has increased, 1water starts flowing from xylem into the phloem 1to try and decrease that concentration due to osmosis. 1And because of that, a lot of water comes in 1and the cell now kind of all there puffs up. 1I like to imagine that way because now you can see 1that there's a lot of pressure over there. 1And then because there is high pressure region over here, 1it automatically wants to move 1towards the low pressure region. 1And the low pressure region is the region 1where there is less concentration of sugars. 1And as a result, the whole sap starts moving 1towards the low concentration region. 1And so this is that step three, which is a bulk flow. 1It starts moving, the whole sap moves 1from higher to lower concentration, 1and now that pressure is relieved. 1And then in step four, the sugars automatically diffuse out 1because outside there is less concentration 1and that can now be taken up by the cell, 1which we will call it as unloading. 1And then finally, 1the excess water drains back into the xylem 1because the concentration has decreased. 1So it goes back 1and that's how translocation works in plants and trees.",science_class-10-biology_in-in-life-processes
" We've learned about matrix addition, matrix subtraction, matrix multiplication. So you might be wondering, is there the equivalent of matrix division? And before we get into that, let me introduce some concepts to you. And then we'll see that there is something that maybe isn't exactly division, but it's analogous to it. So before we introduce that, I'm going to introduce you to the concept of an identity matrix. So an identity matrix is a matrix. And I'll denote that by capital I. When I multiply it times another matrix-- actually I don't know if I should write that dot there-- but anyway, when I multiply times another matrix, I get that other matrix. Or when I multiply that matrix times the identity matrix, I get the matrix again. And it's important to realize when we're doing matrix multiplication, that direction matters. I've actually given you some information here that-- we can't just assume when we were doing regular multiplication that, a times b is always equal to b times a. It's important when we're doing matrix multiplication, to confirm that it matters what direction you do the multiplication in. But anyway, and this works both ways only if we're dealing with square matrices. It can work in one direction or another if this matrix is non-square, but it won't work in both. And you can think about that just in terms of how we learned matrix multiplication, why that happens. But anyway, I've defined this matrix. Now what does this matrix actually look like? It's actually pretty simple. If we have a 2x2 matrix, the identity matrix is 1, 0, 0, 1. If you want 3x3, it's 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1. I think you see the pattern. If you want a 4x4, the identity matrix is 1, 0, 0, 0 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1. So you can see all that any matrix is, for a given dimension-- I mean we could extend this to an n by n matrix-- is you just have 1's along this top left to bottom right diagonals. And everything else is a 0. So I've told you that. Let's prove that it actually works. Let's take this matrix and multiply it times another matrix. And confirm that that matrix doesn't change. So if we take 1, 0, 0, 1. Let's multiply it times-- let's do a general matrix. Just so you see that this works for all numbers. a, b, c, d. So what does that equal? We're going to multiply this row times this column. 1 times a plus 0 times c is a. And that row times this column. 1 times b plus 0 times d. That's b. Then this row times this column. 0 times a plus 1 times c is c. Then finally, this row times this column. 0 times b plus 1 times d. Well, that's just d. There you have it. And it might be a fun exercise to try it the other way around as well. And actually it's an even better exercise to try this with a 3x3. And you'll see it all works out. And a good exercise for you is to think about why it works. And if you think about it, it's because you're getting your row information from here and your column information from here. And essentially, anytime you're multiplying, let's say this vector times this vector, you're multiplying the corresponding terms and then adding them, right? So if you have a 1 and a 0, the 0 is going to cancel out anything but the first term in this column vector. So that's why you're just left with a. And that's why it's going to cancel out everything but the first term in this column vector. And that's why you're left with just b. And similarly, this will cancel out everything but the second term. That's why you're left with just c there. This times this. You're just left with c. This times this. You're just left with d. And that same thing applies when you go to 3x3 or n by n vectors. So that's interesting. You have the identity vector. Now if we wanted to complete our analogy-- so let's think about it. We know in regular mathematics, if I have 1 times a, I get a. And we also know that 1 over a times a-- this is just regular math, this has nothing to do with matrices-- is equal to 1. And you know, we call this the inverse of a. And that's also the same thing as dividing by the number a. So is there a matrix analogy? Let me switch colors, because I've used this green a little bit too much. Is there a matrix, where if I were to have the matrix a, and I multiply it by this matrix-- and I'll call that the inverse of a-- is there a matrix where I'm left with, not the number 1, but I'm left with the 1 equivalent in the matrix world? Where I'm left with the identity matrix? And it would be extra nice if I could actually switch this multiplication around. So A times A inverse should also be equal to the identity matrix. And if you think about it, if both of these things are true, then actually not only is A inverse the inverse of A, but A is also the inverse of A inverse. So they're each other's inverses. That's all I meant to say. And it turns out there is such a matrix. It's called the inverse of A, as I've said three times already. And I will now show you how to calculate it. So let's do that. And we'll see calculating it for a 2x2 is fairly straightforward. Although you might think it's a little mysterious as to how people came up with the mechanics of it, or the algorithm for it. 3x3 becomes a little hairy. 4x4 will take you all day. 5x5, you're almost definitely going to do a careless mistake if you did the inverse of a 5x5 matrix. And that's better left to a computer. But anyway, how do we calculate the matrix? So let's do that, and then we'll confirm that it really is the inverse. So if I have a matrix A, and that is a, b, c, d. And I want to calculate its inverse. Its inverse is actually-- and this is going to seem like voodoo. In future videos, I will give you a little bit more intuition for why this works, or I'll actually show you how this came about. But for now it's almost better just to memorize the steps, just so you have the confidence that you know that you can calculate an inverse. It's equal to 1 over this number times this. a times d minus b times c. ad minus bc. And this quantity down here, ad minus bc, that's called the determit of the matrix A. And we're going to multiply that. This is just a number. This is just a scalar quantity. And we're going to multiply that by-- you switch the a and the d. You switch the top left and the bottom right. So you're left with d and a. And you make these two, you make the bottom left and the top right, you make them negative. So minus c minus b. And the determit-- once again, this is something that you're just going to take a little bit on faith right now. In future videos, I promise to give you more tuition. But it's actually kind of sophisticated to learn what the determit is. And if you're doing this in your high school class, you kind of just have to know how to calculate it. Although I don't like telling you that. So what is this? This is also call the determit of A. So you might see on an exam, figure out the determit of A. So let me just tell you that. And that's denoted by A in absolute value signs. And that's equal to ad minus bc. So another way of saying this, this could be 1 over the determit. So you could write A inverse is equal to 1 over the determit of A times d minus b minus c, a. Anyway you look at it. But let's apply this to a real problem, and you'll see that it's actually not so bad. So let's change letters, just so you know it doesn't always have to be an A. Let's say I have a matrix B. And the matrix B is 3-- I'm just going to pick random numbers-- minus 4, 2 minus 5. Let's calculate B inverse. So B inverse is going to be equal to 1 over the determit of B. What's the determit? It's 3 times minus 5 minus 2 times minus 4. So 3 times minus 5 is minus 15, minus 2 times minus 4. 2 times minus 4 is minus 8. We're going to subtract that. So it's plus 8. And we're going to multiply that times what? Well, we switched these two terms. So it's minus 5 and 3. And we just make these two terms negative. Minus 2 and 4. 4 was minus 4, so now it becomes 4. And let's see if we can simplify this a little bit. So B inverse is equal to minus 15 plus 8. That's minus 7. So this is minus 1/7. So the determit of B-- we could write B's determit-- is equal to minus 7. So that's minus 1/7 times minus 5, 4, minus 2, 3. Which is equal to-- this is just a scalar, this is just a number, so we multiply it times each of the elements-- so that is equal to minus, minus, plus. That's 5/7. 5/7 minus 4/7. 1Let's see. 1Positive 2/7. 1And then minus 3/7. 1It's a little hairy. 1We ended up with fractions here and things. 1But let's confirm that this really is the inverse 1of the matrix B. 1Let's multiply them out. 1So before I do that I have to create some space. 1I don't even need this anymore. 1There you go. 1OK. 1So let's confirm that that times this, or this times 1that, is really equal to the identity matrix. 1So let's do that. 1So let me switch colors. 1So B inverse is 5/7, if I haven't made 1any careless mistakes. 1Minus 4/7. 12/7. 1And minus 3/7. 1That's B inverse. 1And let me multiply that by B. 13 minus 4. 12 minus 5. 1And this is going to be the product matrix. 1I need some space to do my calculations. 1Let me switch colors. 1I'm going to take this row times this column. 1So 5/7 times 3 is what? 115/7. 1Plus minus 4/7 times 2. 1So minus 4/7 times 2 is minus-- let me make sure 1that's right-- 5 times 3 is 15/7. 1Minus 4-- oh right, right-- 4 times 2, so minus 8/7. 1Now we're going to multiply this row times this column. 1So 5 times minus 4 is minus 20/7. 1Plus minus 4/7 times minus 5. 1That is plus 20/7. 1My brain is starting to slow down, having to do matrix 1multiplications with fractions with negative numbers. 1But this is a good exercise for multiple 1parts of the brain. 1But anyway. 1So let's go down and do this term. 1So now we're going to multiply this row times this column. 1So 2/7 times 3 is 6/7. 1Plus minus 3/7 times 2. 1So that's minus 6/7. 1One term left. 1Home stretch. 12/7 times minus 4 is minus 8/7. 1Plus minus 3/7 times minus 5. 1So those negatives cancel out, and we're left with plus 15/7. 1And if we simplify, what do we get? 115/7 minus 8/8 is 7/7. 1Well that's just 1. 1This is 0, clearly. 1This is 0. 16/7 minus 6/7 is 0. 1And then minus 8/7 plus 15/7, that's 7/7. 1That's 1 again. 1And there you have it. 1We've actually managed to inverse this matrix. 1And it was actually harder to prove that it was the inverse 1by multiplying, just because we had to do all this fraction 1and negative number math. 1But hopefully that satisfies you. 1And you could try it the other way around to confirm that if 1you multiply it the other way, you'd also get 1the identity matrix. 1But anyway, that is how you calculate the 1inverse of a 2x2. 1And as we'll see in the next video, calculating by the 1inverse of a 3x3 matrix is even more fun. 1See you soon.",math_precalculus_matrices
" Welcome to my presentation on level three linear, yeah, level three linear equations. [LAUGH] Okay. So let me, let's, let's make up a problem. Let's say I had X plus 2x plus 3 is equal to, minus 7x minus 5. Well, in all of these linear equations, the first things that we, the first thing that we try to do is, get all of our variables on one side of the equation, and then get all of our concept terms on the other side of the equation. And then it actually will become a level one linear equation. So, the first thing we can do is we can try to simplify each of the sides. Well we, on this, on this left side we have this X plus 2x. Well, what is X plus 2x? Well that's like saying I have one apple and now I have two apples. So here I have one X and now I have two more Xs that I'm adding together. So that's equal 3x, 3x plus 3 is equal to minus 7x minus 5. Now let's bring the 7x over onto the left-hand side. And we could do that by adding 7x to both sides, 7x. This is a review. We, we're adding the opposite. So, it's negative 7x, so we add 7x so that's why. And we do that, become the right side, these two will cancel. And the left side, we get 10x plus 3 equals, and on the right side, all we have left is the negative 5. Almost there, now we're at a level, what is this, a level two problem. And now we just have to take this 3 and move it to the other side. And we can do that by subtracting 3 from both sides. That's a 3 minus 3. The left-hand side, the 3s cancel out, that's why we subtract it in the first place. And you have 10x equals and then minus 5 minus 3, well that equals minus 8. Now, we just multiply both sides of this equation by 1 over 10, or the reciprocal of 10, which is the coefficient on x, times 1 over 10. You could also, some people would say, well, we're just dividing both side by 10 which is essential what we're doing. If you divide by 10, that's the same thing as multiplying by 1 over 10. Well, anyway, the left-hand side, 1 over 10 times 10. Well, that equals 1, so we're just left with x equals negative 8 over 10. And that can be reduced further. They both share the common factor 2. So you divide by 2. So it's minus 4 over 5. I think that's right, assuming that I didn't make any careless mistakes. Let's do another problem. Let's say I had 5, that's a 5x minus 3 minus 7x equals x plus 8. And in general if you wanna work this out before I give you how I do it that now's a good time to actually pause the video. And you could, you could try to work it out and then, play it again and, and see what I have to say about it. But assuming you wanna hear it, let me go and do it. So let's do the same thing. We, first of all, we can merge these two Xs on the left-hand side. Remember, you can't add the 5 and the 3 because the 3 is just a constant term while the 5 is 5 times x. But the 5 times x and the negative 7 times actually can merge. So 5, you just add the coefficient. So, it's 5 and negative 7. So, that becomes negative 2x minus 3 is equal to x plus 8. Now, if we wanna take this x that's on the right-hand side and put it over the left-hand side, we can just subtract x from both sides. The left-hand side becomes minus 3x minus 3 is equal to, these two Xs cancel out, is equal to 8. Now, we can just add 3 to both sides to get rid of that constant term 3 on left hand-side. These two 3's will cancel out. And you get minus 3x is equal to 11. Now, you just multiply both sides by negative one-third. And once again, this is just the same thing as dividing both sides by negative 3. And you get x equals negative 11 over 3. Actually let's, let's, just for fun, let's check this just to see. And the cool thing about algebra is if you have enough time, you can always make sure you got the right answer. So we have 5x, so we have 5 times negative 11 over 3. So that's, I'm just, I'm just gonna take this and substitute it back into the original equation. And you might wanna try that out, too. So you have minus 55 over 3, that's just 5 times negative 11 over 3, that's a 3, minus 3. And what's 3? Three could also be written as, minus 9 over 3. I'm skipping some steps, but I think you, you know your fractions pretty good by this point. So that's minus 9 over 3. And then, minus 7x is the same thing, as plus 77 over 3. Because we have the minus 7 times minus 11, so it's plus 77. And, and the equation is saying that should equal minus 11 over 3, that's what x is, plus an 8 is nothing more than 24 over 3. Let's add this up. Minus 55 minus 9, that's minus 64, if I'm right, yeah, that's minus 64. And then, plus 77 minus 64 plus 77 is 13. So the left-hand side becomes 13 over 3. And on the right-hand side minus 11 plus 24, well that's 13 and we still have over 3. So looks like we got the right solution. It checks out. So the correct answer was minus 11 over 3. Hopefully you're ready by now to, do some level three problems. The only thing that makes this a little bit more complicated than level two is you just have to remember to merge the variables in the beginning, and, know that you could subtract variables or constants from both sides. Have fun.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-simple-linear-equations-in-one-variable-icse
" Let's see if taking the transpose of a matrix does anything to its determit. So a good place to start is just with the 2-by-2 scenario. So let's do the 2-by-2 scenario. So if I start with some matrix here. Let me just take its determit. So a, b, c, d. And then let me take its determit. So this is going to be equal to ad minus bc. Let me take the transpose of this and then take its determit. So that would be the determit of ac, the columns turn into the rows, and then bd, the rows turn into the columns. What is this going to be equal to? This is going to be equal to ad minus bc again. The only thing that happened is these two guys got swapped and they multiply times each other anyway. So these two things are equivalent. So at least for the 2-by-2 case, the determit of some matrix is equal to the determit of the transpose of that matrix. Now, that's just the 2-by-2 case. Now, I'm going to make an inductive argument, or I could just say an argument by induction, to show that this works for all n by n, for all cases. And the way you construct an argument by induction is you assume that it's true for the n-by-n case. So let's assume that for n by n, and let's say I have some matrix. Let me call it matrix B, and let's say it's an n-by-n matrix, we assume that the determit of any matrix B that's n by n is equal to the determit of B's transpose. That's where we started off with our inductive argument. And then we see if given this, if given that, is it true of n plus 1 by n plus 1 matrix? Because if we can, if we can say, look, given that it's true for the n-by-n case, it's going to be true for the n plus 1 by n plus 1 case, then we're done because we know it's true for the base case, the 2-by-2 case, which you could say, well, that's your first n by n. So if it's true for the 2 by 2 case, then it'll be true for the 3-by-3 case, because that's just one increment. But then if it's true for the 3-by-3 case, then it'll be true for the 4-by-4 case. And if it's true for the 4-by-4 case, it'll be true for the 5-by-5 case, and you just keep going up like that. So when you do a proof by induction, you prove a base case, and then you prove that if it's true for n, or in this case an n-by-n determit, if you can prove that given it's true for an n-by-n determit, it's going to be true for an n plus 1 by n plus 1 determit or an n plus 1 by n plus 1 matrix, then you have completed your proof. So let's see if this is the case. So let me construct an n plus 1 by n plus 1 matrix. So let's say I have my matrix A, my favorite letter to use for matrices, I think the entirely linear algebra's favorite letter to use for matrices. And let's say it's an n plus 1 by n plus 1 matrix. And just to simplify my notation let's just say that m is equal to n plus 1. So we could call it an m-by-m matrix. And what is it going to look like? Let's draw its entries right here. I'm going to draw more than the normal amount of entries. a11, this is its first row, a12, all the way to a1m. We have m columns, which is the same thing as m plus 1. That's not m times 1 columns. This is m plus 1 as well. And then we do our second row right here. a21, a22, a23, all the way to a2m. Then you have your third row right here: a31, a32, a33, all the way to a3m. And then you go all the way down here. At the end you have your mth row, which you could also say is your m plus 1 row. So it's your mth row, first column, and then you have a sub m2, and then a sub m3, all the way to a sub mm. Fair enough. Now, let me draw the transpose of A. So a transpose is also going to be an n plus 1 by n plus 1 matrix, which you could also write as an m-by-m matrix. I'm just going to have to take the transpose of this. So the transpose of that, this row becomes a column, so it becomes a11, and this entry right here is a12. It's this entry right there. Then you can go all the way down to a1m. Then this pink row becomes a pink column here, a21-- I wanted to do it in pink. You have a21, a22, you have an a23, and it goes all the way down to a2m. You have your green row right here, it's your third one, so it's a31, a32, a33, all the way down to a3m. And then we can just skip a bunch of rows in this case, but it's columns in this case. So you just draw some dots and you have am1, am2. I'm just going down this guy, but this row is now going to become-- which was the last row. It's now going to become the last column. am3, all the way down to amm. And I have my transpose. Now, let's take the determit of A. Let me do it in purple. So the determit of my matrix A, we could just go down this first row up here. It's going to be equal to a11 times the determit of its submatrix, so it's the determit of this submatrix right here. We could call that the submatrix a sub 11. We've seen this notation before. So it's the determit of a sub 11, and then it is minus a12 times the determit of its submatrix, so you cross out that row and that column. So that is going to be a sub 12, and you're going to go all the way to-- and I don't what the sign on that is, so we could call it negative 1 to the 1 plus m-- that'll give us the right sign for the checkerboard pattern-- times the determit of the submatrix for this guy. So we call it a1m, where you cross out that guy's row, that guy's column, and you're just left with all of this stuff over here. Fair enough. Now, let's look at the determit of a transpose. We learned earlier, you don't have to go down the first row or you don't even go down a row. You could go down a column. Let me be clear. So for our determit of A, we went down this row, and our submatrices, this was my first submatrix. My second submatrix, you know what it looks like. You would cross out the second column and that row, and whatever's left over would be the second submatrix and so on and so forth. But for our determit of A transpose, let's just go down this first column and get the submatrices like that. So this is going to be equal to-- let's get our first term right here. a sub 11 times the determit of its submatrix. So what's the determit of its submatrix? It's going to be-- its submatrix, you cross out its row and its column, and you're going to be left with this thing right here. Now, an interesting question is how does this thing that I've just squared off, this guy's submatrix, relate to this guy's submatrix? Well, if you look at it carefully, this row from a22 to a2m has now become a column from a22 to a2m. This row, which is the next one, from a32 to a3m has now become a column from a32 to a3m. If you keep going down this last row, it has now become this column. So this guy's submatrix or the thing we're going to have to take the determit of right here is equal to the transpose of this guy. So this is equal to a sub 11 transpose. And if you go through it, we go minus this guy, minus a12 times the determit of his submatrix. And if we cross out this guy's row and that guy's column, what is that going to look like? His submatrix is going to look like this. It's going to have that there and it's going to have that right there. How does that compare to a12? So a12 is if you crossed out this and this, you're left 1with all of this right here. 1So once again, you see that this row is the same thing as 1this column, that this row is the same thing as this column, 1that that row is the same thing as that column. 1So once again, the submatrix we have to take the 1determit of is equal to the transpose of 1this thing over here. 1So it's equal to a12 transpose. 1This thing-- I could draw it shaded in-- is equal to the 1transpose of this thing, is equal to the transpose of that 1thing right there. 1So, in general, each of these submatrices when we go down 1this row is equal to the transpose of each of these. 1So you keep going, so then you're going to go all the way 1to plus minus 1. 1We're going to go all the way down to the minus 1, 1 plus m 1times the determit of-- it's going to be this guy 1transposed. 1You can even do it. 1If you go all the way to-- if you cross that guy out and 1that guy out, you're left with everything else on this 1matrix, and that's equal to the transpose of if you cross 1this guy out and that guy out. 1This row turns into that column, that row turns into 1that column. 1I think you see the point. 1I don't want to beat a dead horse. 1So that's going to be equal to a sub 1m transpose. 1Now, remember, going into this inductive proof, or proof by 1induction, I assume that for-- remember, this is an n plus 1 1by n plus 1 matrix. 1But going into it, I assumed that for an n-by-n matrix, the 1determit of B is equal to the 1determit of B transpose. 1Well, these guys right here, these are 1n-by-n matrices, right? 1This guy right here is an n plus 1 by n plus 1. 1Same thing for this guy right here. 1But these guys right here are n by n. 1So if we assume for the n-by-n case that the determit of a 1matrix is equal to the determit of a transpose-- 1this is the determit of the matrix, this is the 1determit of its transpose-- these two 1things have to be equal. 1So we can then say that the determit of A transpose is 1equal to this term A sub 11 times this, but this is equal 1to this for the n-by-n case. 1Remember, we're doing the n plus 1 by n plus 1 case. 1But these submatrices are one dimension 1smaller in each direction. 1It has one less row and one less column. 1So these two things are equal. 1So instead of writing this, I can just write this, so times 1the determit of a sub 11. 1Then you keep going. 1Minus a sub 12 times the determit. 1Instead of writing this, I could write that because 1they're equal. 1Determit a sub 12, all the way to plus minus 1 to the 1 1plus m times the determit of this. 1These two things are equal. 1That is equal to that. 1That was our assumption in this inductive 1proof, a sub 1m. 1And then you see that, of course, this line, this blue 1line here, is equivalent to this blue line there. 1So we get that the determit of A, which is an n plus 1 by 1n plus 1, so this is the n plus 1 by n plus 1 case. 1We get the determit of A is equal to the 1determit of A transpose. 1And we got this assuming that it is true-- let me write it-- 1assuming that it's true for n-by-n case. 1And then we're done. 1We've now proved that this is true in general, because we've 1proven the base case. 1We've proven it for the 2-by-2 case, and then we showed that 1if it's true for the n case, it's true for 1the n plus 1 case. 1So if it's true for the 2 case, it's going to be true 1for the 3-by-3 case. 1If it's true for the 3-by-3 case, it's true for the 4-by-4 1case, so on and so forth. 1But the takeaway is pretty neat. 1You can take the transpose, the 1determit doesn't change.",math_linear-algebra_matrix-transformations
" - This proton on ethanol has a pKa value of approximately 16, while this proton on acetic acid has a pKa value of approximately five. Remember, the lower the value for your pKa, the more acidic the proton. So with the lower pKa value, acetic acid is more acid than ethanol. We can explain why by looking at the conjugate bases. If ethanol donates this proton, the electrons in this bond, the electrons in magenta are left behind on the oxygen. So let's draw in the conjugate base. This oxygen would have three lone pairs of electrons, and one of those lone pairs would be the electrons in magenta. That gives this oxygen a negative one formal charge. Let's draw the conjugate base for acetic acid. If acetic acid donates this proton, then the electrons in magenta are left behind on the oxygen, so the conjugate base would have a carbon double bonded to an oxygen here with two lone pairs of electrons. And then on the right we would have another oxygen, this one with three lone pairs, one of those lone pairs would be the electrons in magenta. So that gives this oxygen a negative one formal charge. Let's compare our two conjugate bases. Both of them have a negative charge an oxygen, so there must be some other factor to stabilize a conjugate base, and that factor is resoce. So for the conjugate base on the right, we can take those electrons in magenta, we can take these electrons here and we can move them in, and then we can kick off these electrons on to the top oxygen. So let's draw the resulting resoce structure. So we would have for our top oxygen we would now have three lone pairs of electrons around the top oxygen, giving that top oxygen a negative one formal charge. This oxygen would now have only two lone pairs of electrons around it, and the electrons in magenta move into here. And these pi electrons, let me make them blue, moved off onto the top oxygen to give the top oxygen a negative one formal charge. So the negative charge on this oxygen is not localized to this one oxygen, it's spread out, it's delocalized. So there's actually some negative charge on this oxygen too. So remember, resoce structures are not perfect. In reality, it's really a hybrid of our two resoce structures. So the negative charge is spread out or delocaliazed over two oxygens, and when you spread out a negative charge, that has a stabilizing effect for the anion. So our conjugate base is stabilized by resoce, and since our conjugate base is stabilized by resoce, that means acetic acid is more likely to donate to this proton, and that's why we see a lower pKa value. If we compare that to the conjugate base for ethanol, alright this is called the ethoxide anion, alright we can't draw a resoce structure, we can't delocalize that negative charge. That negative charge is stuck on this one oxygen here, and that means this conjugate base is not as stable, it's not stabilized by resoce. So that means ethanol is not as likely to donate its proton, and that's why we see a higher pKa value for ethanol. So when you're trying to figure out a more acidic proton, draw the conjugate base and look for resoce. Here we have an organic compound, and our goal is to determine which is the more acidic proton. Is this the more acidic proton? Or is this the more acidic proton? So let's say a base comes along and takes this top proton here. Well the electrons in this bond in magenta will be left behind on this carbon I just circled in magenta, so let's draw that conjugate base. We would have our ring, we would have this carbon double bonded to this oxygen, this oxygen has two lone pairs of electrons on it, and the electrons in magenta would remain on this carbon right here in magenta which gives that carbon a negative one formal charge. Don't forget that carbon in magenta also has another hydrogen bonded to it, but I'm not drawing it in on the conjugate base just to make things easier to see. Let's say a base comes along and takes this proton. So that would mean the electrons in dark blue would remain behind on this carbon in dark blue that I just circled, so let's draw that conjugate base. So let me draw in our ring here, and then this oxygen would have two lone pairs of electrons on it. The electrons in dark blue would end up on this carbon in dark blue which gives that carbon in dark blue a negative one formal charge. Let me draw that in. Again remember, this carbon also has a hydrogen bonded to it, but I'm not gonna draw it in on the conjugate base because it makes it easier for us to see. Which of those two conjugate bases is the most stable? Well the top conjugate base is stabilized by resoce, you could take these electrons in magenta and you could move them in to form a double bond. Let's go ahead and show that, the electrons in magenta moving here, now we kick these electrons off on to the oxygen, so we would have now... When we draw our ring we'd have a double bond here, and this oxygen would have three lone pairs of electrons around it, giving it a negative one formal charge. So the electrons in magenta moved into here, and the electrons in, let's make these light blue, electrons in light blue moved off onto the oxygen to give the oxygen a negative one formal charge. Now remember, oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, and so this oxygen here is better able to bear this negative charge, than this carbon in magenta over here. So this on the right, this resoce structure actually contributes more to the overall hybrids, but our conjugate base is stabilized by resoce. That's in contrast to this conjugate base down here. We have a negative charge on this carbon, but that negative charge is localized to that carbon in dark blue right here. We can't draw any resoce, we can't show any resoce stabilization. Which means that this conjugate base is not as stable as what we drew up here, which did have some resoce stabilization. And that means that we found our answer, the more acidic proton is the one that has the conjugate base that's resoce stabilized. So this proton that's next door to this carbon double bonded to the oxygen that's on a carbon that's next door to this carbon doubled to the oxygen, that is the acidic proton. And this is something that will come up later in the course, it's very important to understand.",science_organic-chemistry_organic-structures
" -  We're told that f of x is equal to one over the square root of x plus one, and what we want to figure out is what is the second degree Maclaurin polynomial of f? And like always, pause this video and see if you could have a go at it. so let's remind ourselves what a Maclaurin polynomial is, a Maclaurin polynomial is just a Taylor polynomial centered at zero, so the form of this second degree Maclaurin polynomial, and we just have to find this Maclaurin expansion until our second degree term, it's going to look like this. So p of x, I'm using p for polynomial, it's going to be our f of zero plus, and we could do that as f of zero times x to the zero power, well, that's just f of zero. F of zero plus f prime of zero x, plus f prime prime of zero, divided by, we could think of it as two factorial, but it's really just two, we could think of this as dividing by one factorial, which is just one, this dividing by zero factorial, well that's just one again, so we have f prime prime of zero, the second derivative evaluated zero divided by two, x squared. Now if we wanted a higher degree we could keep on going, but remember, they're just asking us for the second degree. So this is the form that we're gonna need, we're gonna have these three terms. So let's see if we can evaluate the function and its derivatives at zero. So f of zero, f of zero is equal to one over the square root of zero plus one, well that's one over the square root of one, the principle root of one, which is positive one, so that's just going to be equal to one. So that right over there is equal to one. Now let's evaluate f prime of x, and then I'll evaluate f prime of zero. F prime of x is equal to, well, one over the square root of x plus one, this is the same thing as x plus one, let me write it this way, this is the same thing as, actually let me write it down this way. Another way of writing f of x is this is the same thing as x plus one to the negative one half. And so if I'm thinking the first derivative of f, well, I could use the chain rule here, the derivative of x plus one with respect to x, well, that's just going to be one, and then I'll take the derivative of this whole thing with respect to x plus one and I'll just use the power rule there, this is gonna be negative one half, times x plus one, to the, and I decrement the exponent, negative three halves. And so the first derivative evaluated of zero is just negative one half, times, if this is zero, zero plus one is just one, one to the negative three halves, one to the negative three half power, well, that's just going to be one. So this whole thing, f prime of zero is just negative one half. So that is this right over here is negative one half. And now let's figure out the second derivative. All right, let me do this in this green color. So the second derivative with respect to x, well I did the same thing again, the derivative of x plus one with respect to x, that's just one, so I just have to take the derivative of the whole thing with respect to x plus one. So I take my exponent, bring it out front, negative three halves times one half, times negative one half, is going to be positive three fourths times x plus one, and then I decrement the exponent here by one, or by two halves, so that's gonna be negative five halves, and so the second derivative evaluated at zero, well if this is equal to zero you're gonna have one to the negative five halves which is just one, times three fourths, is gonna be three fourths. So this part right over here is three fourths. And so you're gonna have three fourths divided by two, three fourths divided by two is three eighths. So our Taylor, I should say, our Maclaurin polynomial, our second degree Maclaurin polynomial, p of x is going to be equal to, and I'll do it in the same colors, going to be equal to one, plus, maybe I'll just write it as minus one half, minus one half x, plus three eighths x squared, plus three eighths x squared, and we are done, there you have it. We have our second degree Maclaurin polynomial of f, which could be used to provide an approximation for our function, especially if our x is near zero.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-series-new
" Rewrite the following equation in logarithmic form. So they wrote 100 is equal to 10 to the second power. So if we wanna write the same information, really, in logarithmic form, we could say that the power that I need to raise 10 to to get to 100 is equal to 2, or log base 10 of 100 is equal to 2. Notice these are equivalent statements. This is just in exponential form. This is is logarithmic form. This is saying that the power I need to raise 10 to to get to 100 is equal to 2. Which is the same thing as saying that 10 to the 2nd power is 100. 10 to the second power is 100. And the way that I specify the base is by doing this underscore right over here. So underscore 10, log base 10 of 100 is equal to 2. Here they ask us to rewrite the following equation in exponential form. So this is log base 5 of 1 over 125 is equal to negative 3. This is one way to think about it is saying the power that I need to raise 5 to to get to 1 over 125 is equal to negative 3 or that 5 to the negative 3 power is equal to 1 over 125. And we can verify that this has formatted it the right way. 5 to the negative 3 power is 1 over 125. The exact same truth about the universe, just in different forms. Logarithmic form and exponential form. So let me check my answer and make sure I got it right. And I did.",math_algebra2_logs
" Let's apply what we learned in the last video into a concrete example of the work done by a vector field on something going through some type of path through the field. So let's say that I have a vector field. It's defined over r2 for the x-y plane. So it's a function of x and y. It associates a vector with every point on the plane. And let's say my vector field is y times the unit vector i minus x times the unit vector j. And so you can imagine if we were to draw-- let's draw our x- and y-axes. I'll do it over here. If we were to draw our x- and y-axes, this associates a vector, a force vector-- let's say this is actually a force vector-- with every point in our x-y plane. So this is x and this is y. So if we're at the point, for example, 1, 0, what will the vector look like that's associated with that point? Well, at 1, 0, y is 0, so this will be 0, i minus 1, j. Minus 1, j looks like this. So minus 1, j will look like that. At x is equal to 2-- I'm just picking points at random, ones that'll be -- y is still 0, and now the force vector here would be minus 2, j. So it would look something like this. Minus 2, j. Something like that. Likewise, if we were to go here, where y is equal to 1 and x is equal to is 0, when y is equal to 1, we have 1, i minus 0, j, so then our vector is going to look like that at this point. If we're to go to 2-- you could get the picture. You can keep plotting these points. You just want to get a sense of what it looks like. If you go here, the vector's going to look like that. If you go maybe at this point right here, the vector's going to look like that. I think you get the general idea. I could keep filling in the space for this entire field all over. You know, just to make it symmetric, if I was here, the vector is going to look like that. You get the idea. I could just fill in all of the points if I had to. Now, in that field, I have some particle moving, and let's say its path is described by the curve c, and the parameterization of it is x of t is equal to cosine of t, and y of t is equal to sine of t. And the path will occur from t-- let's say, 0 is less than or equal to t is less than or equal to 2pi. You might already recognize what this would be. This parameterization is essentially a counterclockwise circle. So the path that this guy is going to go is going to start here. Well, you can imagine, t in this case, you could almost imagine is just the angle of the circle, but you can also imagine t is time. So at time equals 0, we're going to be over here. Then at time of pi over 2, we're going to have traveled a quarter of the circle to there, so we're moving in that direction. And then at time after pi seconds, we would have gotten right there. And then all the way after 2pi seconds, we would have gotten all the way around the circle. So our path, our curve, is one counterclockwise rotation around the circle, so to speak. So what is the work done by this field on this curve? So the work done. So the work, we learned in the previous video, is equal to the line integral over this contour of our field, of our vector field, dotted with the differential of our movement, so dotted with the differential of our movement dr. Well, I haven't even defined r yet. I mean, I kind of have just the parameterization here, so we need to have a vector function. We need to have some r that defines this path. This is just a standard parameterization, but if I wanted to write it as a vector function of t, we would write that r of t is equal to x of t, which is cosine of t times i plus y of t times j, which is just sine of t times j. And likewise, this is for 0 is less than or equal to t, which is less than or equal to 2pi. And this are equivalent. The reason why I took the pain of doing this is so now I can take its vector function derivative, and can figure out its differential, and then I can actually take the dot product with this thing over here. So let's do all of that and actually calculate this line integral and figure out the work done by this field. One thing might already pop in your mind. We're going in a counterclockwise direction, but at every point where we're passing through, it looks like the field is going exactly opposite the direction of our motion. For example, here we're moving upwards. The field is pulling us backwards. Here we're moving to the top left. The field is moving us to the bottom right. Here we're moving exactly to the left. The field is pulling us to the right. So it looks like the field is always doing the exact opposite of what we're trying to do. It's hindering our ability to move. So I'll give you a little intuition. This'll probably deal with negative work. For example, if I lift something off the ground, I have to apply force to fight gravity. I'm doing positive work, but gravity's doing negative work on that. We're just going to do the math here just to make you comfortable with this idea, but it's interesting to think about what's exactly going on even here. The field is-- the field I'm doing in that pink color, so let me stick to that. The field is pushing in that direction, so it's always going opposite the motion. But let's just do the math to make everything in the last video a little bit more concrete. So a good place to start is the derivative of our position vector function with respect to t. So we have a dr/dt, which we could also write as r prime of t. This is equal to the derivative of x of t with respect to t, which is minus sine of t times i plus the derivative of y of t with respect to t. Derivative of sine of t is just cosine of t. Cosine of t times j. And if we want the differential, we just multiply everything times dt, so we get to dr is equal to-- we could write it this way. We could actually even just put the d-- well, let me just do it. So it's minus sine of t dt-- I'm just multiplying each of these terms by dt, distributive property-- times the unit vector i plus cosine of t dt times the unit vector j. So we have this piece now. And now we want to take the dot product with this over here, but let me rewrite our vector field in terms of in terms of t, so to speak. So what's our field going to be doing at any point t? We don't have to worry about every point. We don't have to worry, for example, that over here the vector field is going to be doing something like that because that's not on our path. That force never had an impact on the particle. We only care about what happens along our path. So we can find a function that we can essentially substitute y and x for, their relative functions with respect to t, and then we'll have the force from the field at any point or any time t. So let's do that. So this guy right here, if I were to write it as a function of t, this is going to be equal to y of t, right? y is a function of t, so it's sine of t, right? that's that. Sine of t times i plus-- or actually minus x, or x of t. x is a function of t. So minus cosine of t times j. And now all of it seems a little bit more straightforward. If we want to find this line integral, this line integral is going to be the same thing as the integral-- let me pick a nice, soothing color. Maybe this is a nice one. The integral from t is equal to 0 to t is equal to 2pi of f dot dr. Now, when you take the dot product, you just multiply the corresponding components, and add it up. So we take the product of the minus sign and the sine of t-- or the sine of t with the minus sine of t dt, I get-- you're going to get minus sine squared t dt, and then you're going to add that to-- so you're going to have that plus. Let me write that dt a little bit. That was a wacky-looking dt. dt, and then you're going to have that plus these two guys multiplied by each other. So that's-- well, there's a minus to sign here so plus. Let me just change this to a minus. Minus cosine squared dt. And if we factor out a minus sign and a dt, what is this going to be equal to? This is going to be equal to the integral from 0 to 2pi of, we could say, sine squared plus-- I want to put the t -- sine squared of t plus cosine squared of t. And actually, let me take the minus sign out to the front. So if we just factor the minus sign, and put a minus there, make this a plus. So the minus sign out there, and then we factor dt out. I did a couple of steps in there, but I think you got it. Now this is just algebra at this point. Factoring out a minus sign, so this becomes positive. And then you have a dt and a dt. Factor that out, and you get this. 1You could multiply this out and you'd get what we 1originally have, if that confuses you at all. 1And the reason why I did that: we know what sine squared of 1anything plus cosine squared of that same anything is. 1That falls right out of the unit circle definition of 1our trig function, so this is just 1. 1So our whole integral has been reduced to the minus integral 1from 0 to 2pi of dt. 1And this is-- we have seen this before. 1We can probably say that this is of 1, if you want to 1put something there. 1Then the antiderivative of 1 is just-- so this is just going to 1be equal to minus-- and that minus sign is just the same 1minus sign that we're carrying forward. 1The antiderivative of 1 is just t, and we're going to evaluate 1it from 2pi to 0, or from 0 to 2pi, so this is equal to 1minus-- that minus sign right there-- 2pi minus t 1at 0, so minus 0. 1So this is just equal to minus 2pi. 1And there you have it. 1We figured out the work that this field did on the particle, 1or whatever, whatever thing was moving around in this 1counterclockwise fashion. 1And our intuition held up. 1We actually got a negative number for the work done. 1And that's because, at all times, the field was actually 1going exactly opposite, or was actually opposing, the movement 1of, if we think of it as a particle in its 1counterclockwise direction. 1Anyway, hopefully, you found that helpful.",math_multivariable-calculus_integrating-multivariable-functions

And so if you did this experiment, you might see something like this rectangle up here so all of these different colors of the rainbow and I'm gonna call this a continuous spectrum. It's continuous because you see all these colors right next to each other. So they kind of blend together. So that's a continuous spectrum If you did this similar thing with hydrogen, you don't see a continuous spectrum. So, if you passed a current through a tube containing hydrogen gas, the electrons in the hydrogen atoms are going to absorb energy and jump up to a higher energy level. When those electrons fall down to a lower energy level they emit light and so we talked about this in the last video. This is the concept of emission. If you use something like a prism or diffraction grating to separate out the light, for hydrogen, you don't get a continuous spectrum. You'd see these four lines of color. So, since you see lines, we call this a line spectrum. So this is the line spectrum for hydrogen. So you see one red line and it turns out that that red line has a wave length. That red light has a wave length of 656 ometers. You'll also see a blue green line and so this has a wave length of 486 ometers. A blue line, 434 ometers, and a violet line at 410 ometers. And so this emission spectrum is unique to hydrogen and so this is one way to identify elements. And so this is a pretty important thing. And since line spectrum are unique, this is pretty important to explain where those wavelengths come from. And we can do that by using the equation we derived in the previous video. So I call this equation the Balmer Rydberg equation. And you can see that one over lamda, lamda is the wavelength of light that's emitted, is equal to R, which is the Rydberg constant, times one over I squared, where I is talking about the lower energy level, minus one over J squared, where J is referring to the higher energy level. For example, let's say we were considering an excited electron that's falling from a higher energy level n is equal to three. So let me write this here. So we have an electron that's falling from n is equal to three down to a lower energy level, n is equal to two. All right, so it's going to emit light when it undergoes that transition. So let's look at a visual representation of this. Now let's see if we can calculate the wavelength of light that's emitted. All right, so if an electron is falling from n is equal to three to n is equal to two, I'm gonna go ahead and draw an electron here. So an electron is falling from n is equal to three energy level down to n is equal to two, and the difference in those two energy levels are that difference in energy is equal to the energy of the photon. And so that's how we calculated the Balmer Rydberg equation in the previous video. All right, let's go ahead and calculate the wavelength of light that's emitted when the electron falls from the third energy level to the second. So, we have one over lamda is equal to the Rydberg constant, as we saw in the previous video, is one point zero nine seven times ten to the seventh. The units would be one over meter, all right? One over I squared. So, I refers to the lower energy level, all right? So the lower energy level is when n is equal to two. So we plug in one over two squared. And then, from that, we're going to subtract one over the higher energy level. That's n is equal to three, right? So this would be one over three squared. So one over two squared minus one over three squared. Let's go ahead and get out the calculator and let's do that math. So one over two squared, that's one fourth, so that's point two five, minus one over three squared, so that's one over nine. So, one fourth minus one ninth gives us point one three eight repeating. And if we multiply that number by the Rydberg constant, right, that's one point zero nine seven times ten to the seventh, we get one five two three six one one. So let me go ahead and write that down. So now we have one over lamda is equal to one five two three six one one. So to solve for lamda, all we need to do is take one over that number. So one over that number gives us six point five six times ten to the negative seven and that would now be in meters. So we have lamda is equal to six point five six times ten to the negative seventh meters. So let's convert that into, let's go like this, let's go 656, that's the same thing as 656 times ten to the negative ninth meters. And so that's 656 ometers. 656 ometers, and that should sound familiar to you. All right, so let's go back up here and see where we've seen 656 ometers before. 656 ometers is the wavelength of this red line right here. So, that red line represents the light that's emitted when an electron falls from the third energy level down to the second energy level. So let's go back down to here and let's go ahead and show that. So we can say that a photon, right, a photon of red light is given off as the electron falls from the third energy level to the second energy level. So that explains the red line in the line spectrum of hydrogen. So how can we explain these other lines that we see, right? So we have these other lines over here, right? We have this blue green one, this blue one, and this violet one. So if you do the math, you can use the Balmer Rydberg equation or you can do this and you can plug in some more numbers and you can calculate those values. So those are electrons falling from higher energy levels down to the second energy level. So let's go ahead and draw them on our diagram, here. So, let's say an electron fell from the fourth energy level down to the second. All right, so that energy difference, if you do the calculation, that turns out to be the blue green line in your line spectrum. So, I'll represent the light emitted like that. And if an electron fell from the fifth energy level down to the second energy level, that corresponds to the blue line that you see on the line spectrum. And then, finally, the violet line must be the transition from the sixth energy level down to the second, so let's go ahead and draw that in. And so now we have a way of explaining this line spectrum of hydrogen that we can observe. And since we calculated this Balmer Rydberg equation using the Bohr equation, using the Bohr model, I should say, the Bohr model is what allowed us to do this. So the Bohr model explains these different energy levels that we see. So when you look at the line spectrum of hydrogen, it's kind of like you're seeing energy levels. At least that's how I like to think about it 'cause you're, it's the only real way you can see the difference of energy. All right, so energy is quantized. We call this the Balmer series. So this is called the Balmer series for hydrogen. But there are different transitions that you could do. For example, let's think about an electron going from the second energy level to the first. All right, so let's get some more room here If I drew a line here, again, not drawn to scale. Think about an electron going from the second energy level down to the first. So from n is equal to two to n is equal to one. Let's use our equation and let's calculate that wavelength next. So this would be one over lamda is equal to the Rydberg constant, one point zero nine seven times ten to the seventh, that's one over meters, and then we're going from the second energy level to the first, so this would be one over the lower energy level squared so n is equal to one squared minus one over two squared. All right, so let's get some more room, get out the calculator here. So, one over one squared is just one, minus one fourth, so that's point seven five and so if we take point seven five of the Rydberg constant, let's go ahead and do that. So one point zero nine seven times ten to the seventh is our Rydberg constant. Then multiply that by point seven five, right? So three fourths, then we should get that number there. So that's eight two two seven five zero zero. So let's write that down. One over the wavelength is equal to eight two two seven five zero. So to solve for that wavelength, just take one divided by that number and that gives you one point two one times ten to the negative seven and that'd be in meters. So the wavelength here is equal to one point, let me see what that was again. One point two one five. One point two one five times ten to the negative seventh meters. And so if you move this over two, right, that's 122 ometers. So this is 122 ometers, but this 1is not a wavelength that we can see. 1So 122 ometers, right, that falls into 1the UV region, the ultraviolet region, 1so we can't see that. 1We can see the ones in the visible spectrum only. 1And so this will represent a line in a different series 1and you can use the Balmer Rydberg equation 1to calculate all the other possible 1transitions for hydrogen and 1that's beyond the scope of this video. 1So, here, I just wanted to show you that 1the emission spectrum of hydrogen 1can be explained using the Balmer Rydberg equation 1which we derived using the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom. 1So even thought the Bohr model of the hydrogen 1atom is not reality, it does allow us to figure 1some things out and to realize that energy is quantized.",science_physics_quantum-physics
" - [Tutor] What we're going to do in this video is see if we can solve the differential equation, the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to x times y, pause this video and see if you can find a general solution here. So the first thing that my brain likes to do, when I see a differential equation is to say, hey, is this separable and when I say separable, can I get all the ys and dys on one side and all the xs and dxs on the other side? And you can indeed do that, if we treat our differentials like, if we could treat 'em like algebraic variables, which is fair game, when you're dealing with differential equations like this, we could multiple both sides by dx, so multiple both sides by dx and we could divide both sides by y, let me move this over a little bit, so we have some space, so we could also multiple both sides by one over y, one over y and so what that does is these dxs cancel out and this y and one over y cancels out and we are left with, let me write all the things in terms of y on the left-hand side in blue, so we have one over you dy is equal to, and then I'll do all this stuff in orange, we have is equal to, we're just left with an x and a dx, x dx and then we'll wanna take the indefinite integral of both sides, now what's the anti-derivative of one over y? Well, if we want it in the most general form, this would be the natural log of the absolute value of y and then this is going to be equal to the anti-derivative of x is x squared over two and then we wanna put a constant on either side, I'll just put it on the right-hand side, plus C, this ensures that we're dealing with the general solution, now if we wanna solve explicitly for y, we could raise e to both sides' power, another way to think about it is, if this is equal to that, then e to this power is going to be the same thing as e to that power, now, what does that do for us? Well, what is e to the natural log of the absolute value of y? Well, I'm raising e to the power that I would have to raise e too to to get to the absolute value of y, so the left-hand side here, it simplifies to the absolute value of y and we get that as being equal to, now, we could use our exponent properties, this over here is the same thing as e to the x squared over two times e to the C times e to the C, I am just using our exponent properties here, well, e to the C, we could just view that as some other type of constant, this is just sum constant C, so we could rewrite this whole thing as C e to the x squared x squared over two, hopefully you see what I'm doing there, I just use my exponent properties e dah dah dah, sum of two things is equal to e to the first thing times e to the second thing and I just said, well, e to the power of sum constant C, we could just relabel that as, let's call that our blue C and so this simplifies to blue C times e to the x squared over two, now we saw this absolute value sign here, so this essentially means that y could be equal to, we could write it this way, y could be equal to plus or minus C, C e to the x squared over two, x squared over two, but once again, we don't know what this constant is, I didn't say that it was positive or negative, so when you see a plus or minus of a constant here, you could really just subsume all of this, I'll just call this red C, so we could say that y is equal to, I'll just rewrite it over again for fun, y is equal to red C, not the Red Sea, but a red C (laughs) times e to the x squared over two, this right over here, it's the general solution to the original, separable differential equation.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-diff-equations
" Let's graph another rational function, because you really can't get enough practice here. So let's say we have y is equal to x over x squared minus x minus 6. So the first thing we might want to do is just factor this denominator so we can identify our vertical asymptotes, if there are any. So what two numbers when I take their product I get negative 6 and if I add them up I get negative 1? So they have to be of different signs. So one's going to be a plus and one-- let me write my x's a little bit neater than that-- so one is going to be a positive and one is going to be a negative. A 2 and a 3 seem to be pretty close, because they're one apart, and I'm going to subtract the larger number because when I add them, I get a negative. So x minus 3 times x plus 2 seems to work. That gets negative 6. Negative 3x plus 2x. negative 3 times x plus 2 times x is negative x, so that works. So this is equal to x over x plus 2 times x minus 3. And like we saw in the last video, since these expressions, since the x plus 2 doesn't cancel out with anything in the numerator and the x minus 3 doesn't cancel out with anything in the numerator, we know that these can be used to find our vertical asymptotes. The vertical asymptotes are when either that term is equal to zero or when that term is equal to zero, because at those points, our equation is undefined. So this is equal to zero when x is equal to negative 2, and this is equal to zero when x is equal to positive 3. And you could try it out here. If x is equal to negative 2 or positive 3, you're going to get a zero in the denonminator, y will be undefined. So vertical asymptotes at x is equal to negative 2. So there's a vertical asymptote, a vertical asymptote right there. Another vertical asymptote is x is equal to 3. One, two, three. There is our other vertical asymptote. Now let's think about horizontal asymptotes, or if there are any. So what happens as x gets super-positive or super-negative? And as we said before, you just have to look at the highest degree term on the numerator and the highest degree term on the denominator. Now, notice the highest degree term on the denominator is x squared, while the highest degree term on the numerator is only an x. So when x gets really large, what's going to happen? You could imagine, this is going to be like a million over a million squared, which is still one over a million. These terms over here don't matter much. But this term right here is going to grow faster than everything. This is an x squared term. As x gets large, it's going to get way larger than everything, including this term on the top, so it's essentially going to go to zero. When the denominator just gets bigger, faster than the numerator as you're going to approach zero. So we have a horizontal asymptote at y is equal to 0. I could draw it as a dotted line over our x-axis. So that right there is the line, y is equal to 0. Once again, we identify that looking at the highest degree term there. The denominator has a higher-degree term, so it's going to grow faster than the numerator. You could try it out on your calculator. And that's true whether you go in the super-negative direction or the super-positive direction. This thing is going to overwhelm this thing up here, the denominator grows faster than the numerator, which essentially we're going to approach zero. You're going to get smaller and smaller fractions. Just remember, 1/10 and then-- let me actually just-- as x gets larger and larger and larger, what's going to happen? Let me just show you on my calculator. Let's say x is equal to 10. 10 divided by 10 squared minus 10, and normally you wouldn't have to do this. I just really want to show you the intuition. Whoops! I'm not trying to graph. Let me exit from here. So if we have 10 over 10 squared minus 10, once again, you normally wouldn't have to do this. I just want to show you, give you the intuition. Let me put some parentheses there. Let me put some parentheses over here. So let me insert the parentheses there and put a parentheses over here. You get a small number. What happens if x gets even larger? Let me make, instead of a 10, let me make it all 100. Let me make these tens into hundreds, into 100. Insert 100 there, what do we get? We get even a smaller number. And if you try x is equal to 1,000, it's going to be be even smaller than that. That's because this term right here is growing faster than every single other term. That's why our horizontal asymptote is y is equal to 0. Now, the last thing we want to do, we've drawn all of our asymptotes, is just try out some points. So let's draw like a little table here. There's our table. When x is equal to 0, what is y? x is 0, we have 0 over all of this. 0 minus 6, 0 over negative 6 is just 0. When x is equal to-- I don't know, let's just try when x is equal to 1, what do we have? We have 1 over-- I'll write it here. 1 over 1 squared minus 1. Now that's just 0, so we have negative 6. When x is equal to negative 1, what do we have? When x is equal to negative 1, we have negative 1 over negative 1 squared, which is 1 minus negative 1. So that's plus 1-- right, minus negative 1-- minus 6. So what is this right here? This is negative 1, so this is going to be negative 1 over 2 minus 6 over negative 4. This is going to be equal to 1/4, so we're going to get a positive value. So we have-- let me draw this-- negative 1, we're at 1/4 right here. That's about right there. I'll do it in a darker color. We had the point 0, 0, and then at x is equal to 1, we had negative 1/6. So you could keep graphing more and more points, but it looks like as we approach this vertical asymptote from the right, we go to positive infinity. And that should make sense. Let's see, if we were to put in-- we're approaching negative 2 from the right. So if you were to put in negative 1.9999999, this term is going to be a very small positive number. This term's going to be a negative number. This term's going to be negative number. The negatives cancel out. You have a very small positive number in the denominator. 1 over that gives you a very positive number. Now, as we approach the other vertical asymptote from the left, we're going to go super-negative. My gut tells me that because when I tried x is equal to 1, I already went to a negative value. But you could imagine if you did 2.99999, right? Let me draw that a little bit better. You get the idea. If x is equal to 2.999, so we get really close to the asymptote, this is going to be positive, this is going to be negative, that's going to be positive, and this is going to be a small number. So you're going to have 1 over a very small negative number, which is a very, I guess, negative number. It's a negative of 1 over a very small number, so you're going to approach negative infinity. Now, let's try some point out here to see what happens. So what happens when x is equal to 4? When x is equal to 4, you have 4 over 16 minus 4 minus 6. What is that? That's 16 minus 10. That is 6. So this is equal to 4/6, which is equal to 2/3. So the point 4, 2/3 is here, so one, two, three, four. 2/3, just like that. So that gives me the sense, look, I have to approach this horizontal asymptote as we go further and further out. We're going to probably approach positive infinity like this. Let me draw it a little neater than that. Like that. You get the idea. Then over here, we're going to get closer and closer to our horizontal asymptote as we approach infinity. This should be a smoother-looking curve right around there. I'm making a mess here. This should be a smoother-looking curve. You get the idea, I think. Now, let's see what happens when x is equal to negative 3. So when x is equal to negative 3, we have negative 3 over negative 3 squared, which is 9 minus negative 3, so that's plus 3 minus 6. So what is this equal to? This is equal to negative 3 over-- this is 12 minus 6 over 6, right, which is equal to negative 1/2, So negative 3, negative 1/2. Negative 1/2 is right there. So we're going to approach this asymptote as we get 1really negative. 1And we're probably going to go straight down like that as we 1approach this vertical asymptote right there. 1And you could try more points if you don't believe me. 1But let us graph it just to verify it for ourselves. 1So our equation is x divided by x squared minus x minus 6. 1And let's graph it. 1And there you go. 1There you go. 1All right, looks pretty good. 1Our asymptote is zero, we go down. 1Vertical asymptote, bam! 1Go up there, then we go back down here, then we go just 1like that again. 1So once again, this looks just about exactly what we got. 1Obviously, the graphing calculator, it kind of a 1pitters out as you get close to these values and it does 1weird things, but it has the same general shape. 1We could actually close the range a little bit if we want, 1if we want to graph it. 1Let's make our x minimum value, let's make it 5. 1And let's take our x maximum value, let's 1make that 5 as well. 1We're kind of zooming in a little bit. 1So let's graph it now. 1Bam! 1bam! 1There you go! 1It's the same shape as we graphed right here. 1Hopefully, you found that satisfying.",math_algebra2_rational
" Let's write an arithmetic sequence in general terms. So we can start with some number a. And then we can keep adding d to it. And that number that we keep adding, which could be a positive or a negative number, we call our common difference. So the second term in our sequence will be a plus d. The third term in our sequence will be a plus 2d. So we keep adding d all the way to the n-th term in our sequence. And you already see here that in our first term, we added d zero times. Our second term, we added d once. In our third term, we added d twice. So you see, whatever the index of the term is, we're adding d one less than that many times. So if we go all the way to the n-th term, we're going to add d one less than n times. So it's going to be n minus 1 times d. Fair enough. And let me write that. This right over here is our n-th term. Now what I want to do is think about what the sum of this arithmetic sequence would be. And the sum of an arithmetic sequence we call an arithmetic series. So let me write that in yellow. Color changing is sometimes difficult. So the arithmetic series is just the sum of an arithmetic sequence. So let's call my arithmetic series s sub n. And let's say it's going to be the sum of these terms, so it's going to be a plus d, plus a plus 2d, plus all the way to adding the n-th term, which is a plus n minus 1 times d. Now I'm going to do the same trick that I did when I did the most basic arithmetic sequence. I'm going to add this to itself, but I'm going to swap the order in which I write this sum. So s sub n I can write as this, but I'm going to write it in reverse order. I'm going to write the last term first. So the n-th term is a plus n minus 1 times d. Then the second to last term is going to be a plus n minus 2 times d. The third to last is going to be a plus n minus 3 times d. And we're going to go all the way down to the first term, which is just a. Now let's add these two equations. We are going to get, on the left hand side, s sub n plus s sub n. You're going to get 2 times s sub n. Well, what's the sum of these two first terms right over here? I'm going to have a plus a plus n minus 1 times d. So it's going to be 2a plus n minus 1 times d. Now let's add both of these second terms. So if I were to add both of these second terms, what do I get it? I'm going to get 2a plus 2a. And what's d plus n minus 2 times d? So you could view it several ways. Let me write this over here. What is d plus n minus 2 times d? Well, this is just the same thing as 1d plus n minus 2 times d. And so you could just add the coefficients. So this is going to be n minus 2 plus 1 times d, which is equal to n minus 1 times d. So the second term also becomes 2a plus n minus 1 times d. Now let's add the third term. I'll do it in green. The third terms, I should say. And I think you're going to see a pattern here. It's 2a plus 2a. And if I have 2 plus n minus 3 of something and then I add 2, I'm going to have n minus one of that something. So plus n minus 1 times d. And you're going to keep doing that all the way until your n-th pair of terms, all the way until you add these two characters over here, which is just 2a plus n minus 1 times d. So you have this 2a plus n minus 1 d being added over and over again. And how many times are you doing that? Well, you had n pairs of terms when you were adding these two equations. In each of them, you had n terms. This is the first term, this is the second term, this is the third term, all the way to the n-th term. So I can rewrite 2 times the sum 2 times s sub n is going to be n times this quantity. It's going to be n times 2a plus n minus 1 times d. And then if we want to solve for s sub n, you just divide both sides by 2. And you get s sub n is equal to, and we get ourselves a little bit of a drum roll here, n times 2a plus n minus 1 times d. All of that over 2. Now, we've come up with a general formula, just a function of what our first term is, what our common difference is, and how many terms we're adding up. And so this is the generalized sum of an arithmetic sequence, which we call an arithmetic series. But now, let's ask ourselves this question. This is hard to remember. The n times 2a plus n minus 1 times d over 2. But in the last video, when I did a more concrete example, I said well, it looks like the sum of an arithmetic sequence could be written as perhaps the average of the first term a1 plus an. The average of the first term and the last term times the number of terms that you have. So is this actually the case? Do these two things gel? Because this is very easy to remember-- the average of the first and the last terms multiplied by the number of terms you had and actually makes intuitive sense, because you're just increasing by the same amount every time. So let's just average the first and the last term and then multiply times the number of terms we have. Well, all we have to do is rewrite this a little bit to see that it is indeed the exact same thing as this over here. So all we have to do is break out the a. So let me rewrite it. So, this could be rewritten as s sub n is equal to n times a plus a plus n minus 1 times d. I just broke up this 2a into an a plus a. All of that over 2. And you see, based on how we defined this thing, our first term a1 is a. And then our last term, a sub n, is a plus n minus 1 times d. So this whole business right over here really is the average of the first and last terms. I got my first term, adding it to my last term, dividing it by 2. And then I'm multiplying by the number of terms we have. And that's true for any arithmetic sequence, as we've just shown here.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-3
" -  Look at all these giant trees standing tall and mighty. When I used to look at them, I used to wonder about one question. How do these trees take up water from the ground and push it all the way to the top against the force of gravity? I mean think about it. Some of the trees can grow hundreds of meters tall. So, how do they get that water all the way to the top? The answer is evaporation, that's right. It turns out and this blew my mind away when I learned about this, it turns out more than 95% of the water that they absorb just evaporates into the atmosphere. But doesn't that sound crazy to you? I mean how can evaporation make water go up and what's the whole point? I mean if they are evaporating most of that water, why do they even need water? What's going on? Well, let's find out. Now, before we dive into this, let's back up a little bit. We have seen before that plants and trees can grow so tall because they have evolved pipe like structures within them which are called vascular tissues. They help in transporting the food and water from one part of the body to another. And since we have to transport two things, food and water, there are two separate kind of pipes. One is called xylem which transports mostly water and some dissolved minerals and the other one is called phloem which mostly transports food, f for food, ph for phloem. Now, if you seem to be pretty unfamiliar with these fancy names then we've talked a lot about them in a previous video called intro to vascular tissues. Be great idea to go back and watch that as a refresher. If you feel you're confident, let's go ahead then. So, in this video, since you wanna talk about water we're going to be focusing only on xylem and see how it works. Now, when I was studying about this even before thinking about water, my main question was, where do these pipes come from, right? I mean how did they get there? Turns out that they come from modified cells. For example let's think about how xylem is formed. Well, here's how we like to think about it. So, before xylem was formed we had normal plant cells but as they mature they start losing all of this stuff from inside. They start losing their nucleus, their mitochondria, their cytoplasm, all of that is gone and eventually they lose even these horizontal cell walls as well and all the vertical cell walls join together to form a tall empty pipe, that's our xylem. And since it's empty we can now fill it up with water. And so this might make you wonder, if these cells have lost all of their organelles how are they staying alive. The answer is they aren't. They're all dead. And so important to remember that xylem is made of dead cells, they're no longer alive and just to contrast it turns out that phloem is made of living cells. We'll get to that in another video as to why and how but xylem is made of dead cells. And so now to the big question, how does the water climb up these xylem vessels? Well, like I said before it's due to evaporation. When the water eventually reaches all the cells of the leaves, most of them go out of the tiny pores which are present in these leaves. You might know the names of these pores, they're called stomata. They're useful in exchanging gases. When the stomata opens up, the water gets evaporated in to the atmosphere. But how does this evaporation help in pushing the water up? Well, to figure that out, let's zoom into one of these leaves. So, let's say that this is that same xylem tissue that we just talked about made of dead cells and let's say this is one of the leaves, highly magnified view you imagine and this is one of those pores the stomata through which the water can go out. Now, if we draw some of the water molecules, imagine these are individual molecules of water. I know they seem too big. Molecules are not so big but imagine, okay. And so these are the water molecules that are moving out of the leaves. It turns out that these molecules pretty strongly attract other molecules as well and as a result when these molecules move out they automatically start pulling on the molecules behind them. You'll learn in chemistry that this force is called the hydrogen bonding, okay but don't worry about the names as of now. So, because of this attraction they pull on the molecules behind and as a result these start moving away and then they start pulling on the ones behind them and they start moving on the ones behind them. And so can you see that because of this the force, this pulling force starts from the leaves and goes all the way down to the roots because this is a single column of water, a giant very tall column of water and that's how the force gets transmitted. This is kind of like how she's drinking that juice from the straw. She's sucking on that straw and the juice comes up. Similarly, you can imagine the xylem to be a giant straw. The evaporation causes that suction because of which the water gets pulled up. And so because there's a lot of suction force within the xylem, the walls of the xylem tissue needs to be super thick, thick enough to withstand that force. Now, what do you mean by that? For example, just look at this water bottle. When I start sucking on it look at how easily the walls collapse. There is a similar suction over here but way stronger and so the walls need to be strong enough to not collapse. And so xylem has pretty strong walls because of which it also acts like a backbone to the plants and the trees. And if you're wondering, wood is made of xylem. In fact, the word xylem comes from the Greek xylon which means wood. So, the wood that is used in the furnitures and tables and everything were once a part of this amazing water conducting system. Pretty awesome, right? But you might be thinking, why do plants have to go through all this trouble to suck that water and then just make it evaporate? Why are they doing it in the first place? Well, for many reasons. First of all, they need some of that water. They don't throw all of it away. Some of that water is useful in photosynthesis. But more importantly this running stream of water helps in transporting the minerals, the important minerals from the soil to all the cells of the plant. So, this water acts like a train where the minerals hop in at the soil and then when they reach their destination at the leaves they get absorbed, the water gets thrown away and the process repeats. So, it's because of this the the trees get the important minerals because of which they can grow. And if that's not enough evaporation is also useful in cooling them down just like how when you go out in a hot sun you start sweating because when that sweat evaporates your body gets cooled down. In a similar manner, these trees and plants are always in the hot sun during the daytime. So, they need to cool off as well and so instead of sweat they just evaporate these water and that helps them cool down. And so you can see evaporation is a big deal for these plants and trees. It's such a big deal that scientists thought, let's give it a different name altogether. So, the evaporation that happens in the trees from their plants, from the stomata, it's called transpiration. Okay, transpiration. And why is this transpiration useful? Because it causes suction force. So, it causes suction because of which the water gets pulled up and all the minerals get transported and also it causes cooling, this is called evaporative cooling. Both of these are essential and that's how xylem pretty much works. But if you're really curious, you might ask one final question. What happens during the night time? Because transpiration requires heat which you can get during the daytime but during night time there's hardly any transpiration. So, what keeps that column of water up and running? Why doesn't it just fall down? That's because there is a second force that is causing this water to go up. This force originates from the roots itself, it's called the root pressure because it comes from the roots and it's this force that makes sure during the night time the column just doesn't fall down. So, there are both forces acting. There's a suction force due to transpiration and there is this root pressure. During the daytime, the transpiration dominates but during the nighttime because there is no transpiration, root pressure is the only force. But how does that work? Well, to quickly give you an overview, here we have zoomed in to the tip of one of the tiny root hairs. And what you're seeing over here is the water and these dots represent minerals. So, we have water and dissolved minerals in the soil and we also have water and dissolved minerals in these root hairs. And the concentration is pretty much even because diffusion makes sure of that. 1But now the cells of these root hairs 1start messing with the concentration balance. 1They start absorbing the minerals from their surrounding. 1So, look at the minerals carefully. 1They start absorbing it from the soil 1and this cannot happen all by itself, 1the cells need to spend energy to bring those minerals in. 1And because of that it's called an active process 1or an active transport. 1Active means they're using energy to transport the minerals 1inside their cells. 1And now look at what has happened. 1Because the soil lost the minerals, 1this solution has become dilute 1because there's a lot of water but there's less minerals 1and the solution inside the root has become concentrated, 1more concentrated than outside. 1And nature does not like that, nature needs balance. 1So, either the minerals have to flow back out 1but the cells don't allow that, 1they use energy to make sure that doesn't happen. 1But if that can't happen, you know what nature does? 1It makes sure that the water starts going in, 1the water starts rushing in. 1Think about it. 1Because the outside region is more dilute, 1the water moves out from that 1and enters the more concentrated region. 1It starts diluting this as well. 1And in the process notice the water starts rushing in. 1You may have heard of this process. 1This process is called osmosis. 1It's a special kind of diffusion in which 1particles don't move from higher concentration 1to lower concentration but instead the water starts moving 1from lower concentration to higher concentration. 1but the idea is the same 1to balance the concentration. 1And as a result of this osmosis, 1now can you see that because water is rushing in 1it starts pushing on the column of the water 1that's already present over here 1and that's what causes the pressure from the bottom. 1This is called the root pressure. 1Let me just write that down. 1This pressure is called root pressure. 1And in more general because it is happening due to osmosis 1you can also call this as the osmotic pressure. 1And so this root pressure forces the water to go up as well. 1It's not as strong as their suction produced 1due to transpiration but during the night time 1this is the only available force. 1So, this makes sure that the column doesn't fall down. 1And that's pretty much it. 1So, to quickly summarize, what did we learn in this video? 1We saw that xylem tissues are made of dead cells 1which help in transporting water up 1and it happens due to two forces. 1One is the transpiration in which the water evaporates 1and causes suction 1which literally sucks the water from the roots. 1And we saw that transpiration also helps 1in cooling the plants off. 1And the second pressure is the root pressure. 1This is where the roots are actively absorbing the minerals, 1increasing the concentration and thereby causing osmosis. 1And so this continuous upstream of water makes sure 1that every single cell gets the required minerals 1from the soil and helps recycle the water from the ground 1into the atmosphere.",science_class-10-biology_in-in-life-processes
" We're given a system of equations here, and we're told to solve for x and y. Now, the easiest thing to do here, since in both equations they're explicitly solved for y, is say, well, if y is equal to that, and y also has to equal this second equation, then why don't we just set them equal to each other? Or another way to think about it is, if y is equal to this whole thing right over here-- that's what that first equation is telling us-- and if we have to find an x and a y that satisfy both of these equations, if y is equal to that, why can't I just substitute that right here for y? And if we do that, the left-hand side of this bottom equation becomes negative 1/4x plus 100. And then that is going to be equal to this right-hand side-- and I'll do it in the same color-- is equal to negative 1/4x plus 120. Now, the first thing we might want to do is maybe get all of our x terms onto the left- or the right-hand side of the equation. And if we wanted to get rid of these x terms from the right-hand side, get them on the left-hand side, the best thing to do is to add 1/4x to both sides of this equation. So let me do that. So we're going to add 1/4x here, add 1/4x here, and you might already be sensing that something shady is going on. So let's do it. So negative 1/4x plus 1/4x. They cancel out. You get 0x. So the left side of the equation is just 100. And then the right side of the equation, same thing. Negative 1/4x plus 1/4x. They cancel out. No x's. And you're just left with is equal to 120. Which we know is definitely not the case. 100 is not equal to 120. We got this nonsensical equation here, that 100 equals 120. So this type of system has no solution. You know it has no solution because in order for it to have any solution, these two numbers would have to be equal to each other, and they are not equal to each other. And if you look at the original equations, it might jump out at you why they have no solutions. Both of these lines, or both of these equations, if you view them as lines, have the exact same slope. But they have different y-intercepts. So if I just were to do a really quick graph here. That's my y-axis, that is my x-axis, so it's y and x. This first graph over here, its y-intercept is 100. Let me do it a little bit lower. Its y-intercept-- let's say that that is 100, so it intersects right there. And there's a slope of negative 1/4. So maybe it looks something like this. That's that first line. This second line-- I'll do it in pink right here-- y is equal to negative 1/4x plus 120, its y-intercept might be right here at 120. But it has the same slope, negative 1/4, so its slope, the line would look something like this. So you see that there are no x and y points that satisfy both of these equations. Another way to think about it. If y-- you take an x. This first equation says, OK, you take your x, multiply it by negative 1/4, and add 100, and that's going to give you y. Now, here we say, well, you take that same x, and you multiply it by negative 1/4 and add 120, and that has to be equal to y. Well, the only way that that would ever be true is if 100 and 120 were the same number, and they're not the same number. So you're never going to have a solution of this system. These two lines are never going to intersect, and that's because they have the exact same slope.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-systems-topic
" In the video on electronegativity, we learned how to determine whether a covalent bond is polar or nonpolar. In this video, we're going to see how we figure out whether molecules are polar or nonpolar and also how to apply that polarity to what we call intermolecular forces. Intermolecular forces are the forces that are between molecules. And so that's different from an intramolecular force, which is the force within a molecule. So a force within a molecule would be something like the covalent bond. And an intermolecular force would be the force that are between molecules. And so let's look at the first intermolecular force. It's called a dipole-dipole interaction. And let's analyze why it has that name. If I look at one of these molecules of acetone here and I focus in on the carbon that's double bonded to the oxygen, I know that oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. And so we have four electrons in this double bond between the carbon and the oxygen. So I'll try to highlight them right here. And since oxygen is more electronegative, oxygen is going to pull those electrons closer to it, therefore giving oxygen a partial negative charge. Those electrons in yellow are moving away from this carbon. So the carbon's losing a little bit of electron density, and this carbon is becoming partially positive like that. And so for this molecule, we're going to get a separation of charge, a positive and a negative charge. So we have a polarized double bond situation here. We also have a polarized molecule. And so there's two different poles, a negative and a positive pole here. And so we say that this is a polar molecule. So acetone is a relatively polar molecule. The same thing happens to this acetone molecule down here. So we get a partial negative, and we get a partial positive. So this is a polar molecule as well. It has two poles. So we call this a dipole. So each molecule has a dipole moment. And because each molecule is polar and has a separation of positive and negative charge, in organic chemistry we know that opposite charges attract, right? So this negatively charged oxygen is going to be attracted to this positively charged carbon. And so there's going to be an electrostatic attraction between those two molecules. And that's what's going to hold these two molecules together. And you would therefore need energy if you were to try to pull them apart. And so the boiling point of acetone turns out to be approximately 56 degrees Celsius. And since room temperature is between 20 and 25, at room temperature we have not reached the boiling point of acetone. And therefore, acetone is still a liquid. So at room temperature and pressure, acetone is a liquid. And it has to do with the intermolecular force of dipole-dipole interactions holding those molecules together. And the intermolecular force, in turn, depends on the electronegativity. Let's look at another intermolecular force, and this one's called hydrogen bonding. So here we have two water molecules. And once again, if I think about these electrons here, which are between the oxygen and the hydrogen, I know oxygen's more electronegative than hydrogen. So oxygen's going to pull those electrons closer to it, giving the oxygen a partial negative charge like that. The hydrogen is losing a little bit of electron density, therefore becoming partially positive. The same situation exists in the water molecule down here. So we have a partial negative, and we have a partial positive. And so like the last example, we can see there's going to be some sort of electrostatic attraction between those opposite charges, between the negatively partially charged oxygen, and the partially positive hydrogen like that. And so this is a polar molecule. Of course, water is a polar molecule. And so you would think that this would be an example of dipole-dipole interaction. And it is, except in this case it's an even stronger version of dipole-dipole interaction that we call hydrogen bonding. So at one time it was thought that it was possible for hydrogen to form an extra bond. And that's where the term originally comes from. But of course, it's not an actual intramolecular force. We're talking about an intermolecular force. But it is the strongest intermolecular force. The way to recognize when hydrogen bonding is present as opposed to just dipole-dipole is to see what the hydrogen is bonded to. And so in this case, we have a very electronegative atom, hydrogen, bonded-- oxygen, I should say-- bonded to hydrogen. And then that hydrogen is interacting with another electronegative atom like that. So we have a partial negative, and we have a partial positive, and then we have another partial negative over here. And this is the situation that you need to have when you have hydrogen bonding. Here's your hydrogen showing intermolecular force here. And what some students forget is that this hydrogen actually has to be bonded to another electronegative atom in order for there to be a big enough difference in electronegativity for there to be a little bit extra attraction. And so the three electronegative elements that you should remember for hydrogen bonding are fluorine, oxygen, and nitrogen. And so the mnemonics that students use is FON. So if you remember FON as the electronegative atoms that can participate in hydrogen bonding, you should be able to remember this intermolecular force. The boiling point of water is, of course, about 100 degrees Celsius, so higher than what we saw for acetone. And this just is due to the fact that hydrogen bonding is a stronger version of dipole-dipole interaction, and therefore, it takes more energy or more heat to pull these water molecules apart in order to turn them into a gas. And so, of course, water is a liquid at room temperature. All right. Let's look at another intermolecular force. And this one is called London dispersion forces. So these are the weakest intermolecular forces, and they have to do with the electrons that are always moving around in orbitals. And even though the methane molecule here, if we look at it, we have a carbon surrounded by four hydrogens for methane. And it's hard to tell in how I've drawn the structure here, but if you go back and you look at the video for the tetrahedral bond angle proof, you can see that in three dimensions, these hydrogens are coming off of the carbon, and they're equivalent in all directions. And there's a very small difference in electronegativity between the carbon and the hydrogen. And that small difference is canceled out in three dimensions. So the methane molecule becomes nonpolar as a result of that. So this one's nonpolar, and, of course, this one's nonpolar. And so there's no dipole-dipole interaction. There's no hydrogen bonding. The only intermolecular force that's holding two methane molecules together would be London dispersion forces. And so once again, you could think about the electrons that are in these bonds moving in those orbitals. And let's say for the molecule on the left, if for a brief transient moment in time you get a little bit of negative charge on this side of the molecule, so it might turn out to be those electrons have a net negative charge on this side. And then for this molecule, the electrons could be moving the opposite direction, giving this a partial positive. And so there could be a very, very small bit of attraction between these two methane molecules. It's very weak, which is why London dispersion forces are the weakest intermolecular forces. But it is there. And that's the only thing that's holding together these methane molecules. And since it's weak, we would expect the boiling point for methane to be extremely low. And, of course, it is. So the boiling point for methane is somewhere around negative 164 degrees Celsius. And so since room temperature is somewhere around 20 to 25, obviously methane has already boiled, if you will, and turned into a gas. So methane is obviously a gas at room temperature and pressure. Now, if you increase the number of carbons, you're going to increase the number of attractive forces that are possible. And if you do that, you can actually increase the boiling point of other hydrocarbons dramatically. And so even though London dispersion forces are the weakest, if you have larger molecules and you sum up all those extra forces, it can actually turn out to be rather significant when you're working with larger molecules. And so this is just a quick summary of some of the intermolecular forces to show you the application of electronegativity and how important it is.",science_organic-chemistry_gen-chem-review
" -  What we're going to do in this video is practice squaring binomials, and this is something that we've done in the past, but we're gonna do it with slightly more involved expressions. But let's just start with a little bit of review. If I were to ask you, what is a plus b squared, what would that be? Pause the video and try to figure it out. Well some of you might immediately know what a binomial like this squared is, but I'll work it out. So this is the same thing as a plus b times a plus b. And then we could multiply this a times that a. So that's going to give us a squared. And then I can multiply that a times that b, and that's going to give us ab. Then I could multiply this b times that a. I could write that as ba or ab, so I'll just write it as ab again. And then I multiply this b times that b, so plus b squared. And what I really just did is apply the distributive property twice. We go into a lot of detail in previous videos. Some people also like to call it the FOIL method. Either way, this should all be a review. If it's not, I encourage you to look at those introductory videos. But this is going to simplify to a squared plus we have an ab and another ab, so you add those together, you get two ab plus b squared. Now why did I go through this review? Well now we can use this idea that a plus b squared is equal to a squared plus two ab plus b squared to tackle things that at least look a little bit more involved. So if I were to ask you, what is five x to the sixth plus four squared, pause this video and try to figure it out. And try to keep this and this in mind. Well there is several ways you could approach this. You could just expand this out the way we just did, or you could recognize this pattern that we just established. That if I have an a plus b and I square it, it's going to be this. And so what you might notice is, the role of a is being played by five x to the sixth right over there, and the role of b is being played by four right over there. So we could say, hey, this is going to be equal to a squared, we have our a squared there. So what is a squared? Well five x to the sixth squared is going to be 25 x to the 12th power. And then it's going to be plus two times a times b. So plus two times five x to the sixth times four. Actually let me just write it out just so we don't confuse ourselves. Two times five x to the, I'll color code it too, two times five x to the sixth times four, times four, plus b squared. So plus four squared, so that's going to be plus 16. And then we can simplify this. So this is going to be equal to 25 x to the 12th. Two times five times four is 40. Two times five is 10 times four is 40. So plus 40 x to the sixth plus 16. Let's do another example. And I'll do this one even a little bit faster, just because we're getting, I think, pretty good at this. So let's say we're trying to determine what three t squared minus seven t to the sixth power squared is. Pause the video and try to figure it out. All right we're going to do it together now. So this is our a, and our b now we should view as negative seven t to the sixth. Because this says plus b, so you could view this as plus negative seven t to the sixth. We could even write that if we wanted. We could write this plus negative seven t to the sixth if it helps us recognize this whole thing as b. So this is going to be equal to a squared, which is nine t to the fourth, plus two times this times this, two times a times b. So two times three t squared is going to be six t squared times negative seven t to the sixth. Actually let me write this out. This is getting a little bit complicated. So this is going to be plus two times three t squared times negative seven t to the sixth power. And then last but not least, we're going to square negative seven t to the sixth. So that's going to be negative seven squared is positive 49, and t to the sixth squared is t to the 12th, t to the 12th power. And so this is going to be equal to nine t to the fourth, and let's see, two times three is six times negative seven is negative 42, and t squared times t to the sixth, we add the exponents, we have the same base, so it's going to be t to the eighth. And then we have plus 49 t to the 12th power. So it looks like we did something really fancy. We have this higher degree polynomial. We were squaring this binomial that has these higher degree terms. But we're really just applying the same idea that we learned many many many videos ago, many many lessons ago, in terms of just squaring binomials.",math_math3_poly-arithmetic
" Let's see if we can stumble our way to another logarithm property. So let's say that the log base x of A is equal to B. That's the same thing as saying that x to the B is equal to A. Fair enough. So what I want to do is experiment. What happens if I multiply this expression by another variable? Let's call it C. So I'm going to multiply both sides of this equation times C. And I'll just switch colors just to keep things interesting. That's not an x that's a C. I should probably just do a dot instead. Times C. So I'm going to multiply both sides of this equation times C. So I get C times log base x of A is equal to-- multiply both sides of the equation-- is equal to B times C. Fair enough. I think you realize I have not done anything profound just yet. But let's go back. We said that this is the same thing as this. So let's experiment with something. Let's raise this side to the power of C. So I'm going to raise this side to the power of C. That's a kind of caret. And when you type exponents that's what you would use, a caret. So I'm going to raise it to the power of C. So then, this side is x to the B to the C power, is equal to A to the C. All I did is I raised both sides of this equation to the Cth power. And what do we know about when you raise something to an exponent and you raise that whole thing to another exponent, what happens to the exponents? Well, that's just exponent rule and you just multiply those two exponents. This just implies that x to the BC is equal to A to the C. What can we do now? Well, I don't know. Let's take the logarithm of both sides. Or let's just write this-- let's not take the logarithm of both sides. Let's write this as a logarithm expression. We know that x to the BC is equal to A to the C. Well, that's the exact same thing as saying that the logarithm base x of A to the C is equal to BC. Correct? Because all I did is I rewrote this as a logarithm expression. And I think now you realized that something interesting has happened. That BC, well, of course, it's the same thing as this BC. So this expression must be equal to this expression. And I think we have another logarithm property. That if I have some kind of a coefficient in front of the logarithm where I'm multiplying the logarithm, so if I have C log-- Clog base x of A, but that's C times the logarithm base x of A. That equals the log base x of A to the C. So you could take this coefficient and instead make it an exponent on the term inside the logarithm. That is another logarithm property. So let's review what we know so far about logarithms. We know that if I write-- let me say-- well, let me just with the letters I've been using. C times logarithm base x of A is equal to logarithm base x of A to the C. We know that. And we know-- we just learned that logarithm base x of A plus logarithm base x of B is equal to the logarithm base x of A times B. Now let me ask you a question. What happens if instead of a positive sign here we put a negative sign? Well, you could probably figure it out yourself but we could do that same exact proof that we did in the beginning. But in this time we will set it up with a negative. Let's just say that log base x of A is equal to l. Let's say that log base x of B is equal to m. Let's say that log base x of A divided by B is equal to n. How can we write all of these expressions as exponents? Well, this just says that x to the l is equal to A. Let me switch colors. That keeps it interesting. This is just saying that x to the m is equal to B. And this is just saying that x to the n is equal to A/B. So what can we do here? Well what's another way of writing A/B? Well, that's just the same thing as writing x to the l because that's A, over x to the m. That's B. And this we know from our exponent rules-- this could also be written as x to the l, x to the negative m. Or that also equals x to the l minus m. So what do we know? We know that x to the n is equal to x to the l minus m. Those equal each other. I just made a big equal chain here. So we know that n is equal to l minus m. Well, what does that do for us? Well, what's another way of writing n? I'm going to do it up here because I think we have stumbled upon another logarithm rule. What's another way of writing n? Well, I did it right here. This is another way of writing n. So logarithm base x of A/B-- this is an x over here-- is equal to l. l is this right here. Log base x of A is equal to l. The log base x of A minus m. I wrote m right here. That's log base x of B. There you go. I probably didn't have to prove it. You could've probably tried it out with dividing it, but whatever. But you know are hopefully satisfied that we have this new logarithm property right there. Now I have one more logarithm property to show you, but I don't think I have time to show it in this video. So I will do it in the next video. I'll see you soon.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-3
" So our goal in this video is to take the antiderivative of this fairly crazy looking expression. Or another way of saying it is to find the indefinite integral of this crazy looking expression. And the key realization right over here is that this expression is made up of a bunch of terms. And the indefinite integral of the entire expression is going to be equal to the indefinite integral of each of the term. So this is going to be equal to, we could look at this term right over here, and just take the indefinite that, 7x to the third dx. And then from that, we can subtract the indefinite integral of this thing. So we could say this is, and then minus the indefinite integral of 5 times the square root of x dx. And then we can look at this one right over here. So then we could say plus the indefinite integral of 18 square root of x. Square roots of x, over x to the third dx. And then finally, I'm running out of colors here, finally I need more colors in my thing. We can take the antiderivative of this. So plus the antiderivative of x to the negative 40th power dx. So I've just rewritten this and color-coded things. So let's take the antiderivative of each of these. And you'll see that we'll be able to do it using our whatever we want to call it. The inverse of the power rule, or the anti-power rule, whatever you might want to call it. So let's look at the first one. So we have-- what I'm going to do is, I'm just going to find the antiderivative without the constant, and just add the constant at the end. For the sake of this one. Just to make sure we get the most general antiderivative. So here the exponent is a 3. So we can increase it by 1. So it's going to be x to the 4th. Let me do that same purple color, or pink color. It's going to be x to the 4th, or we're going to divide by x to the 4th. So it's x to the 4th over 4 is the antiderivative of x to the 3rd. And you just had this scaling quantity, the seven out front. So we can still just have the seven out front. So we get 7x to the 4th over 4. Fair enough. From that, we're going to subtract the antiderivative of this. Now at first this might not be obvious, that you could use our inverse power rule, or anti-power rule here. But then you just need to realize that 5 times the principal root of x is the same thing as 5 times x to the 1/2 power. And so once again, the exponent here is 1/2. We can increment it by 1. So it's going to be x to the 3/2. And then divide by the incremented exponent. So divide by 3/2. And of course we had this 5 out front, so we still want to have the 5 out front. Now this next expression looks even wackier. But once again, we can simplify a little bit. This is the same thing-- let me do it right over here-- this is the same thing as 18 times x to the 1/2 times x to the negative 3 power. x to the 3rd in the denominator is the same thing as x to the negative 3. We have the same base, we could just add the exponents. So this is going to be equal to 18 times x to the 2 and 1/2 power. Or another way of thinking about it, this is the same thing as 18 times x to the 5/2 power. Did I do that right? Yeah. Negative 3. Oh sorry, this is negative 2 and 1/2. Let me make this very clear. And this is going to be the negative 5/2 power. x to the negative 3 is the same thing as x to the negative 6/2. Negative 6/2 plus 1/2 is negative 5/2. So once again, we just have to increment this exponent. So negative 5/2 plus 1 is going to be negative 3/2. So you're going to have x to the negative 3/2. And then you divide by what your exponent is when you increment it. So divide it by negative 3/2. And then you had the 18 out front. And we obviously are going to have to simplify this. And then finally, our exponent in this term. Let me not use that purple anymore. The exponent in this term right over here is negative 40. If we increment it, we get x to the negative 39 power, all of that over negative 39. And now we can add our constant, c. And all we need to do is simplify all of this craziness. So the first one is fairly simplified. We can write it as 7/4 x to the 4th. Now this term right over here is essentially negative 5 divided by 3/2. So 5 over 3/2 is equal to 5 times 2/3, which is equal to 10 over 3. So this thing right over here simplifies to negative 10/3 x to the 3/2. And then we have all of this craziness. Now 18 divided by negative 3/2 is equal to 18 times negative 2/3. Which is equal to, well we can simplify this a little bit, this is the same thing as 6 times negative 2. Which is equal to negative 12. So this expression right over here is negative 12x to the negative 3/2. And then finally, this one right over here, we can just rewrite it as, if we want, we could, well, we could just write negative 1/39 x to the negative 39 plus c. And we're done. We've found the indefinite integral of all this craziness. And I encourage you to take the derivative of this. And you can do it using really just the power rule, to take the derivative of this. And verify that it does indeed equal this expression that we took the antiderivative of.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-integrals
" -  ""Find the coordinates of all points ""on the curve at which the line tangent ""to the curve at that point is vertical."" So we wanna figure out the points on that curve where the tangent line is vertical. So let's just remind ourselves what the slope of a tangent line is, or what it isn't. I guess this may be a better way to think about it. If you have a horizontal line, so let me draw a horizontal line. If you have a horizontal line like that, well then your slope is zero. Or you can say your rate of change of y with respect to x is equal to zero. What about a vertical line? If you have a vertical line like that, what is your rate of change of y with respect to x? Well, some people might say it's infinity, or you could say it's undefined. It's undefined in some way because at some point your rate, or one way to think about it, you're gonna try to divide by zero because you have a huge change in y over no change in x. Or another way to think about it that's a little bit more in line with that is you could say that your change in x with respect to change in y, notice I took took the reciprocal, so now we're talking about a change at the derivative of x with respect to y is equal to zero because your y can change, but as your y changes, your x does not change. So can we use this little insight here on vertical lines to think about the coordinates of all points in the curve at which the line tangent to the curve at that point is vertical. Well before, they told us, they gave us the curve of the equation, and they also told us what dy, dx is. Let me just rewrite 'em again just so we have 'em there. So we know that y to the third minus xy is equal to two. This is the equation of our curve. And we know that dy, dx is equal to y over 3y squared minus x. So one thing we could do is, well, let's just figure out what the derivative of x with respect to y is and set that to be equal to zero. So this is the derivative of y with respect to x. If we take the reciprocal of that, the derivative of x with respect to y, it's just the reciprocal of this, is going to be the reciprocal of what we have here. So it's going to be 3y squared minus x over y. And if we want this to be equal to zero, like we said right over here, well then that's only going to happen if the numerator is equal to zero. So we could say, okay, at what x, y pair does this numerator equal to zero? 3y squared minus x is equal to zero. Can add x to both sides and you get 3y squared is equal to x. Now, another way you could have thought about it is, well, at what x and y values does the derivative of y with respect to x become undefined? Well, that's gonna become undefined if the denominator here is zero. But when you're dealing with things like undefined, it gets a little bit more hand-wavy. I like to just think of this as the rate at which x is changing with respect to y is zero. And so that got us to the same conclusion. Well, for that to be true, x has to be equal to 3y squared. And of course, the x, y pair has to also satisfy the equation for the curve. So why don't we use both of these constraints, and then we can solve for x and y? And so the easiest thing I can think of doing is let's substitute x with 3y squared because they are the same, that's the second constraint. So if we take our original equation of the curve, we get y to the third minus, instead of writing x, I could 3y squared. 3y squared times y is equal to two. And so we get y to the third minus 3y to the third is equal to two. This is negative 2y to the third is equal to two. Can divide both sides by negative two and we get y to the third is equal to negative one, or y is equal to negative one. Negative one to the third power is negative one. Now if y is negative one, what is x? Well, x is going to be equal to three times negative one squared. So negative one squared is just one, so x is going to be equal to three. So the point on that curve at which the tangent line is vertical is going to be the point three, comma, negative one. And we are all done.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-solved-exams
" -  Let's discuss the presentation and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Recall that diabetes mellitus is a group of disorders that can be caused by multiple different underlying mechanisms. However, all the different types are diagnosed in the same way, and that is a combination of clinical presentation and diagnostic tests. So let's erase this here and start with the presentation of diabetes mellitus. Recall there are two types of diabetes, type I and type II, and depending on the type the disease presentation will differ. And there are three main ways in which someone with diabetes will present before they're diagnosed with the disease, and they are acute, subacute, and asymptomatic. Now let's start with the acute presentation. This is the most severe presenting situation and can be life threatening for both type I and type II diabetes. This individual becomes very sick over a relatively short period of time, usually only a couple of days. Now symptoms will include things like nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and this often results in severe dehydration, and as such the individual may even become confused or unconscious as a result. In type I diabetes, this is known as diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA for short. And it is how about 30% of individuals with type I diabetes will initially present before diagnosis. In type II diabetes, the acute presentation has a much longer name. It's known as hyperosmolar nonketotic state, or HHNS for short, and it's much less common than DKA as it's the initial presentation for only about 2% of individuals with type II diabetes. Now the difference between DKA and HHNS has to do with the difference between the underlying mechanisms of type I diabetes and type II diabetes. Now the most important difference is that in DKA the individual will become acidotic due to the production of ketoacids, hence the name diabetic ketoacidosis as opposed to hyperosmolar nonketotic state where ketoacids are not produced. Now the next way individuals with diabetes can present is what we'll call subacute. And this is a mild to moderate presentation that occurs over a period of weeks to months. And these individuals or maybe someone close to them notice that they are generally just not feeling as well as they normally do and they may experience symptoms of fatigue, increased thirst, frequent urination, or even weight loss. Now, once again this can occur with either type I or type II diabetes. And in type I diabetes, this is the most common form of presentation before diagnosis, accounting for about 70% of individuals with type I diabetes. In type II diabetes, this is also common, however the predomit symptoms are a little bit more vague and weight loss is less common. Then the last way individuals with diabetes can present is through asymptomatic screening tests. So type II diabetes affects nearly 10% of the population, and due to this high prevalence, potentially severe complications, and the relative ease of treatment, most adults, especially those with the risk factors of type II diabetes should be routinely screened for the disease. And this is the most common means by which type II diabetes is diagnosed. However, it's rare for the diagnosis of type I diabetes as routine screening for type I diabetes is not usually performed. So let's move on to the diagnostic tests for diabetes mellitus Regardless of the type of diabetes or the severity of presentation, laboratory tests are necessary for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. So let's briefly review the general mechanism of diabetes to gain a better understanding of the two major laboratory tests that are used to diagnose the disease. As the blood glucose levels in the body rise, this is sensed by the beta cells in the pancreas which secrete the hormone insulin. And insulin then acts on cells throughout the body to take the glucose from the blood up and thus lower the blood glucose levels. So in diabetes mellitus, regardless of the type, this insulin pathway is not working properly, therefore the body is not able to lower blood glucose levels. And this results in increased blood glucose levels known as hyperglycemia, which is the characteristic finding of diabetes mellitus. Now a side effect of hyperglycemia is a proccess known as glycosylation, which is the non-enzymatic attachment of glucose to proteins. And one protein that this occurs with that is of importance in diabetes mellitus is the protein hemoglobin which is located within red blood cells. And in the presence of hyperglycemia, glucose will attach itself to an abnormally high percentage of hemoglobin within the red blood cells. And this is known as glycosylated hemoglobin, or hemoglobin A1C, and it's the hyperglycemia and the hemoglobin A1C that are tested for in the blood to aid in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. So let's put this diagram over here to the side and discuss a little bit more about these diagnostic tests. First, let's talk about the three categories of results for the diagnostic tests. And the first is a normal level. The second is the level that's associated with diabetes. And then in between is a third category, and it relates only to type II diabetes, and it's known as pre-diabetes. Since type II diabetes is a chronic disease that typically takes many years to develop and it's routinely screened for, often times individuals will have a test result that is above the normal level however not severe enough to be considered diabetes and this is known as pre-diabetes. And it's important because individuals with pre-diabetes, as it's name suggests, are much more likely to develop type II diabetes in the future. So by identifying them as having pre-diabetes, they can start treating the underlying mechanism through lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, proper diet, and routine exercise in order to prevent or delay the development of type II diabetes in the future. Now, as we mentioned before, there are two major types of laboratory tests used to diagnose diabetes mellitus, and they are blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1C. The blood glucose level can be measured by many different methods and, unfortunately, depending on the method the results will vary. So the three most common methods are random, fasting, and a two-hour glucose tolerance test which we'll just abbreviate GTT. Now we'll bring in the the different diagnostic levels here, however the exact numbers for each of these categories are less important than a couple of trends. And the first one is that regardless of the method: random, fasting, or the two-hour glucose tolerance test, a blood glucose level of greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL is consistent with diabetes. But this number is slightly lower if fasting blood glucose levels is used. Then the level is 126 mg/dL. Then the last important point to mention is that a random glucose test can not be used to diagnose pre-diabetes. You need either a fasting or a two-hour glucose tolerance test. Now, fortunately hemoglobin A1C testing is a little bit more straight forward, as the timing of the test does not matter. And then similarly to the blood glucose test, there's one important number to remember. And that is that a level greater than or equal to 6.5% is consistent with diabetes mellitus. So now that we have a better understanding of the clinical presentation of diabetes mellitus and the laboratory tests, let's bring these two components together to discuss how the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is made. Neither the presentation or the diagnostic tests alone is enough to diagnose diabetes. The diagnosis is made by a combination of the two. And there are two ways diabetes mellitus can be diagnosed, and they're based on different presentations. So first, if an individual has symptoms of diabetes, whether acute or subacute, then only one positive test, either the blood glucose or the hemoglobin A1C is necessary for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. However, if the individual is asymptomatic, then a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus requires two positive tests that are separated by at least one week of time.",science_health-and-medicine_endocrine-system-diseases
" y equals 1/8 x to the third minus x squared. Over which interval does y of x have an average rate of change of 1/2? So let's go interval by interval and calculate the average rate of change. So first let's think about this interval right over here. x is between negative 2 and 2. So negative 2 is less than x, which is less than 2. So let's just think about what is the value of our function when x is equal to negative 2? So y of negative 2 is equal to 1/8 times negative 2 to the third power minus negative 2 squared, which is equal to-- let's see, negative 2 the third power is negative 8. Negative 8 divided by 8 is negative 1. Negative 2 squared is positive 4, but then you're going to have to subtract that, so it's minus 4. So this is equal to negative 5. And y of 2 is equal to 1/8 times 2 to the third power minus 2 squared. And that's going to be equal to 1/8 times 8 is 1 minus 4, which is equal to negative 3. So if you want to find your average rate of change, you want to figure out how much does the value of your function change, and divide that by how much your x has changed. So we could make a table here. x, y. When x is negative 2, y is negative 5. When x is positive 2, y is negative 3. So how much did your y change? Well, your y increased by 2, and your x increased by 4. And you could get these numbers-- you could just look at it that y increased from that point to that point, x increased from that point to that point. Or you could say hey, negative 3 minus negative 5 is positive 2. That's the difference between negative 3 and negative 5. If you said 2 minus negative 4, well that gives you, once again, the distance, or the difference. It would give you positive 4. But if you look at it here, it's clear. When y increased by 2-- Or we could say when x increased by 4, y increased by 2. So our average rate of change over this interval is going to be average rate of change of y with respect to x is going to be equal to, well, when x changed by 4, by positive 4, y changed by positive 2. So it's equal to 1/2. So it does look like the average rate of change over this interval right over here is 1/2. So we got lucky in this situation, our first choice-- and this is a multiple choice, so it's not a multiselect here. So our first one met our criteria. So we know that that's the answer. But let me do one more of these other ones to show you why that is not the answer. So let's find the average rate of change between that point and that point. So let's do another-- let me do it in another color. So I'll do this one in purple. So 0 is less than x, which is less than 4. And I'll just do the table right over here. x and y. So when x is 0, what is y? Well, it's going to be 1/8 times 0 minus 0, and y is just going to be 0. When x is 4, what is y? Well y is going to be-- let's see, it's going to be 1/8-- trying to do this in my head. 1/8 times 4 to the third. 4 to the third is 64. 1/8 of 64 is 8. It's going to be 8 minus 4 squared, which is 16. 8 minus 16 is negative 8. So in this one, x is increasing by 4, x has increased by 4, what happened to y? y has decreased by 8. So the average rate of change of y with respect to x here is y changed-- so I could write my change in y-- this Greek letter delta just literally is shorthand for change in. My change in y is negative 8 when my change in x is 4. So the average rate of change here is negative 2. It's negative because as x increased, your y decreased. And on average, for every 1 that x increased, y decreased by 2. That's where you get your negative 2 here. So this clearly, the average rate of change is not 1/2. So that confirms that that is not the answer. And we know that these other two, and I encourage you to try them out, will also give you an average rate of change of something other than positive 1/2.",math_algebra-home_alg-functions
" Let's say I've got some type of a book over here. So there is my book. I'll write it down, book. Let me draw the entire book. So this is my entire book, just like that. And then I have a mirror over here. So this is a mirror. We're just looking at the mirror from the side-- I can do a better job of a straight line than that-- so that is a mirror. Now, what I want to do is pick, and I'm really picking an arbitrary point on this book. And we know that there's light that is coming on this book-- maybe I haven't told us about the light source-- but we're assuming that the book will reflect the light diffusely, like most books do. It is not a shiny book. And so any point on this book, and we could pick any arbitrary point on this book, is going to be emitting light in a whole bunch of directions. So what I'm just going to do is pick two light rays that are being emitted from this point on the book. It'll be more than two, but this will help us understand what's going on here. So let me pick one light ray that goes like this-- it's obviously not curving like that-- so it goes like this, and hits the mirror. Incident angle is equal to reflected angle, so it'll reflect off at the same angle just like that. And let me pick another point that is coming out radially from that same, or another ray that is coming out radially from that same point, so it'll come out like that. It has a larger incident angle, so it'll have a larger reflected angle, just like that. And now let's think about what an observer, someone who has their eyeball right over here-- so let's say someone has their eyeball right over here. Let me draw their eyebrows so that you get the general idea-- let's think about what this person right over here will actually see. And remember all of reality is really just a big simulation going on in our brains. Now, this person's eye is going to see these two light rays diverging from some common point. If you were to look straight at the book-- let me just do another example-- if someone were to just look at any arbitrary object, let's say that's an orange right over there. And just ignore all the stuff on the left. If I were to look at an orange, no mirror, nothing, no reflections, or anything, if I were to look at a certain point on the orange, light from that point would be diverging out radially. And if my eye were right over there, my brain says, OK, I have these light rays diverging from a single point. It will simulate, or it will show me that point of an orange in my brain. Now, The same thing is going to happen here, even though these two rays actually aren't diverging from a point out here. Your brain will say, OK, I got two things that are coming out from what looks like a point over here. It'll really just extrapolate these lines backwards. So it'll take that green ray and it'll say, OK, it must be coming from a point out there. And it'll take that magenta ray and it'll say, it must be coming from a point out there. Your eye is just seeing these two light rays, it doesn't know what's going on over here. It just says OK, they're just converging from a point. And so in this person's reality, or in my reality, I think that there is an orange there. Likewise, I see these two light rays diverging from some common point. I will extrapolate to figure out-- or my brain will try to think about-- where that point is in three dimensional space. It says, look, these two rays look like they're coming from a point back over here. Now, the reality is, there is no back over here. There is nothing behind the mirror, but to this observer, it looks like the light is being emitted behind the observer. And so what the person would actually see is something like this. And this is probably not too foreign to any of our experiences. We've all looked in mirrors-- and remember, this is the left side of this book-- oh, sorry. This is the right side of the book. It's the side that has the curvy part of the B so it'll look like this. So what this observer sees is an image that looks like this. It is what people call the mirror image. It is flipped. The left and the right is flipped and you can think about why that is. I could just draw another ray right here to make it clear. If this ray is coming like this. Now, it will reflect and come out back like this to this observer it came from that point right over there. So he sees a flipped version of the book. Now the whole reason why I did this is one, just to make you feel a little comfortable with these reflecting lines and all of that. But one, I guess more importantly to get you more comfortable with the idea of a virtual image. This right here is a virtual image and we're going to compare it with a real image in the next video. And to some degree, a virtual image is more intuitive because we have so much experience with it when we think about mirrors or reflective surfaces. So it's a virtual image. And we call it a virtual image because the book really isn't there. It's virtually there. There is no actual physical space, or we don't know if there's any physical space behind the image. Our brain just uses these diverging lights and creates a model inside of our brain to say, OK, that book exists there, even though the source of the light is over here. Now I'm just going to draw another diagram, and you normally won't have the diagrams that have this type of perspective, but just to give you a sense of the same thing. And just to get you familiar with some of these diagrams that we're going to do when we study mirrors and lenses, is we could imagine that this is the ground, let's say that this is a mirror. And let's say that this is actually could be somebody standing in front of a mirror. Although usually people will draw an arrow here to just say an arbitrary object, Well, let's just say we have an arrow in front of the mirror, just so you get used to this notation. This is actually a physical arrow, this is not a light ray. Now let's think about what the image of this arrow-- let's say this arrow had eyes, so it's actually a person. So this arrow had eyes, what would this arrow see? Well, let's just pick an arbitrary point of this arrow. You could do it with any point-- this object-- because every point will be reflecting light diffusely. So I'm going to take one point that's coming straight out of the mirror-- one light ray that goes straight to the mirror-- so just parallel to the ground, straight to the mirror. Well, it's just going to reflect straight off and then come back to the source of that light. Maybe that arrow's eye, if you view it as a person. And let's just do another point, another ray coming from that point. So another ray coming from that point might come out like that. Incident angle is equal to reflected angle, so then it would come back like that. Now, maybe this whole thing is an eye. Maybe that'll simplify things. So let's say this whole thing is you're looking really close at a mirror. This whole thing is an eye. Now what would the eye see? Well, it's looking-- this ray looks like it's coming from back over here. And then this ray looks like it's coming from back over here. This is where they converge, so the eye would see this point of the eye over there. So it will actually see itself. And in general, these type of diagrams are used to think about what would the real or virtual image be of an object once the light from that object either is reflected off of a mirror, or goes through some type of lens. And we'll be doing this a lot more in future videos. But anyway, hopefully that gets you a little bit familiar with the things we'll be dealing with.",science_physics_geometric-optics
" -  Regulations require that product labels on containers of food that are available for sale to the public accurately state the amount of food in those containers. Specifically, if milk containers are labeled to have 128 fluid ounces and the mean number of fluid ounces of milk in the containers is at least 128, the milk processor is considered to be in compliance with the regulations. The filling machines can be set to the labeled amount. Variability in the filling process causes the actual contents of milk containers to be normally distributed. A random sample of 12 containers of milk was drawn from the milk processing line in a plant, and the amount of milk in each container was recorded. The sample mean and standard deviation of this sample of 12 containers of milk were 127.2 ounces and 2.1 ounces, respectively. Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that the packaging plant is not in compliance with the regulations? Provide statistical justification for your answer. So pause this video, and see if you can have a go at it. All right, now let's do this together. So first, let's say what we're talking about. So let me define mu. And this is going to be the mean, mean amount, amount of milk in population, population of containers, containers at the plant that we care about. And so then we can set up our hypotheses. Our null hypothesis over here is that we are in compliance. We could say that the mean for our population of containers is actually 128. That's our minimum we need to be in compliance. And then our alternative hypothesis is that we are not in compliance. So that's that our mean, the true population mean, is less than 128 fluid ounces. And so this is a situation where we are not in compliance, not in compliance, compliance in the alternative hypothesis. Now, if you're going to do a significance test, you need to set a significance level. So let's do that over here, significance level. And if you haven't noticed, I'm trying to do, in this video, what would be expected of you on a test. This is an actual question from an AP exam. So our significance level here, I'll just pick it to be 0.05 because, well, that's a fairly typical one. And since they didn't give one to us, it's important to set one ahead of time. And now we want to check our conditions for inference. So let me do that over here, conditions, conditions for inference. And this is to feel good that the sample that we're using to make our inference, to do our significance test, that it's a reasonable one to make inferences from. And so the first one is, are the random condition. And do we need that? Well, they tell us here it's a random sample of 12 containers of milk. If I was doing this on the AP exam, I would write it out here. So I would say, in the passage or in the question, in the question, they say, they say a random, a random sample of 12, and then they go on to say more things. And so I would say that meets condition, meets condition. Now the next one we want to care about is our normal condition, and this is to feel good that our sampling distribution is roughly normal. Now, there's a couple of ways that we could do that. One is if our sample size is greater than 30 or greater than or equal to 30, then we'd say, okay, our sampling distribution's going to be roughly normal. But in this situation, our sample size N, so sample size, sample size is less than 30, but, but there's another way to meet the normal condition. And that's if the underlying parent data is normally distributed. And they actually say it right over here. Variability in the filling process causes the actual contents of milk to be normally distributed. So we could say in passage, in passage says, and let's see, I could quote part of this. So actual contents, actual contents and dot, dot, dot, normally distributed, normally distributed. So that meets condition, meets condition. And then the last condition we want to think about is the independence condition, independence. And this is to feel good that the observations, that the individual observations in our sample can be considered to be roughly independent. Now one way is if they were sampling with replacement, which they're not doing here. Looks like they took all 12 containers at once. But another way is if this is less than 10% of the overall population, then you could say, okay, they're gonna, you could view them as roughly independent. And so you can say didn't, didn't sample with replacement, with replacement, but, but assume, assume that 12 is less than 10% of the population. And in that case, you would meet condition, meet this condition as well. So it looks like we are, we've met these three conditions that we needed to make for inference, or we can assume we've done it. They haven't given us any information to the contrary. And so now, what we can do is calculate a t-statistic and then, from that, calculate our P-value, compare our P-value to our significance level, and see what kind of conclusions we can make. And so our t-statistic right over here, and, once again, if at any point you're inspired and if you haven't done so already, try to do it on your own. Our t-statistic is going to be our sample mean minus the assumed mean from the null hypothesis. And let me, since I'm introducing this notation, this little sub zero, I'll say that's the assumed, assumed mean from my null hypothesis. So I'll do that, and then I'll divide, ideally, if I was doing a z-statistic, I would divide by the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean, which is often known as the standard error of the mean. But the whole reason why I'm doing a t-statistic is, well, I don't know exactly what that is, but I could estimate the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean using the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of n. And once again, it's always good, if you're doing this on a test, to explain what n is or what some of these things are. If you're using standard notation, people might assume what they are, but, if you have time on these tests, you can always explain more of what these actual variables are. But in this case, this is going to be 127.2, that is our sample mean, minus our assumed mean from our null hypothesis, minus 128, all of that over our sample standard deviation is 2.1, divided by the square root of 12. And so this is going to be approximately equal to, get a calculator out here, and so we have, let's see, the numerator, we have 127.2 minus 128. And then we're gonna divide that by, I'll do another parentheses, 2.1 divided by the square root of 12. And then let me close my parentheses. Did I type that in correctly? Yeah, that looks right. Click enter, and so this is negative, I'll say it's approximately negative 1.32. So negative 1.32. And now we can figure out our P-value, our P-value, which is the same thing as the probability of getting a t-statistic this low or lower. So we could say t is less than or equal to negative 1.32, is equal to, so I'll get my calculator back out. And so here, what I would use is I would use the cumulative distribution function for t-statistic. So that's that right over there. And so I do care about the left tail. So I care about the area under the curve from negative infinity up to and including negative 1.32. So let's do negative, negative 1.32. And then my degrees of freedom, well, it's gonna be my sample size minus one. My sample size was 12, so that minus one is 11. And then I do paste. And so I have this tcdf from negative E 99 to negative 1.32 comma 11. And actually, you'd want to write this down on your exam if you were doing it, just so they know where you got that from. And so this is, this is equal to 0.107. So let me write it. This is approximately 0.107. And it's important to say how you calculated this, so used, used tcdf. And we went from negative one 1times 10 to the 99th power. 1And we went up to negative 1.32, 1and then we had 11 degrees of freedom 1to get this result right over here. 1And it also might be good practice 1to draw your t-distribution right over here. 1So that's our t-distribution. 1That's the mean of our t-distribution. 1So we say that this is the area that we care about. 1So that is 1that right over there, 1just to make sure people know what we're talking about. 1And so here, now we're ready to make a conclusion. 1We can compare this to our significance level. 1And so we can say since, 1since 10.107 1is greater than, 1our significance level is greater than 0.05, 1which is alpha, 1we fail, 1we fail 1to reject, 1reject the null hypothesis. 1And so let's just make sure we read their question right. 1Is there sufficient evidence to conclude 1that the packaging plant is not in compliance 1with the regulations? 1And so another way of saying this is there is not, 1there is not 1sufficient, 1sufficient, I'm gonna have to scroll down a little bit. 1I'm trying to squeeze it on the page, but 1I'm gonna have to go down. 1There is not 1sufficient evidence, 1sufficient evidence to conclude, 1to conclude 1that 1the plant 1is not 1in compliance with regulations. 1And then we are done.",math_ap-statistics_tests-significance-ap
" Write 6 times 6 times 6 times 6 times 6 times 6 times 6 times 6 in exponential notation. So what's going on over here? Well, we have 6 multiplied by itself how many times? Let's see, that's 6 times 1, then 6 times 2 is that. That's 6 times-- well, it's not 6 times 2. It's 6 times itself two times. Remember, 6 times itself two times would be 36. 6 times 2 would only be 12. So we have one 6, two 6, three 6, four 6, five 6's, six 6's, seven 6's, eight 6's. So we're multiplying 6 by itself eight times. To write this in exponential notation, we would say that this is equal to 6 to the eighth power, which is literally equal to 6 times 6 times 6 times 6 times 6 times 6 times 6 times 6. Now, I want to make it very clear this is NOT, this is NOT, this is NOT equal to 6 times 8. 6 times 8 will only be 48. 6 to the eighth power is a super huge number. 6 times 6 is 36, and you're going to multiply that times 6, which is what? That's like 36 times-- that's what? 216, and you keep multiplying it by 6, you get some huge number here. This number right here. It's worthwhile to point out this number is huge. This number right here, not so huge. It is not huge. So don't get confused.

" -  Alright, now let's tackle part c. Use quantitative reasoning, including equations as needed, to develop an expression for the new final position of the block. Express your answer in terms of D. Alright, I'm gonna set up a little table here for part c. Oops, sorry about that. Sometimes my pen is not functioning properly. Alright so part c. Let me set up two scenarios. So I have scenario one. Scenario one, where we compress the spring, our delta x is equal to d, and then we have scenario two, scenario two, where we compress the spring by twice as much, is equal to two d, and let me set up my table now, so, just like that and like this, and let's just think about a few things. So the first thing I wanna think about is the potential energy, so the potential energy when the spring is compressed. So potential energy when spring compressed. When, I'll just write compressed, when compressed. Well in this scenario I'll call it the potential energy for scenario one, it's equal to one half times the spring constant, times how much we compress it squared. Now what about scenario two? This potential energy is going to be equal to one half times the spring constant, times how much we compress it, it's now twice as much, squared, well this is equal to one half times the spring constant, times four d squared, and I can out the four up front, this is equal to four times one half, four times one half, times our spring constant, times d squared, which is equal to four times the potential energy when we just compress the spring by d. So we already see a little bit of what we talked about in part b, you compress your spring twice as much, you're going to have four times the potential energy, because the potential energy doesn't grow proportionately with how much you compress it, it grows with the square of how much you compress it. Alright, now let's think about kinetic energy Kinetic energy when x is equal to zero, so right when the spring, when we lose contact with the spring, the spring is no longer pushing on the block, well our kinetic energy is going to be equal to what our potential energy was when the spring was actually compressed. Another way of thinking about it, all that potential energy has now been turned into kinetic energy. Now what about over here? Well, the kinetic energy in this scenario, like we just saw before, that's gonna be equal to the potential energy when the spring was compressed. All of that potential energy gets turned into kinetic energy and this is equal to four times u one, four times the potential energy in scenario one, which is the same thing as four times, which is equal to four times the kinetic energy in scenario one. So we have four times the kinetic energy. Four times kinetic energy, kinetic, kinetic energy. So then we have stopping distance, stopping, stopping distance. We know here this is three d and we know, and then we can say ""What's this?"", this question mark. Well let's just think a little bit about this. We know that if we have that kinetic energy at x equals zero, so we know that k one plus the work done by friction, so let me make it clear, this right over here, that is work done by friction, work done by friction, and it's gonna be negative work cause the force of friction is acting in the direction opposite of the change in x, so the kinetic energy plus the work done by friction is going to be equal to zero. This work cancels out all of this energy. When we think about it, it's turning it all into heat. And so let's think about what the work done by friction is equal to. Well the work done by friction is equal to, is equal to, the coefficient of friction times the mass of the block, times the gravitational field, times how far, over what distance that force, this right over here is the force of friction, times over what distance that force was applied, so times three d. And to be clear, this force is going in the opposite direction of our change in x, so because of that this will be a negative, and so we can say, we can say that the kinetic energy at x equals zero, and now I can just write it as minus mu, the coefficient of friction, times mass, times the gravitational field, times three d is equal to zero. We can add this to both sides and we can get k one is equal to mu times m times g times three d, and if you wanted to solve for distance here, you can divide both sides by the force of friction. So divide both sides by mu times m times g, and you get three d, and I'm just swapping the sides here, is going to be equal to the amount of kinetic energy we have right as x equals zero, divided by mu times m times g and you can just view this as the force of friction. The force, I'll just call it the force of friction right over there. So if you wanna figure out your stopping distance you just figure out your kinetic energy, right when you, right at x equals zero, right when you start entering into the frictiony part of your platform and then you divide that by the force of friction, and that will give you your distance traveled. So the distance here, distance, so I can just put some arrows right over here, our distance is going to be equal to k two divided by the force of, the force of friction. Well k two is equal to four times k one, is equal to four times k one. and our force of friction is going to be the same We have the same coefficient of friction, we have the same mass, we have the same gravitational field, so divided by force of friction, and this we already know, k one divided by force of friction is equal to three d, so this is all going to be equal to four, this is going to be four times three d, three d, which is equal to 12 d, 12 d. So this is all a mathematical way of saying you compress it twice as much, you're going to have four times the potential energy when your spring is compressed, which means you're going to have four times the kinetic energy at x equals zero, which means it is going to take, you're going to have four times the stopping distance, so instead of stopping at three d or in six d as what the student proposed, you are now stopping at 12 d, so that is our stopping distance. Did we answer all of, yeah we answered all of part c. Use quantitative reasoning, including equations as needed, to develop an expression for the new final position of the block. Express your answer in terms of d. Yep, feel good about that.",science_physics_review-for-ap-physics-1-exam
" So we've talked about a lot of vessels here. The main three that we should focus on are these guys right here, the portal vein, the hepatic artery and the common hepatic bile duct. Together these three make what's called the portal triad. It's one of the structures that are very important to identify in surgery and also is seen very commonly in the liver, when we look at smaller cuts of the organ. So if we were to focus in on a smaller section, like that. And blow it up so we can get a better picture of what's going on here. We can see that the liver itself, this giant fatty organ, is split up into smaller pieces or units, that are called hepatic lobules, hepatic lobules. And in the hepatic lobule we'll have a whole bunch of our hepatocytes or single liver cells, that are hanging out, sitting around here. Surrounding these hepatocytes is going to be a representation of our portal triad. That includes a branch that was part of the portal vein. A branch that was part of the hepatic artery and then a branch that will come together to make the common hepatic duct. So those three that make up your portal triad. Now this portal triad isn't found in just one part of the hepatic lobule. In fact, there's a bunch of them that surround the hepatocytes and make this very familiar shape, you might recall from chemistry. So it's this six-sided ring that makes up the hepatic lobule. That has six units of the portal triad surrounding the hepatocytes. And this is how we get nutrient rich blood to enter into the hepatic lobule, so that way these hepatocytes, these liver cells, can extract nutrients for the metabolism or the storage of macro molecules. And of course, hepatocytes are just like any other cell in the body, they need oxygen to survive. And so, oxygen will be carried in from our proper hepatic artery. So we'll supply the hepatocytes with oxygen, we'll supply them with nutrients from these branches off of the portal vein. They're called sinusoids, I'll write that off right here. Sinusoids that come off the portal vein and finally after nutrients have been extracted, oxygens been extracted and we need to send this blood back into the hepatic vein, all of the blood will collect at this very center right here, very conveniently called the central vein. So the central vein that sits in the very middle of our hepatic lobule, will take our nutrient and oxygen poor blood and then coalesce into a hepatic vein that'll be sent off to the heart for oxygenation by the lungs, and then passed by the intestines to receive nutrients from the absorption process we talked about. So that's how our liver works.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" -  Nth partial sum of the series, we're going from one to infinity, summing it a sub n is given by. And they tell us of the formula for some of the first n terms. And they say write a rule for what the actual Nth term is going to be. Now to help us with this, let me just create a little visualization here. So if I have a sub one plus, plus a sub two, plus a sub three, and I keep adding all the way to a sub n minus one plus a sub n. This whole thing, this whole thing that I just wrote out. That is s sub n. This whole thing is s, let me this whole thing is sub n, which is equal to n plus one, over n plus 10. Now if I wanna figure out a sub n, which is the goal of this exercise, well I could subtract out the sum of the first n minus one terms. So I could subtract out this. So that is s, that is s sub n minus one, and what would that be equal to. Well wherever we see an n, we'd replace with an n minus one. So it'd be n minus one plus one over n minus one plus 10, which is equal to n over n plus nine. So if you subtract the red stuff from the blue stuff, all that you're gonna be left with is the thing that we're gonna solve for. You're gonna be left with a sub n. So we could write down a sub n is equal to s sub n, is equal to s sub n minus s sub n minus one S sub n minus one. Or we could write, that is equal to this stuff. So this is the n plus one over n plus 10 minus, minus n over n plus nine. And this by itself, this is a rule for a sub n. But we could combine these terms, add these two fractions together. And this is actually going to be the case for n greater than one. For n equals one, s sub one is going to be, well you can just, a sub one is going to be equal to s sub one. But then for any other n, we could use this right over here. And if we want to simplify this, well we can add these two fractions. We can add these two fractions by having a common denominator. So let's see, if we multiply the numerator and denominator here times n plus nine, we are going to get, this is equal to n plus one times n plus nine, over n plus 10 times n plus nine. And from that, we are going to subtract. Let's multiply the numerator and denominator here by n plus 10. So we have n times n plus 10, over n plus nine times n plus 10. N plus nine times n plus 10. And what does that give us? So, if we simplify up here, we're gonna have, this is n squared plus 10 n plus nine, that's that. And then this right over here this is n squared plus 10 n, within that red color. So this is n squared plus 10 n and remember we're gonna subtract this. And so, and we are close to deserving a drum roll, a sub n is going to be equal to our denominator right over here is n plus nine times n plus 10. And we're gonna subtract the red stuff from the blue stuff. So you subtract an n squared from an n squared and those cancel out. Subtract a 10 n from a 10 n, those cancel out. And you're just left with that blue nine. So there you have it, we've expressed, we've written a rule for a sub n, for n greater than one.",math_calculus-2_cs2-series
" -  Let's say there's some type of standardized exam where every question on the test has four choices, choice A, choice B, choice C, and choice D. And the test makers assure folks that, over many years, there's an equal probability that the correct answer for any one of the items is A, B, C, or D. It essentially is a 25% chance of any of them. Now, let's say you have a hunch that, well, maybe it is skewed towards one letter or another. How could you test this? Well, you could start with a null and alternative hypothesis, and then we can actually do a hypothesis test. So let's say that our null hypothesis is equal distribution, equal distribution of correct choices, correct choices. Or another way of thinking about it is A would be correct 25% of the time, B would be correct 25% of the time, C would be correct 25% of the time, and D would be correct 25% of the time. Now, what would be our alternative hypothesis? Well, alternative hypothesis would be not equal distribution, not equal distribution. Now, how are we going to actually test this? Well, we've seen this show before, at least the beginnings of the show. You have the population of all of your potential items here, and you could take a sample. And so let's say we take a sample of 100 items. So n is equal to 100. And let's write down the data that we get when we look at that sample. So this is the correct choice, correct choice. And then this would be the expected number that you would expect. And then this is the actual number. And if this doesn't make sense yet, we'll see it in a second. So there's four different choices, A, B, C, D and a sample of 100. Remember, in any hypothesis test, we start assuming that the null hypothesis is true. So the expected number where A is a correct choice would be 25% of this 100. So you would expect 25 times the A to be the correct choice, 25 times B to be the correct choice, 25 times C to be the correct choice, and 25 times D to be the correct choice. But let's say our actual results, when we look at these 100 items, we get that A is the correct choice 20 times, B is the correct choice 20 times, C is the correct choice 25 times, and D is the correct choice 35 times. So if you just look at this, just look, hey, maybe there's a higher frequency of D, but maybe you'd say, well, this is just a sample. And just through random chance, it might have just gotten more Ds than not. There's some probability of getting this result, even assuming that the null hypothesis is true. And that's the goal of these hypothesis tests, is say what's the probability of getting a result at least this extreme? And if that probability is below some threshold, then we tend to reject the null hypothesis and accept an alternative. And those thresholds you have seen before. We've seen these significance levels. Let's say we set a significance level of 5%, 0.05. So if the probability of getting this result or something even more different than what's expected is less than the significance level, then we'd reject the null hypothesis. But this all leads to one really interesting question. How do we calculate a probability of getting a result this extreme or more extreme? How do we even measure that? And this is where we're going to introduce a new statistic and also, for many of you, a new Greek letter, and that is the capital Greek letter chi, which might look like an X to you. But it's a little bit curvier, and you could look up more on that. You kind of curve that part of the X. But it's a chi, not an X. And the statistic is called chi-squared, and it's a way of taking the difference between the actual and the expected and translating that into a number. And the chi-squared distribution is, well, I really should say distributions are well studied. And we can use that to figure out what is the probability of getting a result this extreme or more extreme? And if that's lower than our significance level, we reject the null hypothesis, and it suggests the alternative. But how do we calculate the chi-squared statistic here? Well, it's reasonably intuitive. What we do is, for each of these categories, in this case, it's for each of these choices, we look at the difference between the actual and the expected. So for choice A, we'd say 20 is the actual minus the expected. And then we're going to square that. And then we're going to divide by what was expected. And then we're going to do that for choice B. So we're going to say the actual was 20, expected is 25, so 20 minus 25 squared, over the expected, over 25. Plus then we do that for choice C. 25 minus 25, we know where that one will end up, squared, over the expected, over 25. And then finally, for choice D, which is going to get us 35 minus 25 squared, all of that over 25. And we are now, let's see, if we calculate this, this is going to be negative five squared. So that's going to be 25. This is going to be 25. This is going to be zero. 35 minus 25 is 10, squared, that is 100. So this is one plus one, plus zero, plus four. So our chi-squared statistic, in this example, came out nice and clean, this won't always be the case, at six. So what do we make of this? Well, what we can do is then look at a chi-squared distribution for the appropriate degrees of freedom, and we'll talk about that in a second, and say what is the probability of getting a chi-squared statistic six or larger? And to understand what a chi-squared distribution even looks like, these are multiple chi-squared distributions for different values for the degrees of freedom. And to calculate the degrees of freedom, you look at the number of categories. In this case, we have four categories, and you subtract one. Now, that makes a lot of sense because, if you knew how many As, Bs, and Cs there are, if you knew the proportions, even the assumed proportions, you can always calculate the fourth one. That's why it is four minus one degrees of freedom. So in this case, our degrees of freedom are going to be equal to three. Over here, sometimes you'll see it described as k, so k is equal to three. So if we look at, that's that little light blue, so we're looking at this chi-squared distribution where the degree of freedom is three. And we want to figure out what is the probability of getting a chi-squared statistic that is six or greater? So we would be looking at this area right over here. And you could figure it out using a calculator, or, if you're taking some type of a test, like an AP Statistics exam, for example, you could use their tables they give you. And so a table like this could be quite useful. Remember, we're dealing with the situation where we have three degrees of freedom. We had four categories, so four minus one is three. And we got a chi-squared value. Our chi-squared statistic was six. So this right over here tells us the probability of getting a 6.25 or greater for our chi-squared value is 10%. If we go back to this chart, we just learned that this probability from 6.25 and up, when we have three degrees of freedom, that this right over here is 10%. Well, that's 10%. Then the probability, the probability of getting a chi-squared value greater than or equal to six is going to be greater than 10%, greater than 10%. And we could also view this as our P-value. And so for our probability, assuming the null hypothesis is greater than 10%, well, it's definitely going to be greater than our significance level. And because of that, we will fail to reject, fail to reject. And so this is an example of, even though in your sample, you just happened to get more Ds, the probability of getting a result at least as extreme as what you saw is going to be a little bit over 10%.",math_statistics-probability_inference-categorical-data-chi-square-tests
" -  Part d, given that f of one is equal to three, write an expression for f of x that involves an integral. It says it involves an integral. We can assume it's going to involve f prime. Thus you can see given us so much information about f prime including its graph and the area under or above the curve of the different integrals. And it wanted us to find f of four and f of negative two. So let's think about how we can connect f prime, an integral and f of x. Well, if we have the integral from a to b of f prime of x, dx. What is this going to be equal to? Well, this is going to be equal to the antiderivative of f prime of x which is f of x. And we're going to evaluate that at b and a and subtract the difference. So this is going to be f of b minus f of a. This is straight out of the fundamental theorem of calculus. All right, well this is interesting. Well, what if, instead of having a b, what if we had an x there? And if we're going to put an x as one of our bounds of integration, well, we'll use a different variable for our integration here. So let me write it this way. So find the integral from a to x of f prime of u, du. Well, what is this going to be equal to? Well, this is going to be, by the same logic, the antiderivative of this evaluated with x, so f of x minus f of a, minus f of a. Or, if we wanted to solve for f of x, we could add f of a to bought sides and we would get f of x is equal to the integral from a to x of f prime of u, du. Once again, I wanted the u one. This is some letter other than x since I already used x as one of my bounds of integration. And I'm adding f of a to both sides. I swapped the sides too. So f of x is going to be equal to this plus f of a. Plus f of a. So this is a general form if a is a lower bound but they gave us some information. They said that f of one, f of one is equal to three. So if we choose a to be equal to one, if we say this is one right over here. This is one. Then we know that this is going to be equal to three. So we can write f of x, f of x is equal to the integral. I'm using one as my a since I know what f of one is. From one to x of f prime of u, du, plus f of one, they told us what that is. That is going to be equal to three. So this is the first part right here. This is it. That is the first part of the problem. Now, let's try to find f of four and f of negative two. All right, f of four. Well, whenever see an x, we substitute to four. There's gonna be integral from one to four of f prime of u, du plus three. So, what is gonna be the integral from one to four of f prime of u, du? So let's look up here. So the integral from one to four of f prime, that's the curve right over here. Well, that's going to give this area but it's going to be the negative of the area because it's the, if you just take the integrals, it's the area that you could view above the x-axis and below where for the intervals of u, above the u axis and below the function. Well, this is the other way around. The function is below the horizontal axis here. So this area, which they told us in the problem, the area bound by the x-axis in the graph of f prime over the interval one, four is 12. So this area over here is 12 but the integral is going to be a negative because, once again, our function is below the x-axis. So this integral, this right over here is going to be a negative 12. This is negative 12. So negative 12 plus three is negative nine. All right, now let's evaluate f of negative two. F of negative two is equal to the integral from one to negative two of f prime of u, du plus three. Well, it's kind of feels a little strange to have the upper bound to being lower than the lower bound. So we could swap the bounds and then add a negative about here. So this is going to be equal to the negative of, if we swap the bounds here. So from negative two to one, f prime of u, du plus three. So that's the integral from negative to the one. Well, they gave us that. From negative two to one. They told us that this area over here is nine. But once again, because it's below the horizontal axis and above the curve, we would say that the integral would evaluate to be negative nine. So the area is nine. But once again, the curve is below the x-axis. So the integral would give us negative nine. This would evaluate to negative nine. So take the negative of negative nine which is positive nine plus three which is equal to, so nine plus three is equal to 12, and we're done.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-solved-exams
" We had talked a little bit about the resistance equation that we got from Dr. Poiseuille. And the equation looked a little bit like this. Actually, let me just replace this. We had 8 times eta, which was the viscosity of blood times the length of a vessel divided by pi times the radius of that vessel to the fourth power. And all this put together gives us the resistance in a vessel. So thinking about this a little bit more, let's assume for the moment that the blood viscosity is not going to change. It certainly won't change from moment to moment, but let's say that, in general, blood viscosity is pretty constant. Now, given that, if I want to change the resistance, then I have two variables left. I've got the length of my vessel and I've got the radius. So if I have a vessel-- like this-- and let's say it's got a certain radius and length. And let's say that radius is r, and the length is here. And I apply a number. Let's say the number is 2 for the resistance. Well, I have two options for changing that resistance. If I want to increase the resistance, I can do two things. So let's say I want to increase that resistance. And you can look at the equation and tell me what the answer would be. Two things. And I'll actually draw it out. So one thing would be to keep the radius basically the same, but make it much longer. Because if I make it longer, since the L is now, let's say, twice as long and r is the same, now my resistance is going to double. So now we go 2 times. And 2 times 2 is 4. So my resistance is 4. OK. Option 2. Let's say I don't want to change the length. I keep the length the same. Instead, I could actually maybe change the radius. And let's say I half the radius. I make it half of what it was. And I actually worked out the math in the last one. And it turned out that, if you half the radius-- in the last video, that is-- then the resistance actually is 16 times higher. And you can see that because the resistance equals r to the fourth power here. So because r is to the fourth power when you half it, it goes 16-fold. And so 16 times 2 is 32. So our resistance is 32. So these are the two strategies, if you think of it that way, that a blood vessel can use to increase resistance. And of the two, you can see that one of them is definitely more effective. I mean, I can see that because it's raised to the fourth power, this is going to work much more effectively to raise the resistance than changing the length. And additionally, if you think of it kind of from a practical standpoint, keep in mind that I have smooth muscle. So it's actually pretty easy to accomplish this-- or at least possible to accomplish this. Whereas trying to actually change the length-- which is option 1-- is not feasible. I mean, it's much, much more complicated to actually expect a vessel to simply double in its length because it wants to raise the resistance. So for multiple reasons, changing radius, again, becomes the name of the game. OK. So let's complicate this a little bit. Let's say instead of one vessel, I've got three vessels. I've got, let's say, one vessel here. And there's, let's say, 5. And then I've got, let's see, a longer vessel here. And this one happens to have a resistance of, let's say, 8 because it's longer. And let's do the same radius for all these, but shorter now. This one is 2. And I want blood to flow through all three of these. What is my total resistance? And here we're talking about the three vessels being in a series-- meaning that you actually expect the blood to go through all three of the vessels or tubes. So if they're going to go through all three tubes, what you have to do is simply add up the total. So resistance total-- so this is total resistance. And I just put a little t to remind me that that means total. So total resistance equals the resistance of one part plus the second part plus the third part. And if you had a fourth or fifth part, you just keep adding them up. So in this case, you have 5, 8, and 2. So Rt becomes 5 plus 8 plus 2, and that equals 15. So total resistance would be 15. And actually, I'm going to give you a general rule. Total resistance is always, always greater than any component. And you can see how this is very intuitive. I mean, how could you possibly have a situation where-- if you're just simply adding them up, because we don't expect any negative resistance in this situation. You're simply adding up all these positive resistances. Of course, the total will be always greater than any one component. Seems intuitive, but I just wanted to spell that out. So now, let's take a scenario where you have a human body, a vessel in the body. And let's say you have three parts to it, and these are equal parts. So let's say the resistance here is 2, 2, and 2. Obviously, I want to calculate-- as before-- my total. So my total will be 2 plus 2 plus 2, which is 6. And then, an interesting thing happens. So you have, let's say-- I'll draw the same vessel again. A really interesting thing happens. This is the same blood vessel, but now you have a blood clot. And this blood clot is floating through the blood vessels. And it kind of makes its way to this one that we're working with. And it goes and lodges right here. So right here you have a lodged blood vessel. Wow. That's pretty big, but it's right in that middle third of our vessel. So we have now a tiny little radius here. It's about, let's say, half of what we had before. The new radius equals half of what the old radius was. And you know from the last example that's going to increase the resistance in that part by 16. So the resistance here stays at 2. Here it stays at 2. But here in the middle, it goes from 2 to 32 because it's 16 times greater. So you end up increasing the resistance in the middle section by a lot. So let me just write that out for you. So 2 times 16 gets us to 32. So here the resistance is 32. And so if I wanted to calculate the total resistance, I'd get something like this-- 32 plus 2 plus 2 is 36. So I actually went from 6 to 36 when this blood clot came and clogged up part of that vessel. So just keep that in mind. We'll talk about that a little bit more, but I just wanted to use this example and also kind of cement the idea of what you do with resistance in a series. Let's contrast that to a different situation. And this is when you have resistance in parallel. So instead of asking blood to either kind of go through all of my vessels, I could also do something like this-- I could say, well, let's say, I have three vessels again. And this time, I'm going to change the length and the radius. And let's say this one's really big. And the resistance here, let's say, is 5, here is 10, and here is 6. So you've got three different resistances. And the blood now can choose to go through any one of these paths. It doesn't have to go through all three. So how do I figure out now what the total resistance is? So what is the total resistance? Well, the total resistance this time is going to be 1 over 1 R1, plus 1 over R2, plus 1 over R3. And you can go on and on just as before. But in this case, we only have three. So let's just put that there, that there, and that there. And I can figure this out pretty easily. So I can say 1 over 1 over 6 plus 1 over 10 plus 1/5. And the common denominator there is 30. So I could say 5/30. This is 3/30, and this would be 6/30. And adding that up together, I get 1 over 14/30 or 30 over 14, which is 2 and let's say 0.1. So 2.1. So the total resistance here is 2.1. Putting all three of these together is pretty interesting. And I want you to realize that the resistance in total 1is actually less than any component part. 1So unlike before where we said that the total resistance is 1greater than any component, here an interesting feature 1is that you have total resistance 1is always less than any component. 1So a pretty cool set of rules that we can kind of go forward 1with.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system
" SAL KHAN: I'm here with the Dr. Laura Bachrach at Stanford Medical School. And what are we going to talk about? DR. LAURA BACHRACH: We're going to talk about normal and abnormal growth in children. SAL KHAN: Fascinating. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So this is an important concern. Parents really worry if their child is growing normally. And physicians worry about this too, because the change in height is an important barometer of how the child is doing overall, in terms of health. So to begin to assess the child's growth pattern, we have to think about what are the determits of where the child should be on the growth curve. The number one most important determit, of course, is genetics. Short parents are more likely to have short children and vice versa. SAL KHAN: And that's true even when a child is young, because sometimes I've seen the opposite. So people who are petite have large children and all the rest. But it is true that, if someone is large, they're more likely to have large children, even infants and toddlers. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: You've hit upon a really important issue that's shown here in this slide. The size of a baby at birth isn't necessarily going to reflect the genetics. There are babies that are born small, because mother didn't have prenatal care. Mother was a smoker, other factors that compromise the growth of the child. And those babies can be born small for their gestational age. During the first two to three years of life, they have a chance to catch up on the curve and reach what's called their genetic potential. SAL KHAN: So let's just make sure. I want to make sure. I've seen these curves before, when I went to visit a pediatrician, even I remember this when I used to visit the pediatrician, which I did maybe a little too long. So this axis right over here is age. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: In months. SAL KHAN: In months-- so this is right here birth. This is birth. So if a baby is born at-- I don't know. This is the weight right over here. So if a baby is born at five pounds-- is this in pounds? This is kilograms. OK, so five pounds is right over. Is that right? Yeah, five pounds would be right over here. So this would be a baby born at five pounds. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right. And I'm talking more here, during this growth lecture, about the height or length of the baby, throughout babyhood and childhood. But let's say, the baby were born light in weight and short in length. SAL KHAN: So maybe 18 inches right here would be a short length. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right, and let's say, that baby was small because his mother had issues during the pregcy. SAL KHAN: Is it always the case that the baby will be small because of issues? DR. LAURA BACHRACH: No. The bottom line is that genetics plays less of a part in the size of the baby at birth than it will later on in childhood. SAL KHAN: All right, it makes sense. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So to come back to your point, you'll meet parents whose baby seem to be larger or smaller than they are. But by age three the child should be-- SAL KHAN: Hold on one second. Let me just close this. OK. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: By age three, the child should be in his or her genetic groove, if you will. SAL KHAN: I see. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So there can be movement on the growth curve in the first two to three years of life. There can be catch-up growth, where the child, who was small, let's say, moves from below the curve up to the 50th percentile, by age 24 months. SAL KHAN: So this would be a child who does something like this. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Exactly, exactly. And you can have the converse, where you have a very big baby. Let's say, mother had uncontrolled diabetes, and the baby was born very large. That baby can have catch-down growth, to the 50th percentile. By the age of three, certainly movement across percentiles is considered to be abnormal and warrants an investigation. SAL KHAN: So you really can predict someone's even adult height, based on where they at three? DR. LAURA BACHRACH: A general rule of thumb is, that by age 2 and 1/2 to 3, the child is in their genetic groove. SAL KHAN: Really? Oh, wow. I didn't realize that quickly you can kind of-- so if a child, at age three or four, is in the 25th percentile in height, it's unlikely that they're going to be in the NBA? DR. LAURA BACHRACH: In general, that's true. There are a few exceptions. There are late bloomers, what we call a constitutional delay of growth. But a general rule would be, what percentile you are by the age of two or three is pretty much where you're going to track, if all things are going normally. SAL KHAN: Wow, I never realized that it was that soon. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And genetics is an important determit as I said. We can actually do a calculation of where we think a child should end up, the so-called mid-parental height, which we are going to talk about later. So genetics is the critical factor. But whether or not you reach your genetic potential means that the cards have to be lined up appropriately. So the cards that are important for achieving your genetic potentials, first of all, number one-- normal amounts of hormones that are important for growing. And those are thyroid and growth hormone, to a large extent. A second factor, of course, is adequate nutrition. And we think worldwide of children who are undernourished, who don't look anywhere near their age, in terms of height, because they're so undernourished. It really cramps their style. SAL KHAN: And you see the reverse of that. I mean, I don't know what I am officially. I was born here. My parents weren't. So I'm what, first generation or second generation. But you see that in that, is that you see a lot of people in my generation are much taller than their parents, because their parents were probably malnourished in some way. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Certainly, there can be a secular trend, where the children get taller than the parents, if the children have a different environment. The other thing we notice about nutrition in our country is the over-nutrition of our children. And what happens with obesity is that children may grow faster, in terms of both weight and height for their age. They don't end up taller in the long run. But they move ahead more quickly through the maturation process. SAL KHAN: I see. I didn't know. OK, it can accelerate. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Exactly. SAL KHAN: I never realized that. That's fascinating. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And then we think about psychosocial factors. There literally is a situation where infants can be deprived of parental love and support, and you see something dwarfing there. In a teenager, we see problems with eating disorders, that's a cross between nutrition and a psychological problem. So psychosocial factors play a role as well. SAL KHAN: So they've shown, or it's been seen that it's noticeable changes in physical development, based on, I guess, attention and love. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Yes, there's actually a syndrome called psychosocial dwarfism, where you can actually see a slow down in growing without adequate interpersonal support. SAL KHAN: Wow, that's fascinating. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So the issue is, when do you need to worry about a child's growth pattern? In order to interpret that, you have to understand about the variability in growth. In the first two to three years of life, children grow much more quickly than they will later on. By the age of three, until they hit puberty, children should grow two inches a year. SAL KHAN: Two inches a year, this is from the ages of-- DR. LAURA BACHRACH: After they're out of toddlerhood until they hit puberty. SAL KHAN: So this is like three to puberty. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Exactly, exactly. But when kids will hit puberty is going to be variable. And so that's an issue. If children are growing at a normal rate, it's not necessary to memorize the inches per year. Children will track along the growth curve. And if we can turn to the next slide or next graph, this is a graph for what we use for older children, after the age of 2 up until they're 18. This is the curve that we use. Now, beyond the age of two, I said to you, it's not normal for children to necessarily cross percentiles. So if, for example, you have a child who is tracking along the fifth percentile every year, growing their two inches a year. SAL KHAN: This is the fifth down here? DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right, the lower line there. They're moving along, steadily, steadily, steadily. That child has a more reassuring growth curve than one, for example, who as a five-year-old had been at the top of the curve. SAL KHAN: Right, a five-year-old. So five-year-old is right there. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And then the next year is on the 75th moving down a line. SAL KHAN: I see. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And the year after is on the 50th percentile. Now, at that point in time, the child has theoretically a normal height because it's within the curve. But there's something very abnormal about that rate of growing. And that's the child that's more worrisome than the shorter child. SAL KHAN: Fascinating. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So bottom line, when a child would come in to present to me because of a concern about growing, I'd first of all try to decide if they're are short and if they're growing normally. And those are two different questions. The first question is, are they short? And are they short can be defined by looking at these curves. These are curves representing the spectrum of normal height for a healthy American youth. And they go from the 5th to the 95th percentile. So you can compare a child to the population as a whole. But I also like to calculate what we call the mid-parental height. OK, this is where we take into account the heights of the parents, because that's the most important determit. So how we calculate that is as follows. We take the height of mom and dad and average them. SAL KHAN: OK, let's do that. So I'm 5' 9"", if I'm wearing decent shoes. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK. SAL KHAN: So set that to 69 inches. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK. And how tall is the mother of your children? SAL KHAN: She's 5' 6"". DR. LAURA BACHRACH: She's 5' 6"". SAL KHAN: Which is why I don't let her wear too large heels. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK. And are we trying to calculate your son or your daughter? SAL KHAN: Let's do my son, since he's a little older. So let's see, it's plus 66 inches. DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK. So we'll take the midpoint of that. SAL KHAN: OK, so that's really an inch and 1/2. So it's what, 67 and 1/2 inches between me and my wife. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right. 1And we're going to add 2 and 1/2 inches. 1SAL KHAN: OK. 1So that gets us what, to exactly 70 inches. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right. 1And that's the height prediction for your son. 1SAL KHAN: Oh, very good. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Plus or minus-- 1SAL KHAN: Oh, plus or minus. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: 4 inches. 1SAL KHAN: Plus or minus 4 inches, 1oh, that's a big difference. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: It's a big difference. 1But that's the nature of human variability. 1SAL KHAN: I see. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK. 1Now, if this were your daughter, we 1would take the 67 and 1/2 inches and subtract 2 and 1/2 inches. 1Let's do that. 1SAL KHAN: OK, so that gets us 65, so 5' 5"" 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Exactly, plus or minus 4 inches. 1SAL KHAN: Plus or minus 4 inches. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So that's something we do. 1We then calculate-- in fact, let's plot that, 1right on the curve. 1This is the boys' curve, so let's plot the 70 inches. 1SAL KHAN: 70 inches is right over here, OK. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: And then the range of 74. 1SAL KHAN: 74 to 66. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Right, exactly-- pretty broad range. 1SAL KHAN: Yes. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: OK. 1But if we had a child who was growing well below the curve 1and we thought the midpoint should 1be about the 50th percentile, that child 1would be short for the family. 1So we always like to take the family heights into account. 1So number one question, is the child's short? 1It will depend on what the height prediction is. 1SAL KHAN: I see. 1So if my son was tracking down here at the 5%. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: That would be concerning. 1SAL KHAN: Even if he's growing the two inches every year 1and he's tracking that, it still would be concerning. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Well, it would raise some questions 1in our minds. 1But that's the more important factor is not just 1where they on the curve at the moment. 1But are they growing at the normal rate? 1And the child who is not growing at the normal rate 1raises more red flags than the child 1who's trotting up the curve. 1SAL KHAN: Fascinating. 1That's interesting, wow. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: So that's the issue. 1And that's what we approach every day. 1We want to look into the various causes, 1potentially, for growth slowdown. 1We want to address treatment to the specific etiology. 1SAL KHAN: And etiology means-- 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: Well, for example, 1if the child has a deficiency of thyroid hormone, 1we want to give thyroid hormone back. 1SAL KHAN: So etiology is like the cause. 1DR. LAURA BACHRACH: The cause. 1If the child isn't growing because he has a nutritional 1problem, like Celiac Disease, we want 1to put him on a special diet to address that issue. 1Some parents think, well, what we 1want to do-- my child is healthy and normal and growing 1normally, but I want to give him some growth hormone. 1That becomes a topic in itself. 1SAL KHAN: Right, very good. 1Well, thank you for this. 1This was super informative.",science_health-and-medicine_healthcare-misc
" Deflation is literally just a lowering of prices, or a general decrease in the level of prices for goods and services. Or another way to think about it, since inflation is an increase in the level of prices, you can just view it as negative inflation. And so, let's say we're the folks at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and we're trying to compute the CPI index. And in one period-- let's call this period one over here-- we have our CPI index for urban consumers. And that's the one that's quoted most often. And we have this basket of goods. And it'll have housing in it. Let me write that a little bit neater. It'll have housing in it. It'll have transportation in it. It'll have a fuel in it. It might have some proxy for entertainment or whatever else inside of it. And that basket of goods, let's say in period one-- and this is a simplification-- runs that urban consumer on average $100. And then we go to period two, and we look at that same basket of goods. Maybe we're adjusting certain things, maybe some products have become obsolete and we have to replace, or there has to be some adjustments for technology. And that's all under debate, how you should adjust them. But given that, assuming everything else is equal, that same basket of goods is now running at $98. And so the total cost of goods and services for this kind of average consumer has gone down by $2. Or we could say that we've experienced negative 2% inflation, which is really just another way of saying that we have experienced deflation. Now, deflation is not the norm, especially for growing economies, the way that our current economic systems runs, although it does happen. And Japan in particular is probably the most recent, most famous case of deflation. And the main reason why economists really don't like deflation-- or I should say in particular, while central bankers really don't like deflation-- is that it makes it much harder to control the economy or to fuel the economy with interest rates alone, or actually just with printing money alone. And I'll go into a little bit more depth with that in future videos. One thing I do want to make clear is although deflation isn't what we normally see in the broader economy as a whole, it does happen very frequently in specific sectors. And the most common one is in the technology sector, specifically hardware. We've all experienced buying a laptop at one period-- so right now you buy the laptop for maybe $1,000-- and then six months later you see that exact same laptop for $500. And that's just because the rate of technological innovation is going so fast that they can produce the same amount of memory and processing power for a lot cheaper now. Or for the same amount of money you can get much more memory and processing power, and all of the rest. And you see this with laptops and with a big screen TVs and phones and all the rest.",economics-finance-domain_ap-macroeconomics_economic-iondicators-and-the-business-cycle
" In the video on E2 reactions, I showed you how a strong base-- and all of this happened simultaneously-- a strong base can nab a hydrogen off of this carbon right here. And it's just nabbing the proton itself. It's not grabbing the hydrogen and the electron. And then that electron goes to this carbon right over there, and then that allows that carbon to give away the electron that was forming a bond with the chlorine to go with the chlorine. This all happened at once. The chloride got eliminated. Now, one thing that might pop out in your brain is why did I pick this hydrogen? Why did I pick the hydrogen right over here? Why couldn't I have picked that hydrogen over there? And I'm going to introduce you to a little bit of terminology and then I'll introduce you to a rule. And then I'll tell you a little bit about why people think this rule works. So in general, the carbon that has the functional group on it, that's the alpha carbon. So let me label it. This carbon right here is the alpha carbon. And in order to have an E2 reaction in this case, when we did the video on E2 reactions, but actually, the rule will hold as well for E1 reactions. But in order to have the E2 reaction, the hydrogen has to get swiped off of a beta carbon. And a beta carbon is just a carbon that's one away from the alpha carbon. So this is a beta carbon and this is also a beta carbon. And so it's completely reasonable one would think that, well, I could swipe it from there or I could swipe it from there. And let's think about this reaction. Let's just draw it out, so you can visualize it a little bit better. So here we swiped it from this beta carbon. Let me redraw the reaction where we're swiping it from the other beta carbons. I want both reactions on the screen at the same time. Let me draw our methoxide. So we have our oxygen bonded to a CH3 to a methyl group. The oxygen has seven valence electrons: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I'll do the seventh one. The one that will bond with the hydrogen, I'll do it in green. Instead of attacking that hydrogen or taking that proton, I should say, because it's not taking the electron with it, it does it to this one. So what it does is it takes this proton or it bonds with that hydrogen proton, and then the hydrogen protons or that hydrogen's electron can then be taken by this molecule, so then it goes to the alpha carbon to form a double bond between this beta carbon and the alpha carbon. And so now, this alpha carbon got that electron. It doesn't need the electron that's bonded with the chloro group anymore, and so that goes to the chlorine to form chloride. Chlorine was already way more electronegative. It was already hogging it. Now it gets to go there. And now, when all is said and done, our products look like this. So we still have the methanol just like we had in the original reaction because this grabbed this hydrogen. Let me draw it. So you have your OCH3. Let me draw all of this in. You have that pair right over there. You have this pair right over here. And then you have this purple electron and now it's bonded with this green electron, which is now on the hydrogen. So it is now bonded with this green electron that has been given to the hydrogen. Oh, and make sure we don't forget. This oxygen over here had seven valence electrons, so it had a negative charge. Neutral oxygen would have six. So this had a negative charge. But now that it gave its electron to this hydrogen, it now has a neutral charge. It is now methanol. Exactly what we saw when we first learned about E1 reactions. We also know the chloro group, it took that electron. It's now a chloride anion. So let me draw that. And that's exactly the same as in the first video on E1 reactions. So it's now a chloride anion. It has grabbed this orange electron. Let me do it in orange. It has grabbed this orange electron, so it now has a negative charge. You can imagine that the negative charge has been transferred from the methoxide to the chloride anion. And now what's different this time is that the double bond is now between the one and the two carbon and not between the two and the three carbon. So now it's going to look like this. So now, the result of this product, if the reaction went this way would look like this. We have this carbon right here. It is bonded to two hydrogens. Now, it has a double bond with this carbon. It has a double bond, and I'll do the second bond. I'll do the pi bond of the double bond in purple right over there. I'll assume that that's the pi bond. That's the new double bond form. And now this carbon, which was the alpha carbon, is right over here. This was the alpha carbon. It's bonded to one hydrogen. And then let me draw everything else. So then you have a carbon, a carbon. This guy is bonded to three hydrogens. I could have just written it as CH3 if I wanted. This guy's bonded to two hydrogens. And we're done. So instead of, as we saw on the first video on E2 reactions, instead of forming but-2-ene, we now have-- it's still one, two, three four carbons, so it's still but-, but the double bond is on the one carbon. We'd start one, two, three, four, So we could call this but-1-ene or 1-butene, either way. So let's call this but-1-ene. So the question is, which is more likely to happen? Do both happen? Does one happen disproportionately? And the answer is, is that, yes, one happens disproportionately. This one, this is the domit product. If you were to perform this reaction and you were to analyze in your beaker or wherever you're performing the reaction what you see most of, the majority product, the great majority, is going to be the but-2-ene, not the but-1-ene. Maybe you see very, very little of this. And the question is why? Or how would you even be able to determine that? Or how could you have predicted that? And to predict it, there's something called Zaitsev's rule. And I'm sure I mispronouncing it, but let me write it down. So Zaitsev's rule. And it's kind of analogous to Markovnikov's rule, but for elimination reactions. If you think about it, the addition reactions that we did many videos ago are the opposite of the elimination reactions. In the addition reactions, we're adding the chloro group, and in the elimination, we're taking it off. And so Zaitsev's rule is kind of analogous to Markovnikov's rule. Now first, I'll just tell you the rule, then we can think a little bit about why it works. The jury's not out on this. They think they know why it works, but they're not 100% sure. So Zaitsev's rules says the carbon that is going to lose the hydrogen is the one that has fewer hydrogens. So let me write it down over here. Carbon more likely to lose hydrogen is-- I should say the hydrogen proton because it keeps the electron still-- is the one with fewer hydrogens. So if you were to look at this reaction right here, we have our alpha carbon. Either this beta carbon or this beta carbon could lose its hydrogen. This one has three hydrogens on it. This one only has two. So Zaitsev's rule tells us that this is the hydrogen, or actually the proton, that is more likely to be reacted with the base. You could almost view it as it is the more acidic proton. It is a lower-hanging fruit for this strong base to capture. Now, a more interesting question-- and that's a pretty easy rule to follow. And if they both have the same number, then you'd see equal products depending on which side it gets. Now the question is why is this happening? And here, something called hyperconjugation comes into effect. I'm not going to go into details in it and to the quantum mechanics of it. And hyperconjugation is the notion that the fact-- so we said that the one with the fewer hydrogens is the one that's less likely to lose. Or the one with fewer hydrogens is the one more likely to lose the hydrogen proton. But the one with fewer hydrogens is also bonded to more carbons. This guy's bonded to one carbon outside of the alpha carbon. He's actually bonded to two: the alpha and this carbon. This guy right here is only bonded to the alpha carbon. And hyperconjugation is the notion that not the beta carbon, but the carbons one over from that help stabilize the double bond that eventually forms. I almost think of it you have more electrons over here because carbons have more electrons to offer than hydrogens. At the end of the day, this guy is more likely able to donate electrons to form from the right-hand side to make a double bond than from the left-hand side. I won't go into the detail of hyperconjugation, but it's all based on the notion that the more stable double bond will be formed if we have other carbons near the double bond. Now, another way to think about is to look at the products. So we saw or Zaitsev's rule tells us that but-2-ene is a more likely product than but-1-ene. And if you look at but-1-ene, we could rewrite it like this. We could draw the double bond like this. 1This carbon is what was the alpha carbon. 1We could draw a carbon right here. 1And then it is bonded to a hydrogen. 1It's bonded to this hydrogen. 1And then it's bonded to just a chain of carbons. 1We'll just write R on that. 1And then this guy is just bonded to two hydrogens. 1Well, this isn't necessarily but-1-ene. 1I just put an R here, but this is how it could be 1represented. 1Now, the but-2-ene, if we wanted to draw it like this 1would look like this. 1We could call this right here R prime. 1It's just a chain of carbons. 1And then we could call this R prime prime. 1It's not even a chain. 1It's just one carbon. 1But if we call it that, then the but-2-ene-- let me draw it 1down here where I have more real estate. 1The but-2-ene would look like this. 1You have your carbon-carbon double bond. 1Now, the left-hand carbon is bonded to a hydrogen, that 1hydrogen right there, and to R prime. 1And the right-hand carbon is bonded to 1hydrogen and R prime prime. 1So it's bonded to a hydrogen and R prime prime. 1All I did here-- let me see if I can fit it all on the same 1screen-- is I just redrew this and I just abstracted away the 1chain as it goes away from the double bond. 1And I did that so that we can look at it this way. 1We can just have the double bond kind of as our focus of 1attention and think about what's going on around it. 1Over here, for the but-1-ene, and we already said this is 1the lesser product, so this is the greater product. 1This is the greater, or the domit product. 1In the lesser product, if we go off of the double bond, we 1only have one alkyl group right there. 1That R right here. 1Over here, we have two. 1And we say that this is more substituted. 1And when w say substituted, you're imagining that you're 1substituting hydrogens with carbon 1chains, with alkyl groups. 1So this one right here is more substituted. 1And hyperconjugation, so the idea would have it, is that 1these carbon chains that are near the double bond help 1stabilize it. 1Some of their sigma electrons and sigma orbitals are there 1to somehow help stabilize the pi orbitals. 1And now this is getting into quantum mechanics and all of 1that, so it's a little bit-- you know, the world isn't 100% 1clear whether that's definitely the mechanism, 1although people have run the experiment, and they know that 1the more substituted product is what you're going to see 1more of as opposed to the less substituted, and that all 1comes from Zaitsev's rule. 1So, hopefully, you at least get Zaitsev's rule. 1The hyperconjugation, that's kind of a deeper concept. 1You know, the jury's not even out on it. 1That's a belief of why Zaitsev's rule works. 1But the rule itself is pretty straightforward. 1If you're trying to pick between two beta carbons, the 1one that's going to lose the hydrogen is the one that 1already has pure hydrogens or the one that's 1bonded to more carbons. 1And this is true. 1I drew it. 1Everything we focused on right now was in an E2 reaction. 1But it's just as true in an E1 reaction.",science_organic-chemistry_substitution-elimination-reactions
" Use the quadratic formula to solve the equation, 0 is equal to negative 7q squared plus 2q plus 9. Now, the quadratic formula, it applies to any quadratic equation of the form-- we could put the 0 on the left hand side. 0 is equal to ax squared plus bx plus c. And we generally deal with x's, in this problem we're dealing with q's. But the quadratic formula says, look, if you have a quadratic equation of this form, that the solutions of this equation are going to be x is going to be equal to negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac-- all of that over 2a. And this is actually two solutions here, because there's one solution where you take the positive square root and there's another solution where you take the negative root. So it gives you both roots of this. So if we look at the quadratic equation that we need to solve here, we can just pattern match. We're dealing with q's, not x's, but this is the same general idea. It could be x's if you like. And if we look at it, negative 7 corresponds to a. That is our a. It's the coefficient on the second degree term. 2 corresponds to b. It is the coefficient on the first degree term. And then 9 corresponds to c. It's the constant. So, let's just apply the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula will tell us that the solutions-- the q's that satisfy this equation-- q will be equal to negative b. b is 2. Plus or minus the square root of b squared, of 2 squared, minus 4 times a times negative 7 times c, which is 9. And all of that over 2a. All of that over 2 times a, which is once again negative 7. And then we just have to evaluate this. So this is going to be equal to negative 2 plus or minus the square root of-- let's see, 2 squared is 4-- and then if we just take this part right here, if we just take the negative 4 times negative 7 times 9, this negative and that negative is going to cancel out. So it's just going to become a positive number. And 4 times 7 times 9. 4 times 9 is 36. 36 times 7. Let's do it up here. 36 times 7. 7 times 6 is 42. 7 times 3, or 3 times 7 is 21. Plus 4 is 25. 252. So this becomes 4 plus 252. Remember, you have a negative 7 and you have a minus out front. Those cancel out, that's why we have a positive 252 for that part right there. And then our denominator, 2 times negative 7 is negative 14. Now what does this equal? Well, we have this is equal to negative 2 plus or minus the square root of-- what's 4 plus 252? It's just 256. All of that over negative 14. And what's 256? What's the square root of 256? It's 16. You can try it out for yourself. This is 16 times 16. So the square root of 256 is 16. So we can rewrite this whole thing as being equal to negative 2 plus 16 over negative 14. Or negative 2 minus-- right? This is plus 16 over negative 14. Or minus 16 over negative 14. If you think of it as plus or minus, that plus is that plus right there. And if you have that minus, that minus is that minus right there. Now we just have to evaluate these two numbers. Negative 2 plus 16 is 14 divided by negative 14 is negative 1. So q could be equal to negative 1. Or negative 2 minus 16 is negative 18 divided by negative 14 is equal to 18 over 14. The negatives cancel out, which is equal to 9 over 7. So q could be equal to negative 1, or it could be equal to 9 over 7. And you could try these out, substitute these q's back into this original equation, and verify for yourself that they satisfy it. We could even do it with the first one. So if you take q is equal to negative 1. Negative 7 times negative 1 squared-- negative 1 squared is just 1-- so this would be negative 7 times 1, right? That's negative 1 squared. Negative 1 times 2 is minus 2 plus 9. So it's negative 7 minus 2, which is negative 9, plus 9, does indeed equal 0. So this checks out. And I'll leave it up to you to verify that 9 over 7 also works out.",math_engageny-alg-1_alg1-module-4
" Solve the equation: x squared minus x squared minus 4 over x minus 2 is equal to 4. And they tell us that x won't or cannot be 2 because if it was 2, then this would be undefined. It would be dividing by 0. So let's see what x is. Let's see the x that actually satisfies this equation. So you might be tempted to try to express this with the common denominator of x minus 2 and then add these two expressions. But the thing that jumps out at me initially is that we have x squared minus 4 on the numerator, which is a difference of squares. Or if you factor it out, it's x plus 2 times x minus 2. So we should be able to factor this x minus 2 out. So let's do that. So if we were to rewrite it, this is equivalent to x squared minus-- instead of writing x squared minus 4, we know that's a difference of squares. That is x plus 2 times x minus 2. All of that over x minus 2. And that is equal to 4. And this whole time we're assuming that x won't be equal to 2. And because x does not equal to 2, x minus 2 divided by x minus 2 is going to be defined. And it will be 1. So those two will cancel out. And so we're left with x squared minus x plus 2 is equal to 4. We can distribute the negative sign. And I'll just arbitrarily switch colors here. We can distribute the negative sign, so we get x squared minus x minus 2 is equal to 4. And what we want to do is put this in the form ax squared plus bx plus c is equal to 0. That allows us to either factor it or apply the quadratic equation or complete the square, or any of the ways that we know how to solve quadratics. So let's do that. Let's get a 0 on the right-hand side. The best way to do that is to subtract 4 from both sides of this equation. Subtract 4 and we are left with x squared minus x. Negative 2 minus 4 is negative 6. And then 4 minus 4 is 0. That was the whole point. So we have x squared minus x minus 6 is equal to 0. Let me write it up here. x squared minus x minus 6 is equal to 0. And this looks factorable. We just have to think of two numbers that when we multiply them give us negative 6. So they're going to have different signs. When I add them I'll get negative 1. So it looks like negative 3 and positive 2 work. So if we do x minus 3 times x plus 2. It's a little bit of trial and error, but 6 doesn't have that many factors to deal with and 3 and 2 are one apart. They have different signs, so that's how you can think of how we get to that conclusion. Negative 3 times 2 is negative 6. Negative 3 plus 2 is negative 1. So that is equal to 0. So we have two possible ways to get 0. Either x minus 3 is equal to 0 or x plus 2 is equal to 0. And then if we take x minus 3 is equal to 0, if we add 3 to both sides of that equation, we get x is equal to 3 or, if we subtract 2 from both sides of this equation, we get x is equal to negative 2. So both of these are solutions. And let's apply them into this equation to make sure that they work. Because these are solutions to essentially, the situation where we got rid of the x minus 2. Maybe it had some type of side effects. So let's just make sure that both of these actually work in the original equation. So let's try x is equal to 3 first. So you get 3 squared minus 3 squared over 4. Sorry, 3 squared minus 4 over 3 minus 2. So this is equal to 9 minus-- 3 squared is 9 --minus 4, which is 5, over 1. So 9 minus 5, which is equal to 4. Which is exactly what we needed it to equal. And let's try it with negative 2. So if I take negative 2 squared and I have a minus negative 2 squared minus 4, all of that over negative 2 minus 2. So negative 2 squared is 4. Minus negative 2 squared, which is 4. Minus 4. All of that over negative 2 minus negative 2 over negative 4. Well 4 minus 4 is 0, so this whole thing is just going to become 0. So this whole thing is going to equal 4. So both of these solutions work. And that makes sense, because when we actually canceled this out, we actually didn't fundamentally change anything about the equation. Only if you had the situation where the x would have been equal to 2. That's the only thing that you're really changing. So that's why it makes sense that both of these solutions work.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-1
" -  What I wanna do in this video is see if we can find the measure of angle D, if we could find the measure of angle D and like always, pause this video, and see if you can figure it out. And I'll give you a little bit of a hint. It'll involve thinking about how an inscribed angle relates to the corresponding to the measure of the arc that it intercepts. So, think about it like that. All right, so, let's work on this a little bit. So, what do we know, what do we know? Well, angle D, angle D intercepts an arc. It intercepts this fairly large arc that I'm going to highlight right now in this purple color. So, it intercepts that arc. We don't know the measure of that arc or at least we don't know the measure of that arc yet. If we did know the measure of this arc that I'm highlighting, then we know that the measure of angle D would just be half that because the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc that it intercepts. We've seen that multiple times. So, if we knew the measure of this arc, we would be able to figure out what the measure of angle D is. But we do know, we don't know the measure of that arc, but we do know the measure of another arc. We do know the measure of the arc that completes the circle. So, we do know the measure of this arc. You might be saying, hey wait, how do we know that measure, it's not labeled. Well, the reason why we know the measure of this arc that I've just highlighted in this teal color is because the inscribed angle that intercepts it, they gave us the information, they said this is a 45 degree angle. So, this is a 45 degree angle. Then this over here is a 90 degree, 90 degree arc. The measure of this arc is 90 degrees. The measure of arc, I guess you could say this is the measure of arc, I'ma write it this way. The measure of arc, WL. WL is equal to 90 degrees, it's twice that, the inscribed angle that intercepts it. Now, why is that helpful? Well, if you go all the way around the circle, you're 360 degrees. So, this purple arc that we cared about, that we said hey, if we could figure out the measure of that, we're gonna be able to figure out the measure of angle D. That plus arc, WL, they are going to add up to 360 degrees. Let me write that down. So, the measure of arc, let's see, and this is going to be a major arc right over here. This is so LIW, the measure of arc LIW plus the measure of arc WL plus the measure of arc WL plus this right over here. That's going to be equal to 360 degrees. This is going to be equal to 360 degrees. Now, we already know that this is 90 degrees. We already know WL is 90 degrees. So, if you subtract 90 degrees from both sides, you get that the measure of this large arc right over here, measure of arc LIW is going to be equal to 270 degrees. I just took 300, I went all the way around the circle, I subtracted out this 90 degrees and I'm left with 270 degrees. So, let me write that down. This is the measure of this arc in purple is 270 degrees. And now, we can figure out the measure of angle D. It's an inscribed angle that intercepts that arc so it's going to have half the measure, the angle's going to have half the measure. So, half of 270 is 135 degrees and we're done, and you might notice something interesting, that if you add 135 degrees plus 45 degrees, that they add up to 180 degrees. So, it looks like at least for this case that these angles, these opposite angles of this inscribed quadrilateral, it looks like they are supplementary. So, an interesting question is are they always going to be supplementary? If you have a quadrilateral, an arbitrary quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, so each of the vertices of the quadrilateral sit on the circle. If you have that, are opposite angles of that quadrilateral, are they always supplementary? Do they always add up to 180 degrees? So, I encourage you to think about that and even prove it if you get a chance, and the proof is very close to what we just did here. In order to prove it, you would just have to do it with more general numbers like, you know, instead of saying 45 degrees, you could call this X, and then you would want to prove that this right over here would have to be 180 minus X. So, I encourage you to do that on your own but I'm gonna do it in a video as well so you can check if our reasoning is similar.",math_geometry-home_cc-geometry-circles
" - So I have a function here, h of n, and let's say that it explicitly defines the terms of a sequence. Let me make a little... Let me make a quick table here. We have n, and then we have h of n. When n is equal to one, h of n is negative 31, minus seven times one minus one, which is going to be... This is just going to be zero, so it's going to be negative 31. When n is equal to two, it's going to be negative 31 minus seven times two minus one, so two minus one. This is just going to be one, so it's negative 31 minus seven, which is equal to negative 38. When n is equal to three, it's gonna be negative 31 minus seven times three minus one, which is just two, so we're gonna subtract seven twice. It's gonna be negative 31 minus 14, which is equal negative 45. What do we see happening here? We're starting at negative 31, and then we keep subtracting, we keep subtracting negative seven. We keep subtracting negative seven from that. In fact we subtract negative seven one less than the term... We subtract negative seven one less times than the term we're dealing with. If we're dealing with the third term we subtract negative seven twice. If we're dealing with the second term we subtract negative seven once. This is all nice, but what I want you to do now is pause the video and see if you can define this exact same sequence. The sequence here is you start at negative 31, and you keep subtracting negative seven, so negative 38, negative 45. The next one is gonna be negative 52, and you go on and on and on. You keep subtracting negative seven. Can we define this sequence in terms of a recursive function? Why don't you have a go at that. Let's try to define it in terms of a recursive function. Let's just call that g of n, so g of n. In some ways a recursive function is easier, because you can say okay look. The first term when n is equal to one, if n is equal to one, let me just write it, If n is equal to one, if n is equal to one, what's g of n gonna be? It's gonna be negative 31, negative 31. And if n, if n is greater than one and a whole number, so this is gonna be defined for all positive integers, and whole, and whole number, it's just going to be the previous term, so g of n minus one minus seven, minus seven. We're saying hey if we're just picking an arbitrary term we just have to look at the previous term and then subtract, and then subtract seven. It all works out nice and easy, because you keep looking at previous, previous, previous terms all the way until you get to the base case, which is when n is equal to one, and you can build up back from that. You get this exact same sequence. Let's do another example, but let's go the other way around. Here we have a, we have a sequence defined recursively, and I want to create a function that defines a sequence explicitly. Let's think about this. One way to think about it, this sequence, when n is equal to one it starts at 9.6, and then every term is the previous term minus 0.1. The second term is gonna be the previous term minus 0.1, so it's gonna be 9.5. Then you're gonna go to 9.4. Then you're gonna go to 9.3. We could keep going on and on and on. If we want, we could make a little table here, and we could say this is n, this is h of n, and you see when n is equal to one, h of n is 9.6. When n is equal to two, we're now in this case over here, it's gonna h of two minus one, so it's gonna be h of one minus 0.1. It's just gonna be this minus 0.1, which is going to be 9.5. When h is three, it's gonna be h of two, h of two minus 0.1, minus 0.1. H of two is right over here. You subtract a tenth you're gonna get 9.4, exactly what we saw over here. Let's see if we can pause the video now and define this... Create a function that constructs or defines this arithmetic sequence explicitly. Here it was recursively. We wanna define it explicitly. So let's just call it, I don't know, let's just call it f of n. We can say look, it's gonna be 9.6, but we're gonna subtract, we're gonna subtract 0.1 a certain number of times depending on what term we're talking about. We're gonna subtract 0.1, but how many times are we gonna subtract it as a function of n? Let's see. If we're talking about the first term we subtract zero times. The second term we subtract one time. The third term we subtract two times. The fourth term we subtract three times. Whatever term we're talking about we subtract that term minus one times. If we're talking about the nth term, we subtracted this value n minus one times. You can verify that this is going to work. When n is equal to one this term here is going to be zero, so this whole thing is gonna be zero. You get 9.6. When n is equal to two, two minus one, you subtract 0.1 one time. 9.6 minus 0.1 is 9.5. You could keep doing that. You could draw a table, and evaluate these if you want to. The key thing is your'e starting at 9.6 and you're subtracting 0.1 one fewer times than the term you're looking at. If you're looking at the if n is equal to, this is n is equal to four, well you're gonna subtract 0.1 three times, and you see that. Subtract 0.1 once, subtract 0.1 twice, subtract 0.1 three times.",math_engageny-alg-1_alg1-3
" -  Let's say that something is traveling at a constant rate of five meters per second. That's its velocity in one dimension. If it was negative, we'd be moving to the left. If it's positive, it's moving to the right. Let's say that we care about what is our change in distance over, the delta symbol represents change, over a change in time of four seconds. Over four seconds. I could say from t equal zero to t is equal to four. That's our change in time. That's our four-second interval that we care about. Well, one way to think about it is what a rate by definition is nothing but a change in some quantity. In this case, it's distance over a change in some other quantity. In this case, we're thinking about time. Or another way to think about it, if we multiply both sides times change in time, you get your change in distance is equal to your rate times change in time. This is very close to you, you might remember from pre-algebra, distance is equal to rate times time. Time, that just comes from the definition of what a rate is. It's a change in one quantity with respect to another quantity. If you just apply this, you can say, ""Okay, my rate is a constant five meters ""per second and my delta t is four seconds."" So times four seconds. Well, that's just going to give you 20. That's just going to get you 20. Let me do that in same color that I had for the change in distance. That's going to be 20. Then the seconds, cancel the seconds, 20 meters. So my total change in distance over those four seconds is going to be 20 meters. Nothing new here. Nothing too fancy. But I want to do now is connect this to the area under the rate function over this time period. So let's graph that. Let's graph it. That's my rate axis. This is my time axis. This is going to be in seconds. This is going to be in meters per second. Let's see, one, two, three, four, five. Let's see if it's about enough, and then I go one, two, three, four, five. Our rate, at least in this example, is a constant, is a constant five meters per second. It's a constant five meters per second. That is my r of t in this example. What did we just do here? We just multiplied our change in time times our constant rate. We just multiplied our change in time. So from time equal zero seconds to four seconds. It's this length here, if we think on that axis. Now we multiply it times our constant rate. We multiply it times this right over here. If I multiply this base times this height, what am I going to get? I'm going to get this area under the rate function. Now that area is going to be 20. If we went with the units of them, obviously you're used to things of area being something units squared because it's usually meters times meters or miles times miles or inches times inches so it'll be inches squared, meters squared, or miles squared. But here if we go at the units of the axis of the meters per second times seconds which is going to get you meters. But the important thing here is that the units here or the area here is 20. So this for that very simple example, it looks like the area under the rate curve is equal to the net change over that time period where the rate is something with respect to time. Well let's test the little burrow. It's just going to be more intuition here. Let's say that we have a different rate function. Let's say that we will make with the different, let's say instead we had a rate function. I'll use on this yellow. Let's say on a rate function, that is... Let me make it a little bit interesting. Let's say it's one meter per second, for our time is zero is less than or equal to time which is less than or equal to two seconds. Honestly, this is all in seconds where we're of time. There's two meters per second, for t is greater than two seconds. What's that going to look like? Actually, try to graph it yourself, and just say, ""Well, what is the total change in distance ""over the first, let's say five seconds?"" We want to do delta t over, not the first four seconds but the first five seconds. Well, let's graph it. Let's graph it. So this is one meter per second. One meter per second. That is two meters per second. That's in meters per second. That's my rate axis. This right over there is going to be my time axis. One, they're obviously not of the same scale, three, four, five. What is this rate function look like? Well, my rate is one meter per second between time is zero and two, including two seconds, and then the rate jumps. Nothing can accelerate instantly like this. You'd need an infinite force or an infinitely small mass I guess to, or maybe there's something that's thinking about... Anyway, I only get two complex here but this is unrealistic mode. It's not typical for something to just have spontaneous velocity increase like that but let's just go with it. Then after the two seconds, we are at a constant rate of two meters per second. Now, what is our total change in distance over the first five seconds here? So here, we care about the first five seconds, or we can break up the problem. We could say, ""Well, over the first two seconds."" Change in time is two seconds, times our constant rate over those two seconds. It's going to be two seconds times one meter per second. Well, that's going to give us two meters. So this here is going to be, shall we do that in orange color, that's going to give us two meters there, and then we look at the next section. Our change in time here is three seconds, and then we multiply that, times our constant two meters per second. That's going to give us an area of six. If we look at the units, in both cases, we're multiplying seconds times meters per second which is going to give us meters. This is going to be two plus six meters or eight meters. So hopefully this is giving you the intuition that the area under the rate curve or the rate function is going to give you our total net change in whatever that rate thing was finding the rate of. In this case, it is distance per unit time. If you take the area under the rate function, that kind of distance for the speed or this velocity function over some period of time, that area is going to be our total net change in distance.",math_calculus-1_cs1-applications-of-integrals
" So we're asked to add 3/15 plus 7/15, and then simplify the answer. So just the process when you add fractions is if they already-- well, first of all, if they're not mixed numbers, and neither of these are, and if they have the same denominator. In this example, the denominators are already the same. The denominator is 15. So if you add these two fractions, your sum is going to have the same denominator, 15, and your numerator is just going to be the sum of the numerator, so it's going to be 3 plus 7, or it's going to be equal to 10/15. Now, if we wanted to simplify this, we'd look for the greatest common factor in both the 10 and the 15, and as far as I can tell, 5 is the largest number that goes into both of them. So divide the 10 by 5 and you divide the 15 by 5, and you get-- 10 divided by 5 is 2 and 15 divided by 5 is 3. You get 2/3. Now, to understand why this works, let's draw it out. Let's split something up into 15 sections. So let me split it up into 15 sections. Let me see how well I can do this. Well, actually, even a better way, an easier way might be to draw circles. So let me do the 15 sections. So let me draw. So that is one section right over there. That is one section and then if I copy and paste it, that is a second section, and then a third section, fourth section, and then we have a fifth section. Let me copy and paste this whole thing. So that's five sections right there. Let me copy and then paste that. So that is 10 sections, and then let me do it one more time. So that is 15 sections. So you can imagine this whole thing is like a candy bar or something, and we have now split it up into 15 sections. Now, what is 3/15? Well, it's going to be 3 of the 15 sections. So 3/15 is going to be one, two, three: 3/15. Now, to that, were adding 7 of the 1/15 sections, or 7 of the sections. So we're adding 7 of those to it. So that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And you see now, if you take the orange and the blue, you get one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten of the sections, or 10 of the 15 sections. And then to see why this is the same thing as 2/3, you can just split this candy bar into thirds, so each third would have five sections in it. So let's do that. One, two, three, four, five, so that is 1/3 right there. One, two, three, four, five, that is another third right there. And notice, when you do it like this, we have filled out exactly two-- one, two-- of the thirds. This is the third third, but that's not filled in. So 10/15 is the same thing as 2/3.",math_5th-grade-foundations-engageny_5th-m3-engage-ny-foundations
" I've talked a lot about how our change in internal energy of a system can be due to some heat being added to the system, or some work being added to the system, or being done to the system. And I'm going to write it again the other way, just because you see it both ways. You could say that the change in internal energy could be the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system. So there's two questions that might naturally spring up in your head. One is, how is heat added to or taken away from a system? And how is work done, or done by, or done to a system? The heat, I think, is fairly intuitive. If I have a-- and we'll be a little bit more precise in the future of this, but I just want to give you the sense of what we're talking about-- if I have some system here, some particles in some type of a canister. And it's at temperature, I don't know, let's say it's a temperature T1. I'll even give it a-- say it's at 300 kelvin. If I want to add heat to this system, what I can do is I can place another system right next to it, maybe right next to it. Who knows what size it is. And it's got some particles there. But its temperature is much, much, much higher. So this system's temperature, I'll say temp T2 is equal to, I don't know, let's say it's 1000 kelvin. I'm just making up numbers. So what's going to happen in this situation, you're going to have heat transferred from this second system to the first system. So you're going to have heat going into the system. Now, heat and, work and even internal energy, this goes back to our conversation of macrostates versus microstates. Heat is changing the macrostate of our systems. This system is going to lose temperature. This system's going to gain temperature. But we know what's happening on a micro level. These molecules are going to lose kinetic energy. These molecules are going to gain kinetic energy. How is that actually happening? Well, we assume that there's some type of a container here. Maybe it's a solid wall. These molecules are going to bump into that wall, and are going to make the particles in that wall vibrate, and then they're going to make the particles in the green container's walls vibrate. And so when the green container's molecules touch the wall, they're going to bounce off with even more kinetic energy, with even more velocity, because of that vibration in the wall will push them back even further. So that's essentially how you get this transfer of kinetic energy, or this transfer of heat. I think that's fairly intuitive. If we put this next to a cooler, a system with lower temperature, we would lose kinetic energy, or would lose heat. And there's other ways that we can do it. We could compress the-- well, I don't want to talk about that just now, because that'll be touching on work. So, how can we add or subtract work to a system? And this one's a little bit more interesting. Let's go back to our piston example. Let me just draw some lines here. So I have my container. There you go. It's got a little movable ceiling to it. That's my piston. And go back to the example. Because what we're going to be dealing with-- especially once I go into the pressure volume diagram, the PV diagram that I'm about to go into-- we want to deal with quasi-static processes. Processes that are always close enough to equilibrium that we feel OK talking about macrostates like pressure and volume. Remember, that if we just did something crazy and the whole system is in flux, those macrostates aren't defined anymore. So we want to do a quasi-static process. So I'll have pebbles instead of one big rock. I'll draw the pebbles a little bigger this time. And I have some pressure. So that's my piston and it's being kept down by these rocks. It's being kept up by the pressure of the gas. The gas is bumping into this ceiling. It's bumping into everything. The pressure at every point in the container is the same. It's at equilibrium. Now, what happens in that example where I removed one rock from that? So let me copy and paste that. So if I remove one rock from this thing right here. Copy and paste. So that's the same thing. Now let me remove a rock. I'll remove this top one, was removed. What's going to happen? Well I now have less weight pushing down on the piston, and I have a certain amount of pressure pushing up. The system, it'll very temporarily go out of equilibrium, but it'll be a very small difference in how much we're pressing down on it, so hopefully it won't be a huge change in our equilibrium. We'll stay pretty close to it. But we know from the previous example, instead of this thing flying up, it's going to shift up a little bit. This is just going to shift up a little bit. Right when we do it it's going to be like that, right there. And let me fill in that part with black, because it's not like the space disappeared. So let me fill that in right there. So our little piston will move up a very small amount. And what I claim is, when this happened, when I removed this little pebble from here, the system did some work. And let's just think about that. So work, according to the definitions that you learned in first-year physics, and when you're using classical or dealing with classical mechanics, you learn that work is equal to force times distance. So if I'm claiming that when this piston moved up a little bit, when I removed that pebble, I'm claiming that this system here did some work. So I'm claiming that it applied a force to this piston, and it applied that force to the piston for some distance. So let's figure out what that is, and if we can somehow relate it to other macro properties that we know reasonably well. Well we know the pressure and the volume, right? We know the pressure that's being exerted on the piston, at least at this point in time. And what's pressure? Pressure is equal to force per area. Remember, this piston, you're just seeing it from the side, but it's a kind of a flat plate or a flat ceiling on top of this thing. And at what distance did it move it? You know I could blow it up a little bit. It moved it some-- I didn't draw it too big here-- some x, some distance x. So this change, it moved it up some distance x there, right? So what is the force that it pushed it up? Well, the force, we know its pressure, the pressure's force per area. So if we want to know the force, we have to multiply pressure times area. If we multiply both sides of this times area, we get force. So we're essentially saying the area of this little ceiling to this container right there, you know, it could be, I could draw with some depth, but I think you know what I'm talking about. It has some area. It's probably the same area as the base of the container. So we could say that the force being applied by our system-- let me do it in a new color-- the force is equal to our pressure of the system, times the area of the ceiling of our container of the piston. Now that's the force. Now what's the distance? The distance is this x over here. The distance is-- I'll do it in blue-- it's this change right here. I didn't draw it too big, but that's that x. Now let's see if we can relate this somehow. Let me draw it a little bit bigger. And I'll try to draw in three dimensions. So let me draw the piston. What color did I do it in? I did it in that brown color. So our piston looks something-- I'll draw it as a elipse-- the piston looks like that. And it got pushed up. So it got pushed up some distance x. Let me see how good I can-- whoops. Let me copy and paste that same-- So the piston gets pushed up some distance x. Let me draw that. It got pushed up some distance x. And we're claiming that our-- oh sorry, this is the force. Sorry, let me be clear. This is the force, and this is the distance. So work is equal to our force, which is our pressure times our area, times the distance. I want to be very clear with that. Because when I wrote this I said, OK, the force that we're applying is the pressure we're applying, times the area of our cylinder. This is the area of our cylinder right here. That's the area of our cylinder right there. So if you do the pressure times this area, you get the force. And then we moved it some distance x. Now, we could rearrange this. We could say that the work is equal to our pressure times our area, times x. What's this? What's this area, this area right here, times x? Well that's going to be our change in volume, right? 1This area times some height is some volume. 1And that's essentially how much our container 1has changed in volume. 1When we pushed this piston up, the volume of our container 1has increased. 1You can see that, even looking from the side. 1Our rectangle got a little bit taller. 1When you look at it with a little bit of depth, you see 1the rectangle also didn't get taller. 1We have some surface area. 1Surface area times height is volume. 1So this right here, this term right here, 1is a change in volume. 1So we can write work now in terms of things that we know. 1We can write work done by our system. 1Work done is equal to pressure times our change in volume. 1Now this has a very interesting repercussion here. 1So we could-- actually many-- we can rewrite our internal 1energy formulas. 1So, for example, we can write internal change and internal 1energy is now equal to heat added to the system, plus the 1work-- let me say minus the work done by the system. 1Well what is the work done by the system? 1Well it's the pressure of the system times how much the 1system expanded. 1In this case, the system is pushing these marbles, or 1these pieces of sand up. 1It's doing work. 1If we were doing it the other way, if we were adding the 1sand, and we were pushing down on our little canister, we 1would be doing work to the system. 1So this is the situation where I'm doing here, where I'm 1removing the sand and the piston goes up, essentially 1the gas is pushing up on the piston, the system 1is doing the work. 1So if we go back to our little formula, that internal energy 1is heat minus the work done by a system, so done by, then we 1can write this as, this is equal to the heat added to the 1system minus this quantity, the pressure of the system, 1times the change in volume. 1And it's interesting, if the volume is increasing, then the 1system is doing work. 1And this applies-- we're going to talk a lot more about 1engines in the future-- but that's how engines do work. 1They have a little explosion that goes on inside of a 1cylinder that pushes up on the piston, and then that piston 1moves a bunch of other stuff that eventually turns wheels. 1So the volume increases, you're actually doing work. 1So I'm going to leave you there in this video. 1In the next video, we're going to relate this, this new way 1of writing our internal energy formula, and we're going to 1relate it to the PV diagram.",science_chemistry_thermodynamics-chemistry
" -  The following tables lists the values of functions f and h, and of their derivatives, f prime and h prime for x is equal to three. So all this is telling us, with x is equal to three, the value of the function is six, f of three is six, you could view it that way. h of three is zero, f prime of three is six, and h prime of three is four. And now they want us to evaluate the derivative with respect to x of the product of f of x and h of x when x is equal to three. One way you could view this is, if we viewed some function, if we viewed some function g of x. g of x as being equal to the product of f of x and h of x, this expression is the derivative of g of x. So we could write g prime of x is equal to the derivative with respect to x of f of x times h of x. Which is what we see right here, and which is what we want to evaluate at x equals three. So we essentially want to evaluate g prime of three. This is what they're asking us to do. Well, to do that, let's go first up here. Let's just think about what this is doing. They're asking us to take the derivative with respect to x of the product of two functions that we have some information about. Well, if we're taking the derivative of the product of two functions, you could imagine that the product rule could prove useful here. So I'm just gonna restate the product rule. This is going to be equal to the derivative of the first function, f prime of x, times the second function, not taking its derivative. Plus the first function, not taking its derivative, f of x, times the derivative of the second function, h prime of x. So if you're trying to find g prime of three, well that's just going to be f prime of three times h of three plus f of three times h prime of three. And lucky for us, they give us what all these things evaluate to. f prime of three, right over here, they tell us. f prime when x is equal to three is equal to six. So this right over here is six. h of three, they give us that, too. h of three, when x is three, the value of our function is zero. So this is zero. So this first term is you just get six times zero, which is gonna be zero, but we'll get to that. Now f of three. f of three. Well, the function when x is equal to three, f of three is equal to six. So that is six. And then finally, h prime evaluated at three, h prime of x when x is equal to three, h prime of x is equal to four. Or you could say this is h prime of three. So this is four. And so there you have it. This is going to evaluate to six times zero, which, that's all just gonna be zero, plus six times four, which is going to be equal to 24. And we're done.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-derivative-rules
" -  We are told Ismael made a scaled copy of the following quadrilateral. He used a scale factor less than one, all right. And then they say what could be the length of the side that corresponds to AD? So AD is right over here. AD has length 16 units in our original quadrilateral. What could be the length of the side that corresponds with AD on the scaled copy of the quadrilateral? So it's a scale factor less than one. So we're gonna get something that is less than 16 for that side. And the rest of it will all be scaled by the same factor. So the resulting quadrilateral might look something, might look something like this. This is just my hand-drawn version. So the key realization is is if our scale factor is less than one, this thing right over here is going to be less than 16 units. So let's look at the choices. And it says choose three answers. So pause the video. Which of these would match if we're scaling by a factor of less than one? Well, we just have to see which of these are less than 16 units. This is less than 16. This is less than 16. This is less than 16. And those are the only three that are less than 16. 32 units, this would be a scale factor of two. 64 units, this would be a scale factor of four, clearly a scale factor that is not less than one.",math_7th-grade-illustrative-math_unit-1-scale-drawings
" -  So, just as a bit of review. If we take the members of a certain species that share the same area, we call that a population. Population. All of the organisms in this particular population will be members of the same species. There could be other members of that species that aren't in that same area, and they wouldn't be a member of this particular population. And a certain area won't have just one, or it doesn't tend to have just one species in it. So, we could call this population one. You might have other populations there of a different species. So, this is another species right over here. All of them combined in the same area, we could call this population, population two. And if you take... And we could, obviously have many more populations there. And if you take all of the populations in a given area, there's flexibility on how you define that area or define that region, you take those together, so you're really taking all of the living things in a certain area, we call that a community. A community of populations. Now, the community only consists of living things, the biotic factors. So, let me write that down. Biotic referring to the living things in a certain area. But if we want to think about not just the living things, but also the non-living things in that region. So, I'll write abiotic. Let me do that in another color. So, let's take the abiotic factors, or the abiotic environment. And, once again, we're sharing the same region, and that is flexible on how you define that region. You put all of these things together, and then you get your ecosystem. Your ecosystem, once again, it could be a very small region, it could be a very large region, but it's made up of all living things, the biotic factors, and the non-living things, the abiotic factors. Now, what we're gonna think about in this video is just the types of ecosystems that you might have. Think a little bit about it, and also begin to think about how the different factors interact with each other. How there's conservation of matter where, within an ecosystem, matter tends to go from one form to another. You also have a flow of energy. Energy tends to enter an ecosystem in form of light, and that energy gets transferred from one organism to another, and, sometimes, even involving the non-living things, eventually, getting turned into actual heat. Now, in terms of the types of ecosystems. I already mentioned there's a lot of variety there. This, right here, is a picture of a tide pool at Half Moon Bay, not too far from where I live. I've actually been to the tide pools at Half Moon Bay. And you could consider one particular tide pool, both the abiotic factors, the water, and the rock there, as well as the biotic factors, the starfish, the sea anemones, and whatever else might be living there. Those combined, that could be an ecosystem. You might say that the entire beach is an ecosystem. You might say that the entire region is an ecosystem. Once again, it depends on how much you want to zoom in or how much you want to zoom out, and you can zoom out a good bit. This rain forest, right over here, this is the Amazon rain forest. You can consider the whole rain forest an ecosystem, or maybe you just want to study, maybe you just want to study what's happening in this exact region, right over there. You can also consider that an ecosystem. You can consider what's happening in the river, itself, an ecosystem, or, maybe, one part of that river. And, as you notice, I'm talking about some ecosystems that are on land, and some that are in water, and that is a general way, one way of classifying them. So an ecosystem, you could have it on land. You could have it on, near, in the water. So, you could say it's aquatic. And then, if within aquatic, you could have ones that... You have salt water, or partially salty water, and these are called marine, and the main marine ecosystem, we're thinking about the oceans and things like that. And then, you have freshwater ecosystems. Like if you are in the upper-Amazon, that is freshwater that is flowing. So we could say fresh, freshwater, non-salty water. And even though it looks like rivers are big and there's a lot of freshwater around us. Obviously we need freshwater to live, most of the aquatic ecosystems are marine, are not involved freshwater. Freshwater is a very small subset. Now, this is just a few examples. Even your body, you could view your body as a whole ecosystem. You could view parts of your body as an ecosystem. You could look at just... You could look at just a fraction of... If this is my hand right over here, you could take just a little square, there, and you could consider that an ecosystem. You can think about the different bacteria that are there, other types of microorganisms that are there, and how they're interacting with the non-living things, the air. How they're interacting with the oil on your skin, with the dead skin cells, and also, how they're interacting with the living skin cells, and you, yourself. Now, since we're in the, since we're focused on how we can classify ecosystems, one thing that's often done is classifying land ecosystems into various categories. And, right over here, we have depicted the major types of land ecosystems on our planet and where you might find them. And these different types of land ecosystems, these are called biomes. Biomes. And as you can see from this diagram, tropical forests, you can find it right over here. This is the Amazon rain forest. You can find it in Africa. You can find it in Southeast Asia. You can find it in Central and even Southern or North America. You have boreal forests which you'll find in more northern latitudes. Savanna, desert, tundra, chaparral, polar ice, temperate forest, temperate grasslands, and these are just helpful for thinking about roughly the types of ecosystem, or ecosystems we would find in those regions. And it's typically most determined by temperature, moisture, the climate. Actually, the climate and the terrain and the types of minerals that you would find there, that tends to be a pretty good indicator for what it will be like, what the life would be like. But even with that said, there could still be a lot of variety. For example, the Sonoran Desert, that is right over here in the southwest United States, in the northwest Mexico. This is a desert, and there's deserts all over the rest of the planet, but they won't have... They might be similar in a lot of ways, but they won't have the exact same climate, or the exact same abiotic factors, or the exact same biotic factors. So, for example, right now I'm gonna show you a picture, pictures of the Sonoran Desert and the Rock Desert that's on the island of Boa Vista. Boa Vista is right over there. You really can't see it. It's a very small island off the coast of Africa. And, as we see in these diagrams, or in this picture, you don't have to be an expert to recognize that, okay, these are both deserts. They both look dry. There's not a lot of water here, but they are also very different. The Sonoran Desert looks to have at least a lot more life, than the Rock Desert have here. It's appropriately named the Rock Desert because it seems, at least to the naked eye, it looks like all you can see is rock. So biomes, once again, it's a very rough, high-level way to classifying land ecosystems. But even the same biome can be very, very... Two things that are categorizing in the same biome could be very different.",science_high-school-biology_hs-ecology
" -  What I'd like to do in this video is talk about the notion of a frame of reference and this is an introductory video. In future videos, we'll go into a lot more depth, but a frame of reference is really the idea it's a point of view from which you are measuring things and as we'll see, many of the quantities that we might measure in physics, like velocity or displacement, they could be different depending on our point of view, depending on which frame of reference we are measuring from and to get this an intuitive grasp of it, I'm going to draw the exact same scenario from three different frames of reference. There's the first one, this is the second one, and this is the third one. So in this first frame of reference, this first scenario, we're gonna talk about the frame of reference of the ground. So if you are a stationary observer on the ground, so you could imagine this is you here and you're the person doing the measuring of let's say we want to measure velocities. So from your point of view, since you're stationary relative to the ground, what does the ground's velocity look like? Well, you and the ground appear to be stationary, appear to not be moving. Now, what if you take out your instruments for measuring velocity or you see a change in, you see what the displacement is over a certain time for the plane and the car and you're able to see okay, look, this plane has a velocity to the right of 250 meters per second, 250 meters per second, and let's say this car that is moving quite fast by car standards is moving to the left at 50 meters per second. So this should be 1/5 of that length. So let me draw a little bit. So let's say this is moving to the left at 50 meters per second. Well, none of this seems crazy. You might be able to go outside next to the highway and see, well 50 meters per second would be quite fast, but anyway, you could observe this type of thing happening and it seems completely reasonably. But what if we were to change our frame of reference, change the point of view from which we are measuring things. So let's take the frame of reference of the car. Well in this frame of reference, let's say you're sitting in this car and I don't recommend you doing this while driving, let's say someone else is driving or it's an autonomous vehicle of some kind and you take out your physics instruments with the stopwatch and you see what the displacement is of the ground and the plane over, say, a second and you are able to first say, from your point of view, you're like well the car is stationary, the car has a velocity of zero, the car is stationary and from your point of view, you would actually measure the ground to be moving. You would see the trees move past you to the right, or behind you if you're moving to the left, and so from your point of view the ground would actually look like it's moving in this direction, in that direction, at 50 meters per second. It would look like it's moving behind you or in this case, the way we're looking at it, to the right at 50 meters per second. Now, what would the plane look like? Well, the plane not only would it look like it's moving to the right at 250 meters per second, not only would it be just that 250 meters per second, but relative to you it'd look like it's going even faster 'cause you're going past it, you are going to the left from the stationary, from the ground's point of view at 50 meters per second. So the plane, to you, is gonna look like it's going 250 plus 50 meters per second. So the vector would look like this and so it would look like it's going to the right at 300, let me write that in that orange color, at 300 meters per second. Now, what about from the point of view of the plane? What if we're talking about the plane's frame of reference? Why don't you pause this video and think about what the velocities would be of the plane, the car, and the ground from the plane's point of view. All right, now let's work through this together. So now, we're sitting in the plane and once again we shouldn't be flying the plane, we're letting someone else do that, we have our physics instruments out and we're trying to measure the velocities of these other things from my frame of reference. Well, the plane, first of all, is going to appear to be stationary and that might seem counterintuitive, but if you've ever sat in a plane, especially when there's no turbulence and the plane is already at altitude and it's not taking off or landing, oftentimes if you close your eyes you don't know if you are moving. In fact, if you close all of the windows, it feels like you are in a stationary object, that you might as well be in a house. So from the plane's point of view, you feel like, or from your point of view in the plane, it feels like the plane is stationary. Now the ground, however, looks like it's moving quite quickly. It'll look like it's moving past you at 250 meters per second. Whoops, try and draw a straight line. At 200... At 250. Sometimes my tools act funny. So, at 250 meters per second to the left. And the car, well it's moving to the left even faster. It's going to be moving to the left 50 meters per second faster than the ground is. So the car is gonna look not like it's just going 50 meters per second, it's gonna look like it's going 50 meters plus another 250 meters per second for a total of 300 meters per second to the left. So this gives you an appreciation for what frames of references are. You can view it for this introductory video as a point of view from which you're making your measurements. Now, it's tempting for a lot of folks to say well there must be one correct frame of reference and a lot of times in our everyday world you might say well this, maybe this is the correct frame of reference and these are just, we're just imagining this or this is just the mistake and the reason why we do that is because we're using the frame of reference of this big, giant thing called the earth, but it actually turns out that none of these frames of reference are more valid than the other ones, that they are all equivalent, that they are all valid frames of reference, not, I shouldn't say they're equivalent, we're obviously getting different measurements from them, but they're all, from a physics point of view, equally valid frames of reference.",science_physics_one-dimensional-motion
" -  ""Ksenia wants to chop broccoli ""and carrots for a competition. ""It takes her the same number of seconds ""to chop each carrot, and it takes her the same number ""of seconds to chop each broccoli head. ""Her goal is to chop at least 20 vegetables ""with a time limit of 540 seconds,"" all right. ""The graph below represents the set ""of all combinations of carrots and broccoli. ""Inequality A,"" let's see, ""Inequality A represents ""the range of all combinations Ksenia wants to chop."" Because she wants to chop at least 20 vegetables. So, that's what Inequality A is representing, that she wants to chop at least 20 vegetables. So, all this blue shaded area and even the line, is a solid line so it includes point on the line. These are all of the scenarios where she's chopping at least 20 vegetables, all this blue area including the blue line. And it says, ""Inequality B represents the range of all combinations she can chop with her time limit."" So, Inequality B, this is all of the combinations where she is within her time limit, where she is not spending any more than 540 seconds. ""What is the least number of carrots Ksenia can chop while achieving her goal?"" Well, her goal, remember she wants to chop at least 20 vegetables. So, you want to be in the blue area. You want to be in the solution set for Inequality A, which would be the blue area or on the blue line. And she wants to achieve her goal of meeting the time limit. So, she needs to also be in the solution set for Inequality B so she also has to be in the green area or on the green line. And so the overlap of the two, if she's meeting both constraints, it's going to be all of this area. This is the overlap of the two solution sets. So, in this overlap where is the least number of carrots. ""What is the least number of carrots Ksenia can chop while achieving her goal."" So, if we see here, the least number of carrots, you might tempted to say, ""Okay, 20 carrots, that is in the solution set."" That would be 20 carrots and zero broccoli heads but you can actually find a combination that has even fewer carrots. You can go all the way to this point because remember the points on the lines are also included in the solution sets, because they are solid lines not dash lines. So, this point right over here, 10 carrots and 10 broccoli heads actually meets her goal. So, let me write that down. 10 carrots and 10 broccoli, 10 broccoli heads. Let me just write that, 10 broccoli heads. So, that's the least amount. If you wanted to somehow figure out less than 10 carrots, in any of those scenarios there's no overlap. You know, if you say, ""Oh, is there any way ""to do nine carrots?"" If you look over here there's no overlap at c equals nine between the two solution sets. So, the minimum right over here is actually the point of intersection of these two lines. 10 carrots, 10 broccoli heads that's the combination that has her chopping the minimum number of carrots while achieving, frankly, her goals, both of her goals. Being under time and chopping at least 20 vegetables.",math_algebra_inequalities-systems-graphs
" -  Okay, so this is our microcontroller board, and let me move the plug here, let's see if I can take some of these plugs out, so the power comes into this board through these two plugs here, and flows to this socket here and this socket here. And there are a number of different components and chips on this board, we're gonna talk about each of them and sort of what they do. Now, in full disclosure there's certain components I'm not 100% sure what this chip does, but I think I know, so we'll go through that and we'll make the best guess that we can. So this I believe is an EEPROM, which is an erasable memory chip an electrically erasable, programmable memory chip that stores an index of commands for this board even when the power's shut off. So this chip right here, which is the Central Processing Unit chip, and controls all the functions of this board as well as the functions of the entire unit, this chip basically can go and pull indexed commands from this as, you know, it sort of acts as its memory. And then this is the clock chip. So this one has a little quartz crystal in it, and quartz has an interesting property. When it is squeezed, it can emit a small electrical signal or when electricity is run to it, it will expand just slightly. And so because of that, it's very consistent in the way that it responds to electricity and very consistent in the way that it expands and so because of that property, they're able to run electricity to it and get it to expand and get a return voltage and then they can determine this device here can allow the chips to determine a very precise timing. It's the same type of timer that's inside of a quartz wrist watch. But anyway, it allows this board to synchronize itself which is really important when you're reading a lot of data from a disk and you have to make sure all those ones and zeroes end up in the right place and everything happens in sync. So that's very important there. As I said before this is the central processing chip that controls the board and the functions on the board, I believe this chip is the video and audio processing chip so once the data comes in, it's routed through the CPU, to this, and processed and converted into a signal that your TV and stereo will understand. I believe this chip is an Op Amp chip, which basically stands for Operational Amplifier and it will boost the signal coming out of this chip. So this chip's signal may be very weak, and in order to get it to travel down the cords to go to your TV and your stereo, you need to boost the signal, increase the voltage, and that's what this guy can do. And this chip right here is a motor controller. And so what it does is it controls the direction and speed of the motors, and it does that in a very precise way, so it works with the CPU to make sure that the motors are moving in the right direction and at the right speed.",science_electrical-engineering_reverse-engin
" Let's see if we can take the integral of cosine of 5x over e to the sine of 5x dx. And there's a crow squawking outside of my window, so I'll try to stay focused. So let's think about whether u-substitution might be appropriate. Your first temptation might have said, hey, maybe we let u equal sine of 5x. And if u is equal to sine of 5x, we have something that's pretty close to du up here. Let's verify that. So du could be equal to-- so du dx, derivative of u with respect to x. Well, we just use the chain rule. Derivative of 5x is 5. Times the derivative of sine of 5x with respect to 5x, that's just going to be cosine of 5x. If we want to write this into differential form, which is useful when we do our u-substitution, we could say that du is equal to 5 cosine 5x. And we look over here, we don't have quite du there. We have just cosine of 5x dx. Cosine of 5x dx just like that. So when you look over here, you have a cosine of 5x dx, but we don't have a 5 cosine of 5x dx. But we know how to solve that. We can multiply by 5 and divide by 5. 1/5 times 5 is just going to be 1, so we haven't changed the value of the expression. When we do it this way, we see pretty clearly we have our u and we have our du. Our du is 5. Let me circle that. Let me do that in that blue color-- is 5 cosine of 5x dx. So we can rewrite this entire expression as-- do that 1/5 in purple. This is going to be equal to 1/5-- I hope you don't hear that crow outside. He's getting quite obnoxious. 1/5 times the integral of all the stuff in blue is my du, and then that is over e to the u. So how do we take the antiderivative of this? Well, you might be tempted to well, what would you do here? Well, we're still not quite ready to simply take the antiderivative here. If I were to rewrite this, I could rewrite this as this is equal to 1/5 times the integral of e to the negative u du. And so what might jump out at you is maybe we do another substitution. We've already used the letter u, so maybe we'll use w. We'll do some w-substitution. And you might be able to do this in your head, but we'll do w-substitution just to make it a little bit clearer. This would have been really useful if this was just e to the u because we know the antiderivative of e to the u is just e to the u. So let's try to get it in terms of the form of e to the something and not e to the negative something. So let's set. And I'm running out of colors here. Let's set w as equal to negative u. In that case, then dw, derivative of w with respect to u, is negative 1. Or if we were to write that statement in differential form, dw is equal to du times negative 1 is negative du. So this right over here would be our w. And do we have a dw here? Well, we have just a du. We don't have a negative du there. But we can create a negative du by multiplying this inside by a negative 1, but then also by multiplying the outside by a negative 1. Negative 1 times negative 1 is positive 1. We haven't changed the value. We have to do both of these in order for it to make sense. Or I could do it like this. So negative 1 over here and a negative 1 right over there. And if we do it in that form, then this negative 1 times du, that's the same thing as negative du. This is this right over here. And so we can rewrite our integral. It's going to be equal to now it's going to be negative 1/5. Trying to use the colors as best as I can. Negative 1/5 times the indefinite integral of e to the-- well, instead of negative u, we can write w-- e to the w. And instead of du times negative 1, or negative du, we can write dw. Now this simplifies things a good bit. We know what the antiderivative of this is in terms of w. This is going to be equal to negative 1/5 e to the w. And then we might have some constant there, so I'll just do a plus c. And now we just have to do all of our unsubstituting. So we know that w is equal to negative u. So we could write that. So this is equal to negative 1/5. I want to stay true to my colors. Negative 1/5 e to the negative u, that's what w is equal to, plus c. But we're still not done unsubstituting. We know that u is equal to sine of 5x. u is equal to sine of 5x, so we can write this as being equal to negative 1/5 times e to the negative u, which is negative u is sine of 5x. And then finally, we have our plus c. Now, there was a simpler way that we could have done this by just doing one substitution. But then you would have had to look ahead a little bit and realize that it was not trivial to take your-- not too bad to take your antiderivative of e to the negative u. The insight that you might have had-- although you shouldn't really hold yourself, feel too bad if you didn't see that insight-- is that we could have rewritten that original integral-- and let me rewrite it. It's cosine of 5x over e to the sine of 5x dx. We could have written this entire original integral as being equal to cosine of 5x times e to the negative sine of 5x dx. And in this situation, we could have set u to be equal to negative 5x and say, well, if u is equal to negative sine of 5x. If u is equal to negative sine of 5x, then du is going to be equal to negative 5 cosine of 5x. And we don't have a negative-- oh, dx. We don't have a negative 5 here, but we could construct one by putting a negative 5 there and then multiplying by negative 1/5. And then that would have immediately simplified this integral right over here to be equal to negative 1/5 times the integral of well, we have our du. Let me do this in a different color. We have our du. That's the negative 5. Let me do it this way. Negative 5 cosine of 5x dx. So that is our du. I'm just changing the order of multiplication. Times e to the u. This whole thing now is u this second time around. So if we did it this way, with just one substitution, we could have immediately gotten to the result that we wanted. You take the antiderivative of this. I'll do it in one color now just because I think you get the idea. This is equal to negative 1/5 e to the u plus c. u is equal to negative sine of 5x. So this is equal to negative 1/5 e to the negative sine of 5x plus c And you're done. So this one is faster. It's simpler. And over time, you might even start being able to do this in your head. This top one, you still didn't mess up by just setting u equal to sine of 5x, we just have to do an extra substitution in order to work it through all the way. And I was able to do this video despite the crowing crow outside, or squawking crow.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-integrals
" If you've ever used a map on your cell phone to get you from place A to place B, you're familiar with the idea that a map is simply a representation of some sort of area that actually exists in the real world. So a map on your cell phone is a digital map of an actual place somewhere in the world. Similar to this digital road map, your brain also has a map of your body. And this map is something known as the somatosensory homunculus. The somatosensory homunculus is basically a map of your body in your brain. And let me go into this because it is a little bit confusing conceptually at first. So what I've drawn over here is a picture of the brain. Let's just focus in on this pink area over here. This pink area is something known as the cortex. And this region that I shaded in in orange over here is a specialized part of your brain that receives sensory input from your entire body. So whenever you feel pain or whenever you feel some sort of heat anywhere in your body, all this information is actually sent through the spinal cord into the brain. And it all ends up over here in this one part of the cortex. And this part of the cortex is known as the sensory strip. So let me just clean this up a little bit. So if we were to actually take a cross-sectional look at the sensory strip, so if we cut the brain just right down the middle and kind of looked at it this way, what we would see would be this large orange structure that I drew here. So this orange structure is basically just the sensory strip. And we're looking at it this way if we cut it right down the middle. And so as I mentioned before, this sensory strip contains a somatosensory homunculus. And the somatosensory homunculus is basically a map of the body in the brain. And what I mean by this is that information that comes from your hand to the brain will all end up in one part of the sensory strip. So information from your finger will actually come over here. Information from these fingers will come over here. Information from the palm of your hand will come over here. Information from your wrist will actually end up over here in the sensory strip. And similarly, if we were getting information from your foot, the information from your foot would all synapse over here in this part of the cortex. And information from your toes would synapse over here. So you get the idea. Basically, information from various parts of the body will come into the brain, hit the sensory strip, and it will always go to one part of that sensory strip. So this is your face over here. So this would be the face. And so information from the lips would come right here, information from the eyes would go over here, and so on. So basically, the sensory strip always receives information from different parts of the body. And that information will always go to one part of the sensory strip. So let me again clean this up a little. If this is still a little confusing, let me try explaining it a different way. So let's imagine that there was a brain tumor right over here. This brain tumor would kind of look like this. It would basically be in this region of the brain. And so in order to figure out what part of the brain is tumor and what part of the brain is normal, neurosurgeons can actually go in with an electrode and touch different parts of the cortex. So they can actually come in, and touch this part of the cortex, and touch this part of the cortex. And this electrode will actually cause the cells that it touches to stimulate. And so in some cases, the surgery can actually be conducted on patients that are awake. And so if a surgeon touches this part of the cortex, patients can actually say, oh, I feel as if somebody is touching my wrist. And if the surgeon touches this part of the cortex, people might say, oh, I feel somebody touching my forehead or my eye. So depending on what part of the cortex the surgeon places his electrode, the patient will get a sensation of some part of his or her body being touched. The reason that surgeons do this is to make sure that they aren't removing parts of the cortex that are involved in sensation, because if the surgeon were to remove this part of the cortex, the patient would no longer have any feeling in the wrist or in the forearm. So they need to make sure that the part of the cortex that they're removing is not involved in sensation. Otherwise, the patient would actually lose sensation. Similarly, if the surgeon removed this part of the cortex, the patient would lose sensation in the lips because that is part of the cortex actually receives input from the lips. So let me again clean this up just to go over everything one last time. So the sensory homunculus basically maps out the body in the brain. So as information comes to the brain from different parts of the body, information from the hand will all synapse in this region of the cortex. Information from the face will synapse in this region. Information from the feet will synapse in this region. And so what this effectively creates is a topological map of the entire body in this strip of cortex. And this topological representation of the body in the cortex is what's known as the somatosensory homunculus.",science_health-and-medicine_nervous-system-and-sensory-infor
" -  In the last video, I started introducing the intuition for the Laplacian operator in the context of the function with this graph and with the gradient field pictured below it. And here, I'd like to go through the computation involved in that. So the function that I had there was defined, it's a two-variable function. And it's defined as f(x,y) is equal to three plus cos(x/2) multiplied by sin(y/2). And then the Laplacian which we define with this right side up triangle is an operator of f. And it's defined to be the divergence, so kind of this nabla dot times the gradient which is just nabla of f. So two different things going on. It's kind of like a second derivative. And the first thing we need to do is take the gradient of f. And the way we do that, we kind of imagine expanding this upside down triangle as a vector full of partial differential operators: partial partial x and partial partial y. And with a gradient, you just kind of imagine multiplying that by the function. So if you imagine multiplying that by the function, what it looks like is just a vector full of partial derivatives. So you're taking the partial of f with respect to x and the partial of f with respect to y. Those are the two different components of this vector-valued function that is the gradient. And in our specific example, when we take the partial derivative of f with respect to x what we get, is we look over here. Three just looks like a constant, so nothing happens. Cos(x) halves. The derivative of that with respect to x, we kind of take out that 1/2. So 1/2, and the derivative of cos is -sin. So that's -sin(x/2). And sin(y/2), well, y just looks like a constant. So sin(y/2) is just some other constant. So in our derivative, we just keep that constant in there, that sin(y/2). And then, for the second component, the partial derivative of f with respect to y. Three still looks like a constant cause it is a constant. Now, cos(x/2) looks like a constant because as far as y is concerned, x is a constant. So cos(x) is a constant. But then, the sin(y) has a derivative of cos. And we also take out that 1/2. So you take out that 1/2 when you take the derivative of the inside and then the derivative of the outside is cosine of whatever was in there. So in this case, y/2. And we're multiplying it by that original constant, cos(x/2). So, still we have our cos(x/2) since it was a constant times a certain variable thing, x/2. So that's the gradient. And then, the next step here is to take the divergence of that. So with the divergence, we're going to imagine taking that del operator and dot producting with this guy. So if I scroll down to give some room here, we're going to take that, that vector that's kind of the same vector, the partial partial x. And I say vector, but vector-ish thing, partial partial y. And now we're going to take the dot product with this entire guy. So I'll go ahead and just copy it over. Just kind of copy it over here. And let's see. So, I need a little bit more room to evaluate this. So here, when you imagine taking the dot product, you kind of multiply these top components together. So we're taking the partial derivative with respect to x of this whole guy. And when you do that, well you get, you still have that 1/2 and then the derivative of -sin(x/2). So that 1/2 gets pulled out when you're kind of taking the derivative of the inside. And the derivative of -sin is -cos. So -cos of that stuff on the inside, that x/2. And of course, we still multiply it by this. This looks like a constant, the sin(y/2). And we multiply by that, sin(y/2). And then we add that because it's kind of like a dot product. You add that to what it looks like when you multiply these next two components. So we're going to add. And you have that 1/2. And then cos(y/2), when we differentiate that you also pull out the 1/2. So again, you have that pulled-out 1/2. And the derivative of cos is -sin. So now we're taking -sin of, and then that stuff on the inside, y/2. And we continue multiplying by the constant. As far as y is concerned, cos(x/2) is a constant. So we multiply it by that, cos(x/2). And then that, so that is the divergence of that gradient field. So the divergence of the gradient of our original function gives us the Laplacian. And in fact, we could simplify this further because both of these terms kind of look identical. But the main point of this video is kind of how you go through that process where you imagine taking the gradient of your function and then the divergence of that. And that's what the Laplacian is. See you next video.",math_multivariable-calculus_multivariable-derivatives
" - [Karl Voiceover] Okay, so here's our Vivitar ViviCam Camera, and we're gonna take it apart and show you how it works. We got the batteries here, and there's the on switch, and now that we have the camera on we're going to take a few photos. You can see the LCD display is showing what's going on there, and letting us see the pictures. Now the LCD is backlit with an LED, which is, LCD stands for liquid crystal display, and LED stands for light emitting diode. So, let's go ahead and get crackin', we'll take it apart. We'll take all the screws out that are holding the two halves of the camera together. So we'll remove the top part, and that's likely made out of ABS, and there's a electroplated bezel, that surrounds the lens of the camera, it's screwed in place. And that's also probably ABS, plated ABS. And now let's go and take a look at what the camera's latch looks like and what it's made out of. We've got some, looks like chrome-plated stamped steel, connected to a spring, and that feeds the electricity from the underside of the back side of the batteries, to the board, and so that's where the positive connection on the board is, and the negative connection is up at the top. So we're gonna remove the pin and we can take the latch out now. Now you can slide the latch back and forth, you can see how it moves. Again this is plated steel, you can see there's four little connections on there, we'll talk about those in a second, but let's remove this back piece. This is just a simple insert, and I think it's probably heat staked in place. What that means is really low-cost way to attach things. This metal piece is as well, you can see those four points there. They're heat staked in and it is magnetic, so it's plated steel. And so, now we're gonna remove these screws that are connecting the plastic bezel that surrounds the camera and connects the two sides. And so you can see, it's just an injection molded piece, and I believe that that material is ABS, but again it didn't have a plastic designation on it, so it's not 100%, could be polypropylene or maybe styrene. Probably styrene. So there's the on button and the off button, I should say, the on button and the shutter button, and they push down and trigger the membrane switches, which are mounted on our printed circuit board, or a piece of the printed circuit board that's connected. So now let's take out the screws that are holding the board in place. And we tried to remove the screws for our tripod mount, but one of them is stripped, so we're just going to leave it in place. And I think we'll just pop the back out there and we'll take a look at the two switch covers. These switches are injection molded and then they are painted, and then heat staked in place. And so you can see the silver colors from the paint, and the heat stake process is basically the plastic, just a little tab at the end of the plastic is melted against the outer part of the housing. And again, it's just a really low-cost way to hold the switches in place, and keep them above their membrane switches. So you can see which ones go with which, these are the, that's the on/off switch, and this is the selector button. These selector buttons allow you to scroll through pictures, and then we have a menu and a play button. So this is our step by step of what happens when you take a photo. The first thing that happens is the lens right here collects some light. So let's take a look at how that happens. So the light's going to come down from the sun, hit Billy, reflect off of him, go in through the lens, get focused on our image sensor, and when it does that, it's going to pass through these two filters. And at this point, photons are what's conveying the information. So it's just a reflected light that's conveying the information to our image sensors. So it's going through the lens, and our filters. And so we have an infrared filter here, and the infrared filter is, basically helps to, it keeps the infrared out, and that can effect the image. We also have a bare color filter. The bare color filter is right on top of the image sensor, and it basically breaks the sensor up into what looks like a checkerboard of red, green, and blue, and there's twice as many green as there is red and blue, because our eyes are more sensitive to some colors than to others. And so, the bare filter allows us to get color information from our image sensor. So there's two types of image sensors; there's the CCD, or charge coupled device, and a CMOS, a complimentary metal oxide semiconductor. Now the CCD tends to have less noise than the CMOS, and it tends to be a little bit more expensive, and the components for doing the analogue processing are not mounted on the board, they're usually not on the board, they're off of the board. Now the CMOS has the components that some of the transistors for doing the analogue processing on the board, and so the CMOS tends to be a lot less expensive, it also tends to take a lot less power, and it tends to have more noise, so the image quality tends to be less. But again, there are exceptions, if you get a really expensive CMOS chip or really inexpensive CCD, this information may not apply, these are just sort of general guidelines. So the light hits the image sensor, and it is converted into analog electrical signals, those electrical signals are sent to a digital to analogue converter, and then the digital signals, you can see those represented by the ones and zeroes, are sent to the digital image processor. So the digital image processor on this particular camera is underneath the screen. It's represented, well, it's underneath the black blob, too, the black blob is actually epoxy and it's put on the board as kind of a low-cost way to protect the processor. And so, anyway, the processors involved in the mosaicing, which means that it takes the information from that was created by the color filter, and the individual pixels, and it averages those to create a smoother image, and it uses a software algorithm to do that. And you can see that there's a little hair that's represented there in the super zoomed-in view of Billy. Okay, and it can also be used for JPEG conversion and other things. So the memory buffer on our camera is on the other side here, you can see it, it's right there, it's the big chip. And the memory buffer takes the images and stores them before they're sent to the memory card controller, or the octal latch here, and that basically acts as like the traffic control for the data going to the flash memory. And so, the flash memory is this chip right here, and the flash memory is where all the data is stored on this particular camera. Now most cameras have detachable flash memory, this one, it's built in. And that's probably because it was cheaper than buying a connector. So the LCD display you can see is right there, and that's what displays the image. And then there's our USB connector. And of course you can hook a wire and connect that to the computer and then print out the images as well, that's another way of getting your final image. Go look at some other components; this is the speaker. It's a piezo speaker, and it produces a high frequency sound when you push the buttons. And that just gives you some auditory feedback to let you know that the button has been successfully depressed. And the board itself is made out of a cloth laminate material. And so if you look at the other components on the board, let's see, there's an LED here, and another one here, and those LEDS indicate both when the camera is on, and also when a photo has been taken. So let's take a look on this side of the board, there's a little silver device, and that's a quartz timer. And the timer helps to synchronize all the functions on the board. It's used by the microprocessor to do that. You can see the resistors and capacitors here, the resistors are usually denoted by the R and the capacitors by the C. And they can be used together to both filter noise, have an influence on some of the timing functions, they can also be used to protect various circuits on the board, and various components. So these components here are power components, and they take the power from the battery and make it more usable for the camera. And you can see the traces here, the whole top of the board is covered in copper, and then the copper is etched away in the places that you don't need wire connections. So the wire connections are made with copper that's left, and you can have connections between all the different components there on the board. So we're gonna open up our screen and see what's on the inside. So on the inside of the screen, there is a LED and a die resistor, and the resistor protects the LED, and you've got a clear piece of plastic and then a white reflector in the back, and then there's a white diffuser, it's a thin piece of plastic right here. And these pieces, and then there's also a reflective part to the screen. And these pieces are all designed to sort of bounce the light around and help to diffuse evenly since there's only point of light created by that LED. You want to make sure that the image is evenly lit on the back. And the LCD display is in the top and it's sandwiched between two pieces of glass, and those pieces of glass have the liquid crystals inside, and you can sort of see that by the smoky color there, you can see through it just a little bit. And they light up, or I should say, they turn different colors and are lighted by the LED behind them, to display the image when you take a picture, or when you go through your images.

" Let's do a few examples multiplying fractions. So let's multiply negative 7 times 3/49. So you might say, I don't see a fraction here. This looks like an integer. But you just to remind yourself that the negative 7 can be rewritten as negative 7/1 times 3/49. Now we can multiply the numerators. So the numerator is going to be negative 7 times 3. And the denominator is going to be 1 times 49. 1 times 49. And this is going to be equal to-- 7 times 3 is 21. And one of their signs is negative, so a negative times a positive is going to be a negative. So this is going to be negative 21. You could view this as negative 7 plus negative 7 plus negative 7. And that's going to be over 49. And this is the correct value, but we can simplify it more because 21 and 49 both share 7 as a factor. That's their greatest common factor. So let's divide both the numerator and the denominator by 7. Divide the numerator and the denominator by 7. And so this gets us negative 3 in the numerator. And in the denominator, we have 7. So we could view it as negative 3 over 7. Or, you could even do it as negative 3/7. Let's do another one. Let's take 5/9 times-- I'll switch colors more in this one. That one's a little monotonous going all red there. 5/9 times 3/15. So this is going to be equal to-- we multiply the numerators. So it's going to be 5 times 3. 5 times 3 in the numerator. And the denominator is going to be 9 times 15. 9 times 15. We could multiply them out, but just leaving it like this you see that there is already common factors in the numerator and the denominator. Both the numerator and the denominator, they're both divisible by 5 and they're both divisible by 3, which essentially tells us that they're divisible by 15. So we can divide the numerator and denominator by 15. So divide the numerator by 15, which is just like dividing by 5 and then dividing by 3. So we'll just divide by 15. Divide by 15. And this is going to be equal to-- well, 5 times 3 is 15. Divided by 15 you get 1 in the numerator. And in the denominator, 9 times 15 divided by 15. Well, that's just going to be 9. So it's equal to 1/9. Let's do another one. What would negative 5/9 times negative 3/15 be? Well, we've already figured out what positive 5/9 times positive 3/15 would be. So now we just have to care about the sign. If we were just multiplying the two positives, it would be 1/9. But now we have to think about the fact that we're multiplying by a negative times a negative. Now, we remember when you multiply a negative times a negative, it's a positive. The only way that you get a negative is if one of those two numbers that you're taking the product of is negative, not two. If both are positive, it's positive. If both are negative, it's positive. Let's do one more example. Let's take 5-- I'm using the number 5 a lot. So let's do 3/2, just to show that this would work with improper fractions. 3/2 times negative 7/10. I'm arbitrarily picking colors. And so our numerator is going to be 3 times negative 7. 3 times negative 7. And our denominator is going to be 2 times 10. 2 times 10. So this is going to be the numerator. Positive times a negative is a negative. 3 times negative 7 is negative 21. Negative 21. And the denominator, 2 times 10. Well, that is just 20. So this is negative 21/20. And you really can't simplify this any further.",math_7th-grade-illustrative-math_unit-5-rational-number-arithmetic
" OK. So let's go ahead and put our single pole double throw lever switches on our bot. Now, we want to make sure that we attach these at the ends and that we put them so that they sort of stick off the edge. And they're at about a 45 degree angle. Like that. We're going to take a little bit of hot glue, put a little blob on that corner and a little blob on that corner. And then, we'll take our switch, and we'll set it there. We kind of want to make sure that the hot glue does not interfere with the lever. There we go. Like that. So now what we're going to do is we're going to put some batteries in. And this is basically just to provide some weight to help hold the battery holder and switches in place. Now, when you do that, be careful. Because you don't want these two wires to touch. If the two wires touch, they'll short out the batteries and melt the housing and cause problems for you. So you don't want that to happen. So what we do want to do now is we're going to take another wire-- this is a solid-core 22 gauge wire-- and we're going to strip off a good bit from the end. Let's take off about three quarters of an inch. And we'll just take that and run it through wire strippers there. And pull that off. And then, what we're going to do with that wire is we're going to hook it through the two holes. You can see there's holes in these connections here. We're going to hook it through those two holes. And then, we're going to connect this wire to it. So that's going to allow us to connect two sides of our single pole double throw switches and give us an extra wire that we can use for lighting up our LED eyes in a little bit. So we'll take our needle-nose, and we're going to try and bend the wire so we can loop it through. Let's see if we can make this work. It's kind of tricky to do. But if you can get it, you want to run the wire through the hole in the leg of the switch because it's going to give you a better connection when you solder it. There we go. It just takes a little bit of time working on it to get it in. You can see I think I popped this-- I did. I popped this switch loose. So what I might do is actually just peel this hot glue back up. That's OK. You want to make sure you get all that hot glue out if that happens to you. Just peel it up out of the way. And this is actually a good thing because it may mean that we can connect these switches a little bit more easily. But I'm going to put some more hot glue down and then put the switch back in place. There we go. Again, make sure you keep your fingers out of the way of that hot glue because it will stick to them. And it's definitely not fun to get it on your hand. And there we go. So now we have the switch in and the wires connected. Like that. OK. And let's see if we can-- I want to maneuver a little bit more and see if we can get a little bit more of this wire through. Yeah. OK. So now we can take our red-stranded wire. And we have a little piece of the solid-core that we can tie onto and solder everything together. So we're going to cut this wire down. And then, we'll take our strippers and strip off a little bit of the excess. There we go. And then, we can take this red wire and bring it up. And we just want to twist it around that solid-core wire. OK. Like that. So now, we've got a good connection, and we can solder that in place. So let's go ahead and do that. So we're going to take our soldering iron. Make sure we tin the tip, remember. A little bit of tin there. And knock off the excess. And then, I'm going to put the soldering iron right there and try and make sure I can get enough heat to the wire to get the solder to hold onto it. There we go. It's good there. And there's just one little place here where I need to make sure I've got a pretty good connection. Here we go. Now, we need to connect the next wire, which is going to be our white wire. All right. So in order to do that, we're going to take a white wire here. And I'm just going to take a little bit of the end of that off. And I think what we're going to do-- take off about this much of the insulation. And so we're going to run this wire through here. Like that. We don't need the insulation in the middle. As long as we keep the white wire away from the black wire, we should be fine. I'm sorry. As long as we keep the white wire away from the red wire. OK. There we go. So this now gives me-- so we want to make sure we keep that wire away. Like that. Now it gives me a place to connect to for the black wire. So this is the other side of our circuit, and we're going to connect to that. We'll cut it right here. And then, we'll strip off the excess insulation again. And now we're going to connect our black wire. So now we should be able to take our solder and solder all the parts together. So we're going to solder the wire and the switch right here. And then, we're going to solder the black wire and the white wire together right here. And then, we need to solder the white wire to the other side, the other switch. And so now we have our connections. Now, we don't need a whole lot of extra wire there. So we can trim off the excess. And it's OK to sort of push it out of the way. Definitely don't want your black wire that's connected to the white one here to touch the red one. So keep those things apart. 1I think I'm going to put a little bit 1more solder on that joint there. 1There we go. 1That way it all sort of flows together. 1And again, we want to make sure that those switches still work.",science_electrical-engineering_robots
" Let's say I have something moving with a constant velocity of five meters per second. And we're just assuming it's moving to the right, just to give us a direction, because this is a vector quantity, so it's moving in that direction right over there. And let me plot its velocity against time. So this is my velocity. So I'm actually going to only plot the magnitude of the velocity, and you can specify that like this. So this is the magnitude of the velocity. And then on this axis I'm going to plot time. So we have a constant velocity of five meters per second. So its magnitude is five meters per second. And it's constant. It's not changing. As the seconds tick away the velocity does not change. So it's just moving five meters per second. Now, my question to you is how far does this thing travel after five seconds? So after five seconds-- so this is one second, two second, three seconds, four seconds, five seconds, right over here. So how far did this thing travel after five seconds? Well, we could think about it two ways. One, we know that velocity is equal to displacement over change in time. And displacement is just change in position over change in time. Or another way to think about it-- If you multiply both sides by change in time-- you get velocity times change in time, is equal to displacement. So what was of the displacement over here? Well, I know what the velocity is-- it's five meters per second. That's the velocity, let me color-code this. That is the velocity. And we know what the change in time is, it is five seconds. And so you get the seconds cancel out the seconds, you get five times five-- 25 meters-- is equal to 25 meters. And that's pretty straightforward. But the slightly more interesting thing is that's exactly the area under this rectangle right over here. What I'm going to show you in this video, that is in general, if you plot velocity, the magnitude of velocity. So you could say speed to versus time. Or let me just stay with the magnitude of the velocity versus time. The area under that curve is going to be the distance traveled, because, or the displacement. Because displacement is just the velocity times the change in time. So if you just take out a rectangle right over there. So let me draw a slightly different one where the velocity is changing. So let me draw a situation where you have a constant acceleration . The acceleration over here is going to be one meter per second, per second. So one meter per second, squared. And let me draw the same type of graph, although this is going to look a little different now. So this is my velocity axis. I'll give myself a little bit more space. So this is my velocity axis. I'm just going to draw the magnitude of the velocity, and this right over here is my time axis. So this is time. And let me mark some stuff off here. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. And the magnitude of velocity is going to be measured in meters per second. And the time is going to be measured in seconds. So my initial velocity, or I could say the magnitude of my initial velocity-- so just my initial speed, you could say, this is just a fancy way of saying my initial speed is zero. So my initial speed is zero. So after one second what's going to happen? After one second I'm going one meter per second faster. So now I'm going one meter per second. After two seconds, whats happened? Well now I'm going another meter per second faster than that. After another second-- if I go forward in time, if change in time is one second, then I'm going a second faster than that. And if you remember the idea of the slope from your algebra one class, that's exactly what the acceleration is in this diagram right over here. The acceleration, we know that acceleration is equal to change in velocity over change in time. Over here change in time is along the x-axis. So this right over here is a change in time. And this right over here is a change in velocity. When we plot velocity or the magnitude of velocity relative to time, the slope of that line is the acceleration. And since we're assuming the acceleration is constant, we have a constant slope. So we have just a line here. We don't have a curve. Now what I want to do is think about a situation. Let's say that we accelerate it one meter per second squared. And we do it for-- so the change in time is going to be five seconds. And my question to you is how far have we traveled? Which is a slightly more interesting question than what we've been asking so far. So we start off with an initial velocity of zero. And then for five seconds we accelerate it one meter per second squared. So one, two, three, four, five. So this is where we go. This is where we are. So after five seconds, we know our velocity. Our velocity is now five meters per second. But how far have we traveled? So we could think about it a little bit visually. We could say, look, we could try to draw rectangles over here. Maybe right over here, we have the velocity of one meter per second. So if I say one meter per second times the second, that'll give me a little bit of distance. And then the next one I have a little bit more of distance, calculated the same way. I could keep drawing these rectangles here, but then you're like, wait, those rectangles are missing, because I wasn't for the whole second, I wasn't only going one meter per second. I kept accelerating. So I actually, I should maybe split up the rectangles. I could split up the rectangles even more. So maybe I go every half second. So on this half-second I was going at this velocity. And I go that velocity for a half-second. Velocity times the time would give me the displacement. And I do it for the next half second. Same exact idea here. Gives me the displacement. So on and so forth. But I think what you see as you're getting-- is the more accurate-- the smaller the rectangles, you try to make here, the closer you're going to get to the area under this curve. And just like the situation here. This area under the curve is going to be the distance traveled. And lucky for us, this is just going to be a triangle, and we know how to figure out the area for triangle. So the area of a triangle is equal to one half times base times height. Which hopefully makes sense to you, because if you just multiply base times height, you get the area for the entire rectangle, and the triangle is exactly half of that. So the distance traveled in this situation, or I should say the displacement, just because we want to make sure we're focused on vectors. The displacement here is going to be-- or I should say the magnitude of the displacement, maybe, which is the same thing as the distance, is going to be one half times the base, which is five seconds, times the height, which is five meters per second. Times five meters. Let me do that in another color. Five meters per second. The seconds cancel out with the seconds. And we're left with one half times five times five meters. So it's one half times 25, which is equal to 12.5 meters. And so there's an interesting thing here, well one, there's a couple of interesting things. Hopefully you'll realize that if you're plotting velocity versus time, the area under the curve, given a certain amount of time, tells you how far you have traveled. The other interesting thing is that the slope of the curve tells you your acceleration. What's the slope over here? Well, It's completely flat. And that's because the velocity isn't changing. So in this situation, we have a constant acceleration. The magnitude of that acceleration is exactly zero. Our velocity is not changing. Here we have an acceleration of one meter per second squared, and that's why the slope of this line right over here is one. The other interesting thing, is, if even if you have constant acceleration, you could still figure out the distance by just taking the area under the curve like this. We were able to figure out there we were able to get 12.5 meters. The last thing I want to introduce you to-- actually, let me just do it until next video, and I'll introduce you to the idea of average velocity. Now that we feel comfortable with the idea, that the distance you traveled is the area under the velocity versus time curve.",science_ap-physics-1_ap-one-dimensional-motion
" - We have this big moment and the moment is that for 35 years of my teaching career I walked into the classroom having no idea if the kids had done the homework or what their commitment was to the subject. And then suddenly there's this coaching platform on Khan Academy that was a total game-changer for me. I wasn't imagining that the Khan Academy calculus content would become a big part of our curriculum. I imagined frankly and wrongly that we'd use these exercises, suggest kids use it for review. And when we discovered the coaching platform and how powerful that was, a group of us said, ""Let's give it a go. ""Let's try using Khan Academy ""as a major part of our curriculum."" And my goodness, it changed the way I teach. For instance, five minutes before I walk into class, I can go to the platform and I can look through my list of students to discover that all but two of them had done the homework, had watched the videos, had cleared the hurdle, if you will, of the exercises that I had given them. So, when I walked in the room, I didn't have to go over homework anymore. That was liberating. So, if there were two students who didn't do the homework, it gave me the opportunity to pull them aside and say, ""Hey, I see you didn't get to it,"" or, ""I see you struggled with it. ""Is there a way that you and I can meet later today? ""It's because I don't want you to get behind in this."" The first 15 minutes of class now all the sudden we're breaking new ground. We're doing harder problems. The kids responded so well to it because I think they had years and years and years of math teachers going over the homework for the first 15 minutes of class. The poor kids must've been bored to death, or, ""Why bother doing the homework because he'll do it on the board anyway?"" That was just totally liberating and gave me an opportunity to really think hard about teaching. Since we started using Khan Academy, the one thing that we can't help but notice is that we're having more kids make it to the end of BC Calculus, and it's clear to me that we're having more girls and more underrepresented kids finish our BC Calculus class than we ever did before. I gotta believe it's our new way about thinking about teaching. And using Khan Academy in the classroom and for homework assignments has gotta be a big part of that.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-limits-continuity
" -  We're asked to subtract negative six X to the fourth minus three X squared Y squared plus Y to the fourth from two X to the fourth minus eight X squared Y squared mins Y to the fourth. And I encourage you to pause this video and give it a try. Alright, let's work through it together. So We're gonna subtract this green polynomial from this magenta one. So we can rewrite this as, we're to actually perform it we could write two X to the fourth minus eight X squared Y squared minus Y to the fourth minus, and I'm gonna write this in parenthesis, give us some space, minus negative six X to the fourth minus three X squared Y squared plus five Y to the fourth. So notice, I'm subtracting this green polynomial in two variables from this magenta polynomial in two variables. Which is exactly what it says to do up here. So what's this going to be? Well I can just rewrite the magenta part. We're gonna have two X to the fourth minus eight X squared Y squared minus Y to the fourth. And then I can distribute this negative sign. So if we say the negative of negative six X to the fourth, that's gonna be positive six X to the fourth. So that's gonna go positive six X to the fourth. And then the negative of negative three X squared Y squared is going to be positive three X squared Y squared. So plus three X squared Y squared. And then last but not least, we have a negative, or we're subtracting positive five Y to the fourth. So that's going to be subtracting five Y to the fourth, or negative five Y to the fourth. And now we can try to simplify. So let's first look at this term right over here. We have two X to the fourths. And what we could look for is another X to the fourth term. And we see it right over here. So we have two X to the fourths and we can add that to six X to the fourths. So what's that going to be? Well if I have two of something, and then I add another six of that something, that's going to be eight X to the fourths, two plus six. Two X to the fourth plus six X to the fourth is going to be eight X to the fourth power. And now we have this X squared Y squared term. We could say we're subtracting eight of them. And over here we're adding three of these X squared Y squared terms. So we could add these coefficients. If we're taking away eight, but we're adding three we could view this as negative eight X squared Y squareds plus three X squared Y squareds. Well what's negative eight plus three? Well that's going to be negative five. Negative five X squareds Y squareds. So that's that term. Let me write that a little bit neater. That's this term right over here, don't forget to include this sign here. This is you're subtracting eight X squared Y squareds, you could do that as negative eight X squared Y squared plus three X squared Y squared. And then last but not least, you're subtracting one Y to the fourth, and then you're subtracting five more Y to the fourths. So what's that going to be? You could view this as negative one Y to the fourth minus five Y to the fourths. Well that's going to be negative one minus five is negative six. Negative six Y to the fourths. And we're done, we have subtracted this from that.",math_engageny-alg-1_alg1-1
" -  In this video, we're going to try to figure out what 0.6 or 6/10 divided by two is. And I'll give you a little bit of a hint. We have 6/10 plotted on the number line right over here. And so one way to think about it is, if I wanted to go from zero to 6/10 in two jumps, how big would each of those jumps have to be? Pause this video and try to figure that out on your own before we work through it together. All right, so as I mentioned, one way to think about it is how can I go from zero to 6/10 in two jumps? Two equal jumps, I should say. Well, if we just eyeball it right over here, I could do one jump like that and then another jump like that. So I did one jump and then two jumps. And so one way to think about it is we've divided 6/10 into two jumps, and each of those jumps are how far? Well, each of those jumps are one, two, 3/10. So this is 3/10 or I could write it like this, 3/10. We have another one, two, 3/10. So this is going to be equal to 3/10. And we've thought about it in other ways. If you have six of something and you divide it by two, you're going to have two groups of three of that something. So if you have 6/10, and you wanna put it into two equal groups, well, each of those groups are going to be 3/10.",math_cc-fifth-grade-math_divide-decimals
" - What I want to do in this video is find the arc length of one petal, I guess we could call it, of the graph of r is equal to four sine of two theta. So I want to find the length of this portion of the curve that is in red right over here. We'll do this in two phases. First of all I want to set up the definite integral for finding that arc length, and then we'll evaluate it. I'll actually use a calculator to evaluate it because it'll be a little bit more straightforward at least for this integral. Let's just start with that. I encourage you to pause the video. Knowing what we know about the formula for arc length, when we have it in polar form, see if you can apply it to figure out this arc length right over here. I'm assuming you've had a go at it, so let's remind ourselves that the arc length is going to be the integral from our starting angle to our ending angle, we'll call it from alpha to beta, of the square root of the derivative of our function. Which respect to theta squared, plus our function squared. Plus our function squared d theta. Let's figure out what r prime of theta and what r of theta actually are. I'll color code it. R prime of theta, we know what r of theta is let me just rewrite it. We know r of theta is equal to four sine of two theta. Our prime of theta is just going to be derivative of two theta with respect to theta is two times four is eight, derivative of sine is cosine, cosine of two theta. If we wanted to write the definite integral for arc length it's going to be equal to the definite integral. What's our starting bound? For the petal that we care about, we're going to start at an angle of zero radians. When we have an angle of zero radians, r is zero, that's this point right over here. We're going to start at zero radians. And we're going to go all the way up to pi over two. When sine of two times pi over two is sine of pi, which is zero, so we'll get back to this point right over here. We're going to go from zero to pi over two, to pi over two radians. It's going to be the square root of, give myself some real estate here, r prime of theta squared is going to be this thing squared. It's going to be 60-- Let me do it in that same blue color, it's going to be 64 cosine squared of two theta, then plus this squared which is going to be 16 sine squared of two theta, then of course we have our d theta. You can attempt to solve this or evaluate this analytically, it's not too straightforward so I'm going to use a calculator. It just gives us a practice with knowing that hey, there are tools out there that can help us do these types of things. I'll go to the definite integral, I'll go to second calculus on my t 85, I picked this choice, which is for the definite integral. Let me express when I'm taking the definite integral of, it's going to be the square root of 64 times cosine of two theta squared. I'm going to use x instead of theta just because it's an easier variable to use on my calculator. Cosine of two-- Actually let me make sure my parenthesis are good. Cosine of two x, alright I'll close that. Now I want to square that. I did that first part. Plus 16 times plus 16 times 16 times sine of two x. Close that, close that. Squared. I'm not sure if the calculator knows to interpret that as multiplication, so let me insert a times right over here. 64 times cosine of two x, that thing squared. Plus 16 times sine of two x, that thing squared. Let me go to the end. Let me close my radical, so that's going to close that right over there, that closes what I'm taking the square root of. Then comma, the variable that I'm integrating with respect to is x, in this case. Everywhere I saw theta here I'm just replacing with an x there. I want to do it from, instead of theta equals zero to theta equals pi over two, we'll say x is equal to zero to x is equal to pi over two. Hopefully I have not made a mistake when I've typed this in, And I get... It's chugging on a little bit. And we get... Will it actually come up? Oh finally! If we were to round it to the nearest thousandth it'll be nine point six eight eight. Approximately nine point six eight eight. Let's just see, does that make intuitive sense? It goes as far as four away, so if you just went out to four and then back down that would be about eight. Of course we have actually gone out some, so it actually makes intuitive sense that this arc length would be nine point six eight eight. Hopefully you enjoyed that.",math_integral-calculus_ic-adv-funcs
" Find the absolute value of x when x is equal to 5, x is equal to negative 10, and x is equal to negative 12. So the absolute value, the way of writing it is almost more complicated than what it really is. The absolute value is really just the distance of x from 0. So let me just draw a fast number line over here. So let's just put 0 right over here, since we're thinking about the distance from 0. So let's just think about the absolute value. Let's think about the absolute value of x when x is equal to 5. So that's equivalent to the absolute value of 5. We just substituted 5 for x. The absolute value of 5 is the distance of 5 from the 0. So you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5 is exactly 5 to the right of 0. So the absolute value of 5 is just 5. Now I think you already get to see this is a pretty straightforward concept. Now let's do something a little more interesting, the absolute value of x when x is equal to negative 10. So let's just put negative 10 in for x. This is the distance that negative 10 is from 0. And so let's just go negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4, negative 5, negative 6, negative 7, negative 8, negative 9, negative 10. I should extend the number line more. So this right here is negative 10. So how far is it away from 0? Well, it's 10 to the left of 0. So you put a 10 here. And so in general, absolute value will always be a positive quantity. And when we're rethinking about just absolute values of just numbers, it's just going to be, really, the positive version of that number. Let's do one more. Well, they tell us to do one more, the absolute value of x when x is equal to negative 12. So we have the absolute value of negative 12. We don't even to look at the number line. It's just going to be the positive version of negative 12. It's just going to be equal to 12. And this is just saying that negative 12 is 12 away from 0. And we could draw it over here. This is negative 11. Negative 12 is right over here. It is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 away from 0.",math_arithmetic_arith-review-negative-numbers
" -  If you didn't watch the last video because there was too much physics, I'll just quickly summarize what we talked about. We went over the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, which has one proton in its nucleus, so here's the positive charge in the nucleus, and a negatively charged electron orbiting the nucleus. And even though this is not reality, the Bohr model is not exactly what's happening, it is a useful model to think about. And so we just assumed the electron was going in this direction So counter-clockwise around which gives our electron a velocity tangent to our circle, which we said was v in the last video. And in the last video, we calculated this radius. So we calculated the radius of this circle, and we said this was equal to r one. So r one turned out to be five point three times 10 to the negative eleventh meters, which is an important number. And we also derived this equation, right. So r for any integer n is equal to n squared times r one, for example, if you wanted to calculate r one again. So the first allowed radius using the Bohr model is equal to one squared times r one. And so obviously one squared is one so r one is equal to five point three times 10 to the negative eleven meters. And so when n is equal to one, we said this was an electron in the ground state, in the lowest energy state for hydrogen. We'll talk about energy states in the next two videos. So this is a very important number here. So this is, this number right here, is the radius of the smallest orbit in the Bohr model. In the previous video, we also calculated the velocity or we came up with an equation that you could use to calculate the velocity of that electron. If you go back to the previous video, you'll see the equation that we derived was the velocity is equal to the integer n times Planck's constant divided by two pi m times r, and we figured this out using Bohr's assumption for quantised angular momentum and the classical idea of angular momentum. So if we plug in some numbers here, we can actually solve for the velocity of this electron cause we're gonna take this radius and we're gonna plug it in down here and then we know what these other numbers are. So we said n was equal to one, so we're talking about n is equal to one so we're going to plug a one to here. So this will be a one. The velocity is equal to one times Planck's constant, six point six two six times 10 to the negative 34 divided by two pi times m. And we're talking about the electron so m was the mass of our electron, which is nine point one one times 10 to the negative 31st kilograms. And finally, for n is equal to one, this was our allowed radius so we can plug this in for our radius, five point three times 10 to the negative 11. So if you do all that math, I won't take the time to do it here, but you'll get a velocity approximately equal to, approximate sign, two point two times 10 to the sixth and your units should work out to meters per second so that's the velocity. So going by the Bohr model, you can calculate the radius of this circle here so you can calculate this radius, and you can also calculate the velocity. And,again, this isn't reality but we'll use these numbers in later videos so it's important to figure out where they came from. So this is the radius of the smallest orbit allowed using the Bohr model but you can have other radii, and we can calculate the radii of larger orbits using this equation. So we're just gonna use different values for n. So we started off with n is equal to one. Let's use the same equation and let's do n is equal to two. So let me go ahead and rewrite that equation down here. Let's get some room. So r for any integer n is equal to n squared times r one. Let's do n is equal to two here. So n is equal to two so let's go ahead and plug in two. So we'd have two squared times r one. So r two, the second allowed radii or the second allowed radius I should say, is equal to four times r one. So if we're thinking about a picture, let's say this is the nucleus here and then this tiny, little radius here is r one. If we wanted to sketch in the second allowed one, it would be four times that so I'm just going to approximate. Let's say that radius is four times that so this is r two, which is equal to four times r one. And so we sketch in the radius of this next radius here, this next allowed radius, using the Bohr model. We could figure out mathematically what that's equal to because we know r one is equal to five point three times 10 to the negative 11 meters. And so if you do that calculation, four times that number gives you approximately two point one two times 10 to the negative 10th meters. So this is our second radius when n is equal to two. Let's do one more when n is equal to three so let's get a little bit more room here. So when n is equal to three, this radius will be equal to three squared times r one. So once again, we're just taking three and plugging it into here and so three squared is, of course, nine. So this would be equal to nine times r one so our next allowed radius will be nine times r one. And I'm sure I won't get this accurate, but it's a lot bigger. So this will be r three is equal to nine times r one. So I won't even attempt to draw in that circle, but you get the idea. And we could do that math as well, so nine times five point three times 10 to the negative 11 meters would give you approximately four point seven seven times 10 to the negative 10th meters. And so these are the different allowed radii using the Bohr model so you can say that the orbit radii are quantised, only certain radii are allowed so you couldn't get something in between. You couldn't have something in between in here according to the Bohr model so this is not possible. And these radii are associated with different energies and that's gonna be really important and that's really why we're doing these calculations. So we're getting these different radii here and each one of these radii is associated with a different energy. So, again, more to come in the next few videos about energy, which is probably more important.",science_physics_quantum-physics
"  So, the next organ we're going to talk about in our tour to abdomen is the pancreas. And I've drawn the pancreas right here. Let me just write that out. This is our pancreas, which I believe you may have heard about before. The pancreas sits below and behind the stomach, and it kind of hugs the first part of our small intestine here, which I think you may now recognize as called the duodenum. In fact, it wraps around a little more than what I've drawn right here. But just know that it sits back, way back over here. In fact, some say that the pancreas sits in a completely separate compartment from our stomach, our small intestine, our large intestine, even our liver. It sits not in the peritoneum. The peritoneum is where the rest of our gut sit. The peritoneum is just a fancy word for the abdomen. So, our stomach sits in our peritoneum, our liver sits in our peritoneum, the small intestine, the large intestine, all these guys sit in our peritoneum. But our pancreas is different because it sits in the retroperitoneum. And when we say retroperitoneum, that means it sits in the back of the abdomen. Now, it's not they're alone. A lot of our big vessels that run through the abdomen are also there. The abdominal aorta, the inferior vena cava, these things you may have heard of elsewhere. But it sits in this very different compartment. And in fact, medical professionals, the pancreas is actually a force to be reckoned with, for a couple of reasons. First of all, it releases a bunch of powerful enzymes. Powerful enzymes that we're going to talk about in a minute. And these powerful enzymes can digest a whole bunch of our macromolecules. Things that we eat, but also the things that line our cell membranes or make up other parts of our body. Not just in the retroperitoneum but in the peritoneum, the thorax, everywhere else in our body. So, it releases powerful enzymes. And two, the pancreas is little strange in that it's unencapsulated, unencapsulated, which is different from other organs like the liver. The liver has got the liver capsule. The kidney is covered by its own capsule, but the pancreas is essentially just a slurry of cells that's hanging somehow in the retroperitoneum. And that makes it a little difficult, especially for surgeons that have to operate nearby. You don't want to mess with the pancreas because it's got all these powerful enzymes that could cause a lot of damage around it if they were released. No wonder then, the pancreas has sort of earned itself a special nick name. Many physicians consider the pancreas to be the lion of the abdomen because of how important it is, and additionally, how powerful the enzymes are that come from it. So just like the lion in the jungle, you don't want to mess with the pancreas. So let's take a few minutes then and talk about what makes the pancreas so special. Physiologically, the pancreas releases two types of things or has two main components to it. One, there is the exocrine pancreas. And the idea behind the exocrine pancreas is that it takes salts, and I'll write it down here, enzymes. So, these powerful enzymes I talked about earlier. It takes these salts and enzymes and releases them in the duodenum or the duo-denum. And I think you remember where that is. That's the first part of the small intestine right after the stomach. And so our exocrine pancreas has four main roles that it accomplishes. So, firstly as you may recall. Because the pancreas releases its contents into the duodenum, think about what the duodenum is receiving right beforehand. As we talked about in the video on the stomach, we're getting a whole bunch of chyme that's been digested by gastric acid or hydrochloric acid. And so we'll need something to neutralize all that acid. And so the exocrine pancreas release bicarbonate. The bicarbonate here will serve to neutralize our gastric acid. So, we will neutralize the pH or the very low pH that we're receiving from the stomach in the form of gastric acid. And remember again, the gastric acid is hydrochloric acid. Next, as we move on, we will talk about some of those powerful enzymes that we discussed earlier. One of them that we briefly mentioned when we were talking about the mouth, is amylase. And if you recall, amylase is responsible for the breakdown of the starch. And if you remember, starch is just a whole bunch of carbohydrates stacked upon one another. And we break down starch into our smaller carbohydrates. So, I'll just write smaller carbs for right now. And so that will include things like those glucose monomers or even disaccharides. And then another enzyme that we also release from the exocrine pancreas into the duodenum is something called lipase. And lipase should be another throwback to the mouth because its name suggest that it breaks down lipids. So, specifically it will take triglycerides, which I can draw here. So, here is a triglyceride, right there. And you've got these fatty acid chains that are coming off the glycerol head. It will take triglycerides and it will break them down into free fatty acids. And so those will look like this. So that's the acid part and here's the fatty acid part, as well as things like monoglycerides. And monoglycerides look like this. And we're calling them mono because they've only got one fatty acid chain on them. We could also have diglycerides, which I think you might be able to guess what these guys look like. If I draw them out like here. Diglycerides are going to have two fatty acid chains on them. There you go. And then it also will release glycerol, glycerol. And glycerol is what happens when you get rid of all your fatty acid chains. And so you'll have some of these guys and they're all ... OH is right here. So that's what your lipase will do, and it's similar to the lingual lipase that you had in your mouth. But in the mouth, it was mainly for taste when you digested your triglyceride. In the duodenum, this enzyme works to break down triglycerides in a greater manner. And then finally, the last function of the exocrine pancreas involves its proteolytic enzymes. I'll just write proteolytic right here. And I'll expand. There are two types of proteolytic enzymes. There is trypsinogen that it releases, trypsinogen. There is trypsinogen and there is also chymo. This is a longer word, chymotrypsinogen. Trypsinogen. And I think there is a couple of light bulbs that should be coming on right now because whenever you see the suffix ""ogen"" as we see down here. That refers to something that's called a zymogen. A zymogen, which means an enzyme that is inactive right now because it has an extra bond. Usually, a peptide bond that needs to be broken in order for it to start doing its thing. So, trypsinogen is the inactive form of trypsin. Just like how chymotrypsinogen is the inactive form of chymotrypsin. And these guys need to be activated. And the way that's done is in the duodenum. There is an enzyme that sits there called enteropeptidase. There is a whole bunch of enteropeptidases that line the duodenum. Your enteropeptidase will break down trypsinogen to form trypsin. Trypsin is the active form that's then going to be able to break down proteins. And what we're doing here is actually causing a chain reaction. Because once trypsin is formed, the next step in activating chymotrypsinogen is accomplished by trypsin. Trypsin will cleave your chymotrypsinogen to form, and this is a very long word, chymotrypsin, chymotrypsin. And these guys will go wreak havoc and break down proteins in the duodenum. Now, my question to you is these are enzymes and they're inactive because of usually a single bond. But what happens when that bond that makes them inactive breaks? Say, if you're in a car accident and you get hit in the stomach and there was enough force there that can provide activation energy to break a bond and turn trypsinogen into trypsin. What would happen? Well, as we mentioned earlier, because the pancreas is unencapsulated, activated trypsin will go on to activate chymotrypsinogen into the chymotrypsin and then will break down proteins wherever they see them. And that can be membrane proteins. They could be proteins that are in the surface of the duodenum. They could be proteins that we digested in our food or they could be proteins that are present in the pancreas. So you can see why the pancreas is so feared. And that's why the pancreas is something you don't want to have damaged. Because we can activate these deadly enzymes that should be working in the duodenum.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" -  We're gonna do in this video is try to evaluate the definite integral from zero to pi of x cosine of x dx. Like always, pause this video and see if you can evaluate it yourself. Well when you immediately look at this, it's not obvious how you just straight up take the anti-derivative here and then evaluate that at pi and then subtract from that and evaluate it at zero, so we're probably going to have to use a slightly more sophisticated technique. And in general, if you see a product of functions right over here, and if one of these functions is fairly straightforward to take the anti-derivative of without making it more complicated like cosine of x, and another of the functions like x if you were to take its derivative, it gets simpler. In this case, it would just become one. It's a pretty good sign that we should be using integration by parts. So let's just remind ourselves about integration by parts. So integration by parts, I'll do it right over here, if I have the integral and I'll just write this as an indefinite integral but here we wanna take the indefinite integral and then evaluate it at pi and evaluate it at zero, so if I have f of x times g prime of x, dx, this is going to be equal to, and in other videos we prove this, it really just comes straight out of the product rule that you learned in differential calculus, this is gonna be equal to f of x times g of x minus, you then swap these around, minus f prime of x, g of x, dx. And just to reiterate what I said before, you wanna find an f of x that when I take its derivative, it simplifies it, so simplify, and you wanna find a g prime of x that when I take its anti-derivative, so when I take its anti-derivative, it doesn't get more complicated. So not more complicated. Because if the f of x gets simplified when I take its derivative, and the g prime of x does not get more complicated when I take its anti-derivative, then this expression will maybe be easier to find the anti-derivative of. So let's do that over here. Between x and cosine of x, which one gets more simple when I take its derivative? Well the derivative of x is just one, so I'm gonna make that my f of x, so I could write that over here, so my f of x, I will say is x, in which case, f prime of x, f prime of x, is going to be equal to one, and then what would my g prime of x be? Well my g prime of x, cosine of x if I take its anti-derivative, it doesn't get more complicated. The anti-derivative of cosine of x is sine of x. So let me make that my g prime of x. So g prime of x is equal to cosine of x in which case g of x, the anti-derivative of cosine of x, well it's just sine of x or another way to think about it, the derivative of sine of x is cosine of x. Now you could think about plus C's and all of that but remember, this is gonna be a definite integral so all of those arbitrary constants are going to get canceled out. So now let's think through this. Let's just apply the integration by parts here. In this particular case, all of this is going to be equal to, so I'm saying that is equal to this, I'm gonna skip down here, it's going to be equal to f of x times g of x. So that is f of x is x, g of x is sine of x, f of x times g of x, minus the integral of f prime of x, f prime of x is just one, we could write it like that, one times g of x, g of x is sine of x, so we could write it like this, but one times sine of x, well we could just rewrite that as sine of x, it'll make it a little bit simpler, sine of x, dx, and then remember, this is a definite integral, so we are going to want to evaluate this whole thing at pi and at zero, and then take the difference between the two. But what is the indefinite integral of sine of x dx? Well, or to say the anti-derivative of it, we know that the derivative of cosine is negative sine of x, and so in fact what we want, we could bring this negative sine into the integral, so we could say plus the integral of negative sine of x, now this clearly the anti-derivative here is cosine of x, so this thing is going to be cosine of x, and now we just have to evaluate it at the end points. So let's first evaluate this whole thing at pi. So this is going to be equal to pi sine of pi, pi sine of pi, plus cosine of pi, and then from that I'm going to subtract this whole thing evaluated at zero, so let me do zero in a different color, at zero, so it's going to be zero times sine of zero plus cosine of zero, so let's see, sine of pi is just zero so this is just going to cancel out. Cosine of pi, that is negative one, and then this is zero, and then cosine of zero, that is one, so you have negative one minus one, so this all gets us to negative two, and we are done. Using integration by parts, we were able to evaluate this definite integral.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-integration-new
" -  Joey used 0.432 pounds of cheese to make mac-and-cheese for dinner, and we could also call this 432/1,000 pounds of cheese to make mac-and-cheese for dinner. Round the amount of cheese to the nearest tenth. So the amount of cheese once again is 0.432 pounds and just remember the places here. This is 4/10, so that's the tenths place. This is the hundredths place, and that's an S there, so tenths, hundredths, and this right over here is thousandths, thousandths place. So we wanna round to the nearest tenth. So we're gonna round to the nearest tenth. We go one place to the right. If it's five or larger, we round up. This would become a five. If it's less than five, well, if it's less than five, which is the case here, we're gonna round down to just 4/10 even. So because three is less than five, we are going to round down, and we're going to get 0.400, or we could write that as 0.4, or we could write that as 4/10 of a pound. Let's do another one. Eliza's pet snail traveled 2.197 meters in one day. Round the distance to the nearest hundredth. So pause this video and see if you can do that. Round the distance to the nearest hundredth. So it's 2.197. This is the hundredths place right over here, and so if we're gonna round to the nearest hundredth, we're gonna go one place to the right. If this one place to the right is five or greater, we're gonna round up, and seven is five or greater, so we are going to round up . Now this is interesting 'cause if you round a nine up, you get to 10, but you can't put a whole 10 right over here. So one way to think about it is you have a 19 here, and so if you round up, you're gonna go to a 20, or another way to think about it. If you round the nine up, you're gonna go to the next tenth. So this is going to be 2 point, you could view this as 19/100 or 19/100 and 7/1,000, and so now we're gonna round up to 20/100, so 2.20. We're rounding to the nearest hundredth, which you could write as 2.2, but to make it clear that you're rounding to the nearest hundredth, you're gonna write 2.20, and later in your life, this actually might matter to actually show what you're rounding to. Let's do another example here. Cassandra spends 6.75 hours each day at school. Round the amount of time to the nearest hour. Alright, so 6.75, so you might be a little confused, and actually, I encourage you to pause the video again and try to solve it on your own. So you might be a little confused 'cause they're not saying round it to the nearest tenth or hundredth or one or 10 or 100. They're saying to the nearest hour, but in this case, the hour is the ones place. So if we're gonna round to the nearest hour, this is another way of saying round to the nearest one. So we're gonna round to the nearest one. We go one place to the right. We go to look at the tenths place. If it's five or larger, we round up. Well, seven is five or larger, so we round up to the next hour, which is going to be seven, so seven hours. If this was 6.49999, once again, if we're rounding to the nearest hour, we go one place to the right. It doesn't matter that we have all these nines here. We'd say, hey, look, four is less than five. Therefore, we should round down, round down, and you would round down to the next hour. Well, the next hour that's below 6.499999, nine, nine, nine, nine, is six hours, but in this case, we had a seven in the tenths place, which is definitely greater than or equal to five, and so we'd round up to the next hour, which is seven hours.",math_in-in-class-5th-math-cbse_imp-place-value-and-decimals
" -  A quality control expert at a drink bottling factory took a random sample of bottles from a batch and measured the amount of liquid in each bottle in the sample. The amounts in the sample had a mean of 503 milliliters and a standard deviation of five milliliters. They want to test if this is convincing evidence that the mean amount for bottles in this batch is different than the target value of 500 milliliters. Let mu be the mean amount of liquid in each bottle in the batch. Write an appropriate set of hypotheses for their significance test, for the significance test that the quality control expert is running. So pause this video and see if you can do that. Now, let's do this together. So first, you're going to have two hypotheses. You're gonna have your null hypothesis and your alternative hypothesis. Your null hypothesis is going to be a hypothesis about the population parameter that you care about and it's going to assume kind of the status quo. No news here. And so the parameter that we care about is the mean amount of liquid in the bottles in the batch. So that's mu right over there. And what would be the assumption that that would be, the no news here? Well, it would be 500 milliliters. That's the target value. So, it's reasonable to say, well, the null is doing what it's supposed to, that where the actual mean for the batch is actually what the target needs to be, it's actually 500 milliliters. Some of you might have said, hey wait, didn't they say the amounts in the sample had a mean of 503 milliliters? Why isn't this 503? Remember, your hypothesis is going to be about the population parameter. Your assumption about the population parameter. This 503 milliliters right over here, this is a sample statistic. This is a sample mean that's trying to estimate this thing right over here. When we do our significance test, we're going to incorporate this 503 milliliters. We're going to think about, well, what's the probability of getting a sample statistic, a sample mean this far or further away from the assumed mean if we assume that the null hypothesis is true, and if that probability is below a threshold, our significance level, then we reject the null hypothesis and it would suggest the alternative. But if we're just trying to generate or write a set of hypotheses, this would be our null hypothesis, and then our alternative hypothesis is that the true mean for the batch is something different than 500 milliliters.",math_ap-statistics_tests-significance-ap
"  We know from the last video that if we have a high calcium ion concentration inside of the muscle cell, those calcium ions will bond to the troponin proteins which will then change their shape in such a way that the tropomyosin will be moved out of the way and so then the myosin heads can crawl along the actin filaments and them we'll actually have muscle contractions. So high calcium concentration, or calcium ion concentration, we have contraction. Low calcium ion concentration, these troponin proteins go to their standard confirmation and they pull-- or you can say they move the tropomyosin back in the way of the myosin heads-- and we have no contraction.  So the next obvious question is, how does the muscle regulate whether we have high calcium concentration and contraction or low calcium concentration and relaxation? Or even a better question is, how does the nervous system do it? How does the nervous system tell the muscle to contract, to make its calcium concentration high and contract or to make it low again and relax? And to understand that, let's do a little bit a review of what we learned on the videos on neurons. Let me draw the terminal junction of an axon right here. Instead of having a synapse with a dendrite of another neuron, it's going to have a synapse with an actual muscle cell. So this is its synapse with the actual muscle cell.  This is a synapse with an actual muscle cell. Let me label everything just so you don't get confused. This is the axon. We could call it the terminal end of an axon.  This is the synapse.  Just a little terminology from the neuron videos-- this space was a synaptic cleft. This is the presynaptic neuron. This is-- I guess you could kind of view it-- the post-synaptic cell. It's not a neuron in this case. And then just so we have-- this is our membrane of muscle cell. And I'm going to do-- probably the next video or maybe a video after that, I'll actually show you the anatomy of a muscle cell. In this, it'll be a little abstract because we really want to understand how the calcium ion concentration is regulated. This is called a sarcolemma.  So this is the membrane of the muscle cell. And this right here-- you could imagine it's just a fold into the membrane of the muscle cell. If I were to look at the surface of the muscle cell, then it would look like a little bit of a hole or an indentation that goes into the cell, but here we did a cross section so you can imagine it folding in, but if you poked it in with a needle or something, this is what you would get. You would get a fold in the membrane. And this right here is called a T-tubule.  And the T just stands for transverse. It's going transverse to the surface of the membrane. And over here-- and this is the really important thing in this video, or the really important organelle in this video. You have this organelle inside of the muscle cell called the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  And it actually is very similar to an endoplasmic reticulum in somewhat of what it is or maybe how it's related to an endoplasmic reiticulum-- but here its main function is storage. While an endoplasmic reticulum, it's involved in protein development and it has ribosomes attached to it, but this is purely a storage organelle. What the sarcoplasmic reticulum does it has calcium ion pumps on its membrane and what these do is they're ATP ases, which means that they use ATP to fuel the pump. So you have ATP come in, ATP attaches to it, and maybe a calcium ion will attach to it, and when the ATP hydrolyzes into ADP plus a phosphate group, that changes the confirmation of this protein and it pumps the calcium ion in. So the calcium ions get pumped in. So the net effect of all of these calcium ion pumps on the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum is in a resting muscle, we'll have a very high concentration of calcium ions on the inside.  Now, I think you could probably guess where this is going. When the muscle needs to contract, these calcium ions get dumped out into the cytoplasm of the cell. And then they're able to bond to the troponin right here, and do everything we talked about in the last video. So what we care about is, just how does it know when to dump its calcium ions into the rest of the cell? This is the inside of the cell.  And so this area is what the actin filaments and the myosin heads and all of the rest, and the troponin, and the tropomyosin-- they're all exposed to the environment that is over here. So you can imagine-- I could just draw it here just to make it clear.  I'm drawing it very abstract. We'll see more of the structure in a future video.  This is a very abstract drawing, but I think this'll give you a sense of what's going on. So let's say this neuron-- and we'll call this a motor neuron-- it's signaling for a muscle contraction. So first of all, we know how signals travel across neurons, especially across axons with an action potential. We could have a sodium channel right here. It's voltage gated so you have a little bit of a positive voltage there. That tells this voltage gated sodium channel to open up. So it opens up and allows even more of the sodium to flow in. That makes it a little bit more positive here. So then that triggers the next voltage gated channel to open up-- and so it keeps traveling down the membrane of the axon-- and eventually, when you get enough of a positive threshold, voltage gated calcium channels open up.  This is all a review of what we learned in the neuron videos. So eventually, when it gets positive enough close to these calcium ion channels, they allow the calcium ions to flow in. And the calcium ions flow in and they bond to those special proteins near the synaptic membrane or the presynaptic membrane right there. These are calcium ions. They bond to proteins that were docking vesicles. Remember, vesicles were just these membranes around neurotransmitters.  When the calcium binds to those proteins, it allows exocytosis to occur. It allows the membrane of the vesicles to merge with the membrane of the actual neuron and the contents get dumped out. This is all review from the neuron videos. I explained it in much more detail in those videos, but you have-- all of these neurotransmitters get dumped out. And we were talking about the synapse between a neuron and a muscle cell. The neurotransmitter here is acetylcholine.  But just like what would happen at a dendrite, the acetylcholine binds to receptors on the sarcolemma or the membrane of the muscle cell and that opens sodium channels on the muscle cell. So the muscle cell also has a a voltage gradient across its membrane, just like a neuron does. So when this guy gets some acetylcholene, it allows sodium to flow inside the muscle cell. So you have a plus there and that causes an action potential in the muscle cell. So then you have a little bit of a positive charge. If it gets high enough to a threshold level, it'll trigger this voltage gated channel right here, which will allow more sodium to flow in. So it'll become a little bit positive over here. Of course, it also has potassium to reverse it. It's just like what's going on in a neuron. So eventually this action potential-- you have a sodium channel over here. It gets a little bit positive. When it gets enough positive, then it opens up and allows even more sodium to flow in. So you have this action potential. and then that action potential-- so you have a sodium channel over here-- it goes down this T-tubule. So the information from the neuron-- you could imagine the 1action potential then turns into kind of a chemical signal 1which triggers another action potential that 1goes down the T-tubule. 1And this is the interesting part-- and actually this is an 1area of open research right now and I'll give you some 1leads if you want to read more about this research-- is that 1you have a protein complex that essentially bridges the 1sarcoplasmic reticulum to the T-tubule. 1And I'll just draw it as a big box right here. 1So you have this protein complex right there. 1And I'll actually show it-- people believe-- I'll sort 1some words out here. 1It involves the proteins triadin, junctin, 1calsequestrin, and ryanodine. 1 1But they're somehow involved in a protein complex here that 1bridges between the T-tubule the sarcoplasmic verticulum, 1but the big picture is what happens when this action 1potential travels down here-- so we get positive enough 1right around here, this complex of proteins triggers 1the release of calcium. 1And they think that the ryanodine is actually the part 1that actually releases the calcium, but we could just say 1that it-- maybe it's triggered right here. 1When the action potential travels down-- let me switch 1to another color. 1I'm using this purple too much. 1When the action potential gets far enough-- I'll use red 1right here-- when the action potential gets far enough-- so 1this environment gets a little positive with all those sodium 1ions flowing in, this mystery box-- and you could do web 1searches for these proteins. 1People are still trying to understand exactly how this 1mystery box works-- it triggers an opening for all of 1these calcium ions to escape the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 1So then all these calcium ions get dumped into the outside of 1the sarcoplasmic reticulum into-- just the inside of the 1cell, into the cytoplasm of the cell. 1Now when that happens, what's doing to happen? 1Well, the high calcium concentration, the calcium 1ions bond to the troponin, just like what we said at the 1beginning of the video. 1The calcium ions bond to the troponin, move the tropomyosin 1out of the way, and then the myosin using ATP like we 1learned two videos ago can start crawling up the actin-- 1and at the same time, once the signal disappears, this thing 1shuts down and then these calcium ion pumps will reduce 1the calcium ion concentration again. 1And then our contraction will stop and the muscle will get 1relaxed again. 1So the whole big thing here is that we have this container of 1calcium ions that, when the muscles relax, is essentially 1taking the calcium ions out of the inside of the cell so the 1muscle is relaxed so that you can't have your myosin climb 1up the actin. 1But then when it gets the signal, it dumps it back in 1and then we actually have a muscle contraction because the 1tropomyosin gets moved out of the way by the troponin., So I 1don't know. That's pretty fascinating. 1It's actually even fascinating that this is still not 1completely well understood. 1This is an active-- if you want to become a biological 1researcher, this could be an interesting thing to try to 1understand. 1One, it's interesting just from a scientific point of 1view of how this actually functions, but there's 1actually-- there's maybe potential diseases that are 1byproducts of malfunctioning proteins right here. 1Maybe you can somehow make these things perform better or 1worse, or who knows. 1So there actually are positive impacts that you could have if 1you actually figured out what exactly is going on here when 1the action potential shows up to open up 1this calcium channel. 1So now we have the big picture. 1We know how a motor neuron can stimulate a contraction of a 1cell by allowing the sarcoplasmic reticulum to 1allow calcium ions to travel across this membrane in the 1cytoplasm of the cell. 1And I was doing a little bit of reading before this video. 1These pumps are very efficient. 1So once the signal goes away and this door is closed right 1here, this this sarcoplasmic reticulum can get back the ion 1concentration in about 30 milliseconds. 1So that's why we're so good at stopping contractions, why I 1can punch and then pull back my arm and then have it relax 1all within split-seconds because we can stop the 1contraction in 30 milliseconds, which is less 1than 1/30 of a second. 1So anyway, I'll see in the next video, where we'll study 1the actual anatomy of a muscle cell in a 1little bit more detail. 1",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" I will now show you my preferred way of finding an inverse of a 3 by 3 matrix. And I actually think it's a lot more fun. And you're less likely to make careless mistakes. But if I remember correctly from Algebra 2, they didn't teach it this way in Algebra 2. And that's why I taught the other way initially. But let's go through this. And in a future video, I will teach you why it works. Because that's always important. But in linear algebra, this is one of the few subjects where I think it's very important learn how to do the operations first. And then later, we'll learn the why. Because the how is very mechanical. And it really just involves some basic arithmetic for the most part. But the why tends to be quite deep. So I'll leave that to later videos. And you can often think about the depth of things when you have confidence that you at least understand the hows. So anyway, let's go back to our original matrix. And what was that original matrix that I did in the last video? It was 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1. And we wanted to find the inverse of this matrix. So this is what we're going to do. It's called Gauss-Jordan elimination, to find the inverse of the matrix. And the way you do it-- and it might seem a little bit like magic, it might seem a little bit like voodoo, but I think you'll see in future videos that it makes a lot of sense. What we do is we augment this matrix. What does augment mean? It means we just add something to it. So I draw a dividing line. Some people don't. So if I put a dividing line here. And what do I put on the other side of the dividing line? I put the identity matrix of the same size. This is 3 by 3, so I put a 3 by 3 identity matrix. So that's 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1. All right, so what are we going to do? What I'm going to do is perform a series of elementary row operations. And I'm about to tell you what are valid elementary row operations on this matrix. But whatever I do to any of these rows here, I have to do to the corresponding rows here. And my goal is essentially to perform a bunch of operations on the left hand side. And of course, the same operations will be applied to the right hand side, so that I eventually end up with the identity matrix on the left hand side. And then when I have the identity matrix on the left hand side, what I have left on the right hand side will be the inverse of this original matrix. And when this becomes an identity matrix, that's actually called reduced row echelon form. And I'll talk more about that. There's a lot of names and labels in linear algebra. But they're really just fairly simple concepts. But anyway, let's get started and this should become a little clear. At least the process will become clear. Maybe not why it works. So first of all, I said I'm going to perform a bunch of operations here. What are legitimate operations? They're called elementary row operations. So there's a couple things I can do. I can replace any row with that row multiplied by some number. So I could do that. I can swap any two rows. And of course if I swap say the first and second row, I'd have to do it here as well. And I can add or subtract one row from another row. So when I do that-- so for example, I could take this row and replace it with this row added to this row. And you'll see what I mean in the second. And you know, if you combine it, you could you could say, well I'm going to multiple this row times negative 1, and add it to this row, and replace this row with that. So if you start to feel like this is something like what you learned when you learned solving systems of linear equations, that's no coincidence. Because matrices are actually a very good way to represent that, and I will show you that soon. But anyway, let's do some elementary row operations to get this left hand side into reduced row echelon form. Which is really just a fancy way of saying, let's turn it into the identity matrix. So let's see what we want to do. We want to have 1's all across here. We want these to be 0's. Let's see how we can do this efficiently. Let me draw the matrix again. So let's get a 0 here. That would be convenient. So I'm going to keep the top two rows the same. 1, 0, 1. I have my dividing line. 1, 0, 0. I didn't do anything there. I'm not doing anything to the second row. 0, 2, 1. 0, 1, 0. And what I'm going to do, I'm going to replace this row-- And just so you know my motivation, my goal is to get a 0 here. So I'm a little bit closer to having the identity matrix here. So how do I get a 0 here? What I could do is I can replace this row with this row minus this row. So I can replace the third row with the third row minus the first row. So what's the third row minus the first row? 1 minus 1 is 0. 1 minus 0 is 1. 1 minus 1 is 0. Well I did it on the left hand side, so I have to do it on the right hand side. I have to replace this with this minus this. So 0 minus 1 is minus 1. 0 minus 0 is 0. And 1 minus 0 is 1. Fair enough. Now what can I do? Well this row right here, this third row, it has 0 and 0-- it looks a lot like what I want for my second row in the identity matrix. So why don't I just swap these two rows? Why don't I just swap the first and second rows? So let's do that. I'm going to swap the first and second rows. So the first row stays the same. 1, 0, 1. And then the other side stays the same as well. And I'm swapping the second and third rows. So now my second row is now 0, 1, 0. And I have to swap it on the right hand side. So it's minus 1, 0, 1. I'm just swapping these two. So then my third row now becomes what the second row was here. 0, 2, 1. And 0, 1, 0. Fair enough. Now what do I want to do? Well it would be nice if I had a 0 right here. That would get me that much closer to the identity matrix. So how could I get as 0 here? Well what if I subtracted 2 times row two from row one? Because this would be, 1 times 2 is 2. And if I subtracted that from this, I'll get a 0 here. So let's do that. So the first row has been very lucky. It hasn't had to do anything. It's just sitting there. 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0. And the second row's not changing for now. Minus 1, 0, 1. Now what did I say I was going to do? I'm going to subtract 2 times row two from row three. So this is 0 minus 2 times 0 is 0. 2 minus 2 times 1, well that's 0. 1 minus 2 times 0 is 1. 0 minus 2 times negative 1 is-- so let's remember 0 minus 2 times negative 1. So that's 0 minus negative 2, so that's positive 2. 1 minus 2 times 0. Well that's just still 1. 0 minus 2 times 1. So that's minus 2. Have I done that right? I just want to make sure. 0 minus 2 times-- right, 2 times minus 1 is minus 2. And I'm subtracting it, so it's plus. OK, so I'm close. This almost looks like the identity matrix or reduced row echelon form. Except for this 1 right here. So I'm finally going to have to touch the top row. And what can I do? well how about I replace the top row with the top row minus the bottom row? Because if I subtract this from that, this'll get a 0 there. So let's do that. So I'm replacing the top row with the top row minus the third row. So 1 minus 0 is 1. 0 minus 0 is 0. 1 minus 1 is 0. That was our whole goal. And then 1 minus 2 is negative 1. 0 minus 1 is negative 1. 0 minus negative 2., well that's positive 2. And then the other rows stay the same. 0, 1, 0, minus 1, 0, 1. And then 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, negative 2. And there you have it. We have performed a series of operations on the left hand side. And we've performed the same operations on the right hand side. This became the identity matrix, or reduced row echelon form. And we did this using Gauss-Jordan elimination. And what is this? Well this is the inverse of this original matrix. This times this will equal the identity matrix. So if this is a, than this is a inverse. And that's all you have to do. And as you could see, this took me half the amount of time, and required a lot less hairy mathematics than when I did it using the adjoint and the cofactors and the determit. And if you think about it, I'll give you a little hint of why this worked. 1Every one of these operations I did on the left hand side, 1you could kind of view them as multiplying-- you know, to get 1from here to here, I multiplied. 1You can kind of say that there's a matrix. 1That if I multiplied by that matrix, it would have 1performed this operation. 1And then I would have had to multiply by another matrix to 1do this operation. 1So essentially what we did is we multiplied by a series of 1matrices to get here. 1And if you multiplied all of those, what we call 1elimination matrices, together, you essentially 1multiply this times the inverse. 1So what am I saying? 1So if we have a, to go from here to here, we have to 1multiply a times the elimination matrix. 1And this might be completely confusing for you, so ignore 1it if it is, but it might be insightful. 1So what did we eliminate in this? 1We eliminated 3, 1. 1We multiplied by the elimination matrix 13, 1, to get here. 1And then, to go from here to here, we've 1multiplied by some matrix. 1And I'll tell you more. 1I'll show you how we can construct 1these elimination matrices. 1We multiply by an elimination matrix. 1Well actually, we had a row swap here. 1I don't know what you want to call that. 1You could call that the swap matrix. 1We swapped row two for three. 1And then here, we multiplied by elimination 1matrix-- what did we do? 1We eliminated this, so this was row three, 1column two, 3, 2. 1And then finally, to get here, we had to multiply by 1elimination matrix. 1We had to eliminate this right here. 1So we eliminated row one, column three. 1And I want you to know right now that it's not important 1what these matrices are. 1I'll show you how we can construct these matrices. 1But I just want you to have kind of a leap of faith that 1each of these operations could have been done by multiplying 1by some matrix. 1But what we do know is by multiplying by all of these 1matrices, we essentially got the identity matrix. 1Back here. 1So the combination of all of these matrices, when you 1multiply them by each other, this must 1be the inverse matrix. 1If I were to multiply each of these elimination and row swap 1matrices, this must be the inverse matrix of a. 1Because if you multiply all them times 1a, you get the inverse. 1Well what happened? 1If these matrices are collectively the inverse 1matrix, if I do them, if I multiply the identity matrix 1times them-- the elimination matrix, this one times that 1equals that. 1This one times that equals that. 1This one times that equals that. 1And so forth. 1I'm essentially multiplying-- when you combine all of 1these-- a inverse times the identity matrix. 1So if you think about it just very big picture-- and I don't 1want to confuse you. 1It's good enough at this point if you just 1understood what I did. 1But what I'm doing from all of these steps, I'm essentially 1multiplying both sides of this augmented matrix, you could 1call it, by a inverse. 1So I multiplied this by a inverse, to get to the 1identity matrix. 1But of course, if I multiplied the inverse matrix times the 1identity matrix, I'll get the inverse matrix. 1But anyway, I don't want to confuse you. 1Hopefully that'll give you a little intuition. 1I'll do this later with some more concrete examples. 1But hopefully you see that this is a lot less hairy than 1the way we did it with the adjoint and the cofactors and 1the minor matrices and the determits, et cetera. 1Anyway, I'll see you in the next video.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-matrices
" Solve for x and y. And we have two equations with two unknowns. Negative 3y plus 4x is equal to 11, and y plus 2x is equal to 13. What we could do is try to solve this using elimination. Maybe we can add these two equations together to get some variables to cancel out. But if we just add y and negative 3y, those won't cancel out. And if we just add a 2x and 4x, those won't cancel out. But maybe we can scale one of these equations, so that we will get some cancellation. If this y could somehow become a 3y, then 3y and negative 3y would cancel out. And so the easiest way to turn this y into a 3y is to just multiply this entire equation, so we don't actually change the information in it, by 3. So let's multiply both sides by 3. If we multiply the left-hand side by 3, we get 3y plus 6x. We have to multiply every term by 3. 3y plus 6x is equal to 3 times 13 is 39. So this equation and this equation are the exact same equation. I've just multiplied both sides by 3 to go from here to here. So I multiplied by 3. And of course, we have this original equation up here. That negative 3y plus 4x is equal to 11. And now, if we add the left-hand side and the right-hand sides of this equation, something interesting happens. The negative 3y and the positive 3y cancel out. That was the whole point behind multiplying this second guy over here by 3. So let's add them. So if we add, these guys cancel out. We have 4x plus 6x is 10x. And that is equal to 11 plus 39, which is 50. And then we can divide both sides by 10. We get x is equal to 50 divided by 10 is 5. And then we could go substitute back to solve for y. If x is 5, we could use the second equation right over here. We get y plus 2 times 5. I'll do it in that same color. 2 times 5 is equal to 13. Or y plus 10 is equal to 13. We can subtract 10 from both sides. And we will get y. These cancel out. y is equal to 3. So our solution that we get for x and y is that x is equal to 5. And y is equal to 3. And we can verify that it works in both equations. In this top equation-- let me do it in a new color-- negative 3 times 3 plus 4 times 5 is-- this is negative 9 plus 20, which is, indeed, equal to 11. So both of these satisfy the first equation. And then if we take the second equation, 3 plus 2 times 5, that's 3 plus 10, that does, indeed, equal 13. So it definitely satisfies both. And I want to be clear. You could have solved this with substitution. Or you could have changed which equation you scale so that we get different cancellations when we add or different eliminations. So another way that we could have done this, we could've kept the first equation the same. Negative 3y plus 4x is equal to 11. But maybe we want this 2x to cancel with this 4x. And the only way we could do that is if this 2x could become a negative 4x. And the way to get from a 2x to a negative 4x is to multiply it by negative 2. So let's multiply this entire equation by negative 2. So it would become negative 2y minus 4x is equal to negative 26. And if we then add the two equations, the x's will cancel out. You have negative 3y minus 2y, which is negative 5y is equal to 11 minus 26. That's negative 15. Now, you can divide both sides by negative 5. And you get-- the negatives cancel out-- y is equal to 3. So in this situation, we eliminated the x's first to solve for y. And then you could go back, substitute, and solve for x. You'll get x is equal to 5. The first time we did it, we eliminated the y's. We scaled this equation right here so that the y's would cancel out. And so we solved for the x first and then substituted back. Either way works. You get x is equal to 5. y is equal to 3.",math_8th-engage-ny_engage-8th-module-4
" Let's say we have the indefinite integral of the square root of 6x minus x squared minus 5. And obviously this is not some simple integral. I don't have just, you know, this expression and its derivative lying around, so u-substitution won't work. And so you can guess from just the title of this video that we're going to have to do something fancier. And we'll probably have to do some type of trig substitution. But this immediately doesn't look kind of amenable to trig substitution. I like to do trig substitution when I see kind of a 1 minus x squared under a radical sign, or maybe an x squared minus 1 under a radical sign, or maybe a x squared plus 1. These are the type of things that get my brain thinking in terms of trig substitution. but that doesn't quite look like that just yet. I have a radical sign. I have some x squared, but it doesn't look like this form. So let's if we can get it to be in this form. Let me delete these guys right there real fast. So let's see if we can maybe complete the square down here. So let's see. If this is equal to, let me rewrite this. And if this completing the square doesn't look familiar to you, I have a whole bunch of videos on that. Let me rewrite this as equal to minus 5 minus-- I need more space up here-- minus 5 minus x squared. Now there's a plus 6x, but I have a minus out here. So minus 6 x, right? A minus and a minus will becomes plus 6x. And then, I want to make this into a perfect square. So what number when I add it to itself will be minus 6? Well, it's minus 3 and minus 3 squared. So you take half of this number, you get minus 3, and you square it. Then you put a 9 there. Now, I can't just arbitrarily add nines. Or actually, I didn't add a 9 here. What did I do? I subtracted a 9. Because I threw a 9 there, but it's really a minus 9, because of this minus sign out there. So in order to make this neutral to my 9 that I just threw in there, this is a minus 9. I have to add a 9. So let me add a 9. So plus 9, right there. If this doesn't make complete sense, what I just did, and obviously you have the dx right there, multiply this out. You get minus x squared plus 6x, which are these two terms right there, minus 9, and then you'll have this plus 9, and these two will cancel out, and you'll just get exactly back to what we had before. Because I want you to realize, I didn't change the equation. This is a minus 9 because of this. So I added a 9, so I really added 0 to it. But what this does, it gets it into a form that I like. Obviously this, right here, just becomes a 4, and then this term right here becomes, what? That is x minus 3 squared. x minus 3 squared. So my indefinite integral now becomes the integral, I'm just doing a little bit of algebra, the integral of the square root of 4 minus x minus 3 squared dx. Now this is starting to look like a form that I like, but I like to have a 1 here. So let's factor a 4 out. So this is equal to, I'll switch colors, that's equal to the integral of the radical, and we'll have the 4, times 1 minus x minus 3 squared over 4. I just took a 4 out of both of these terms. If I multiply this out, I'll just get back to that, right there, dx. And now this is starting to look like a form that I like. Let me simplify it even more. So this is equal to the integral, if I take the 4 out, it becomes 2 times the square root of 1 minus, and I can rewrite this as x minus 3, let me write this way. 1 minus x minus 3 over 2 squared dx. And where did I get that 2 from? Well, if I just square both of these, I get x minus 3 squared over 2 squared. Which is x minus 3 over 4. So I have done no calculus so far. I just algebraically rewrote this indefinite integral as this indefinite integral. They are equivalent. But this, all of a sudden, looks like a form that I recognize. I showed you in the last video that cosine squared of theta is just equal to 1 minus sine squared of theta. You could actually do it the other way. You could do sine squared is equal to 1 minus cosine squared. No difference. But they both will work out. But this looks an awful lot like this. In fact, it would look exactly like this if I say that that is equal to sine squared of theta. So let me make that substitution. Let me write that x minus 3 over 2 squared is equal to sine squared of theta. Now, if we take the square root of both sides of that equation, I get x minus 3 over 2 is equal to sine of theta. Now we're eventually, you know where this is going to go. We're eventually going to have to substitute back for theta. So let's solve for theta in terms of x. So theta in terms of x, we could just say, just take the arc sine of both sides of this. You get theta is equal to, right, the arc sine of the sine is just theta. Theta is equal to the arc sine of x minus 3 over 2. Fair enough. Now, to actually do the substitution, though, we're going to have figure out what dx is, we're going to have to solve for x in terms of theta. So let me do that. So we get, if we multiply both sides of the equation by 2, we get x minus 3 is equal to 2 times the sine of theta, or that x is equal to 2 sine of theta plus 3. Now, if we take the derivative of both sides with respect to theta, we get dx d theta, is equal to 2 cosine of theta, derivative of this is just 0. Or we can multiply both sides by d theta, and we get dx is equal to 2 cosine of theta d theta. And we're ready to substitute back into our original indefinite integral. So this thing will now be rewritten as the integral of 2 times the radical, if I can get some space, of 1 minus, I'm replacing this with sine squared of theta. And all that times dx. Well, I just said that dx is equal to this, right here. So dx is equal to 2 cosine of theta d theta. What does this simplify to? This action right here, this is just cosine squared of theta. And we're going to take the square root of cosine squared of theta. So this, the square root of cosine squared of data, this whole term right here, right? That becomes the square root of cosine squared of theta, which is just the same thing as cosine of theta. So our integral becomes, so our integral is equal to, 2 times the square root of cosine squared of theta, so that's just 2 times cosine of theta, times 2 times cosine of theta. That's that one, right there. This is this, and all of this radical sine, that's this, right there. 1 minus sine squared was cosine squared, take the radical, you get cosine squared. And then everything times d theta. Now this is obviously equal to 4 times cosine squared of theta d theta. Which, by itself, is still not an easy integral to solve. I don't know, you know, I can't do U-substitution or anything like that, there. So what do we do? Well, we resort to our good old trig identities. Now, I don't know if you have this one memorized, although it tends to be in the inside cover of most calculus books, or inside cover of most trig books. But cosine squared of theta can be rewritten as 1/2 times 1 plus cosine of 2 theta. And I've proven this in multiple videos. So let's just make this substitution. Let me just replace this thing with that thing. So this integral becomes, it equals, 4 times cosine squared of theta, but cosine squared of theta is this. 4 times 1/2 times 1 plus cosine of 2 theta d theta. Now, this looks easier to deal with. So what is it? 4 times 1/2, that's 2. So my integral becomes the integral of 2 times 1, so it's 2, plus 2 times 2 cosine of 2 theta, all of that d theta. Now, this antiderivative is pretty straightforward. What is this, right here? This is the derivative with respect of theta of sine of 2 theta, right? This whole thing. What's the derivative sine of 2 theta? Take the derivative of the inside, that's 2, times the derivative of the outside, cosine of 2 theta. And this, of course, is the derivative of 2 theta. So this is equal to, the antiderivative of 2 with respect to theta, is just 2 theta, plus the antiderivative of this, which is just sine of 2 theta, and then we have a plus c. And of course, we can't forget that we defined theta, our original antiderivative was in terms of x. So we can't just leave it in terms of theta. 1We're going to have to do a back substitution. 1So let's just remember, theta was equal to arc 1sine of x minus 3 over 2. 1Let me write that on the side here. 1Now, if I immediately substitute this theta straight 1into this, I'm going to get a sine of 2 times arc sine of x 1minus 3 over 2, which would be correct. 1And I would have a 2 times arc sine of x minus 3 over 2. 1That would all be fine, and we would be done. 1But that's not satisfying. 1It's not a nice clean answer. 1So let's see if we can simplify this, so it's only in 1terms of sine of theta. 1So when you take the sine of the arc sine, then it just 1simplifies to x minus 3 over 2. 1Let me make that clear. 1So if I can write all of this in terms of sines of theta, 1because the sine of theta is equal to the sine of the arc 1sine of x minus 3 over 2. 1Which is just equal to x minus 3 over 2. 1So if I can write this in terms of sines of theta, then I can 1just make this substitution. 1Sine of theta equals that, and everything 1simplifies a good bit. 1So let's see if we can do that. 1Well, you may or may not know the other identity, and I've 1proven this as well, that sine of 2 theta, that's the same 1thing as sine of theta plus theta, which is equal to sine 1of theta cosine of theta plus, the thetas get swapped around, 1sine of theta plus cosine of theta, which is equal to, this 1is just the same thing written twice, 2 sine of theta 1cosine of theta. 1Some people have this memorized ahead of time, and if you have 1to take an exam on trig substitution, it doesn't hurt 1to have this memorized ahead of time. 1But let's rewrite this like this. 1So our indefinite integral in terms of theta, or our 1antiderivative, became 2 theta, plus, instead of sine of 2 1theta, we could write, 2 sine of theta cosine of theta, and 1of course we have a plus c. 1Now, I want to write everything in terms of sines of theta, but 1I have a cosine if theta there. 1So what can we do? 1Well, we know we know that cosine squared of theta is 1equal to 1 minus sine squared of theta, or that cosine of 1theta is equal to the square root of 1 minus sine 1squared of theta. 1Which seems like we're adding complexity to it, but the neat 1thing is, it's in terms of sine of theta. 1So let's do that. 1Let's make the substitution. 1So our antiderivative, this is the same thing as 2 data plus 2 1sine of theta times cosine of theta, which is equal to this, 1times the square root of 1 minus sine squared of theta, 1and all of that plus c. 1Now we're in the home stretch. 1This problem was probably harder than you thought 1it was going to be. 1We know that sine theta is equal to x minus 3 over 2. 1So let's make that reverse substitution. 1So we have 2 times theta. 1This first term is just 2 times theta, right there. 1So that's 2 times, we can't escape the arc sine. 1If we just have a theta, we have to say that theta is 1equal to arc sine of x minus 3 over 2. 1And then we have plus, let me switch colors, 1plus 2 sine of theta. 1Well, that's plus 2 times sine of theta is x minus 3 over 2. 1So 2 times x minus 3 over 2, and then all of that times 1the square root of 1 minus sine of theta squared. 1What's sine of theta? 1It's x minus 3 over 2 squared. 1And of course we have a plus c. 1Let's see if we can simplify this even more, now that 1we're at the home stretch. 1So this is equal to 2 arc sine of x minus 3 over 2, plus these 1two terms, this 2 and this 2 cancel out, plus x minus 3, 1times the square root of, what happens if we multiply 1everything here by, let's see, if we take a, so this is equal 1to 1 minus x minus 3 over 4. x minus 3 squared over 4. 1This simplification, I should write that in quotes, is taking 1me longer than I thought. 1But let's see if we can simplify this even more. 1If we multiply, let me just focus on this term right here, 1if we multiply the outside, or say, let's multiply 1and divide this by 2. 1So I'll write this as-- so let's just multiply 1this times 2 over 2. 1You might say, Sal, why are you doing that? 1Because I can rewrite this, let me write my whole thing here. 1So I have 2 arc sine of x minus 3 over 2, and then 1I have, I could take this denominator 2 right here. 1So I say, plus x minus 3 over 2. 1That 2 is that 2 right there. 1And then I could write this 2 right here as 1a square root of 4. 1Times the square root of 4, times the square 1root of all of this. 11 minus x minus 3 squared over 4. 1I think you see where I'm going. 1I'm kind of reversing everything that I did at the 1beginning of this problem. 1And maybe I'm getting a little fixated on making this as 1simple as possible, but I'm so close, so let me finish. 1So I get 2 times the arc sine of x minus 3 over 2, which I'm 1tired of writing, plus x minus 3 over 2, and if we bring this 14 in, right, the square root of 4 times the square root of that 1is equal to the square root of 4 times these things. 1So it's 4 minus x minus 3 squared, all of 1that that plus c. 1And we're at the home stretch. 1This is equal to 2 times the arc sine of x minus 3 over 2 1plus x minus 3 over 2 times the radical of 4 minus, let's 1expand this, x squared minus 6x plus 9. 1And then this expression right here simplifies to minus minus, 1it's 6x minus x squared, and then you have a 4 1minus 9 minus 5. 1Which is our original antiderivative. 1So finally, we're at the very end. 1We get the antiderivative is 2 arc sine of x minus 3 over 2 1plus x minus 3 over 2 times, time the radical of 6x 1minus x squared minus 5. 1That right there is the antiderivative of what this 1thing that we had at the very top of my little chalkboard, 1which is right there. 1So that is equal to the antiderivative of the 1square root of 6x minus x squared minus 5 dx. 1And I can imagine that you're probably as tired as I am. 1My hand actually hurts. 1But hopefully you find that to be vaguely satisfying. 1Sometimes I get complaints that I only do easy problems. 1Well, this was quite a hairy and not-so-easy problem.",math_old-integral-calculus_integration-techniques
" -  So let's say S is the value that this infinite series converges to. We're going to assume that this series actually converges. And the definition of the series, each term is going to be a function of N. We're going to assume that this is the same type of series that we looked at when we looked at the integral test, or namely that this function is a continuous positive decreasing function over the interval that we care about. So it is continuous, it is positive, and it is decreasing. This isn't saying continuous plus decreasing. Let me just write it that way. Continuous positive and it is decreasing. So it could be a function that looks something like this. Now, my goal of this video is to see if we can estimate a range around S. So this is going to be very useful, because we've seen some infinite series where we are able to figure out what exactly does it converge to. But you could imagine there are many, many more where we're not going to be able to figure out exactly what it converges to. And instead we're going to have to do it using a computer or by hand. And in those cases, it's good to know how good our estimate is. And we also want as good of an estimate as possible with as little computation as possible. So let's think about how we can do that. Well, the way to tackle it, you could imagine, is let's split this up, this infinite sum, let's split it up into the sum of a finite sum. So let's say the first k terms. So n equals one to k of f of n. So this is very computable. If k is low enough and if f a simple enough function, you could probably do this by hand. But you could definitely do this with a computer. And then it's going to be that plus an infinite. Plus another infinite series. But now you're going to pick up at k plus one, the k plus one term. And you're going to go to infinity of f of n. So if we could put some bounds on this, then that'll allow us to put some bounds on this right over here. Because this is just the sum of the partial sum of the partial sum of the first k terms and the remainder that we get after to get us to the actual value. So you could see kind of what's left over after we take that partial sum. And this is easier to write for me than this right over here. So they key is, can we come up with some bounds for this? And to do that I'm going to go to this graph and use some of the same arguments we used, or the same conceptual ideas we used, for the integration test. There's two ways to conceptualize what the sum represents relative to this graph. As we'll see, it can represent an over estimate of the area between sum, x value, and infinity. And it could represent the underestimate of a different region. So let's look at that. So let's first think about the underestimate. Let's think about the underestimate. So if this right over here, let's say that this right over here is k. Actually, let me do it in a color that's... Let me do it in that yellow color. So let's say that this right over here is k. This is k plus one. Let's do this is k plus two. K plus 2, k plus 3, on and on and on. So one way to conceptualize this sum right over here is it could be the sum of the following rectangles. So the first term is this area, the area of this first rectangle. Because this area's height, or this rectangle's height, is f of k plus one. And its width is one, so f of k plus one times one. Its area is just going to be f of k plus one, which is exactly this first term right over here, where n is k plus one. And then the second term, by that same argument, could represent the area of this rectangle. The third term could represent the area of the rectangle. And we could just keep going on and on and on. So what are the sums of these areas of these rectangles? What are the sums of these terms representing? Well, you could view it as an estimate. You could view it as an estimate of the area under the curve between x equals k and x equals infinity. But it's going to be an underestimate. Notice these are all completely contained in that area. So one way to think about it is that our R sub k is less than or equal to its underestimate for the area between x equals k and infinity of f of x dx. So that essentially puts an upper bound on us. And this is already interesting, because now we can already say if S -- so we know that S is equal to this. Now if this is less than this thing right over here, we can say that S is going to be less than or equal to our partial sum plus this thing. Plus the improper integral from k to infinity of f of x dx. Notice if this is equal to this and now since this is less than this, this must be less than what we have on the right hand side. So just like that, if we're able to compute these two things and we are often able to compute these two things, we're able to put an upper bound on our actual sum. Now what about placing a lower bound on it? Well, we could conceptualize the same sum, the same R sub k. Instead we can conceptualize it this way, where the first term here represents not this rectangle, but it represents this rectangle. Notice it has the same height, but it's just shifted over one to the right. The second term represents this rectangle. This third term represents this rectangle. Why does that make sense? Well, the area of this first rectangle, this is going to be its height, which is f of k plus one times its width, which is just one, so it's going to be f of k plus one. So the area here is the first term, the area here is the second term, area here is the third term, the area here is the fourth term. One way to think about it, we just shifted all of those yellow rectangles one to the right. But now this is approximating a different region. This is approximating the area under the curve not from k to infinity, but from k plus one to infinity. And instead of being an underestimate, it's an overestimate. Now the curve is contained within the rectangles. So we could say that R sub k in this context, when we conceptualize it this way, is going to be greater than or equal to the improper integral not from k, but from k plus one to infinity f of x dx. And what does that allow us to do? Well, this places a lower bound on this, which will also place a lower bound on this. If this is greater than that, then this is going to be greater than this replaced with the improper integral. So we can write that. So S is going to be greater than or equal to S sub k plus the improper integral from k plus one to infinity f of x dx. Now, you might be saying, ""Hey, Sal, this looks all ""crazy, you have all this abstract notation here, you've ""introduced an integral sign, this seems really daunting."" But as we'll see in the next few videos, these are actually sometimes fairly straightforward to compute. This can be very straightforward to compute if our k is not too large. If it's even large, a computer can do it. And then these we can actually often compute sometimes numerically, but even more frequently, and that kind of defeats the purpose, but we can also compute them using our analytic tools, using, I guess you could say, the power of calculus. And so what this allows us to do is put a pretty neat band around what our actual value that we converge to is. And as we'll see, the higher our k, the better an estimate we get and the tighter arrange of our confidence for that estimate. And another way to write these two inequalities is to write a compound inequality that S is going to be less than or equal to this business. So copy and paste. And S is going to be greater than or equal to this business. So we could say this business is going to be less than or equal to S. So let me just copy and paste that. So copy and paste. Oops, that's not what I wanted to do. So copy and paste. Then we could write it just like that. And so the next series of videos will actually apply this and we'll see that it's pretty straightforward. It looks a little daunting right now.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-series
" Let's see if we can tackle this spectrophotometry example. I took this from the Kotz, Treichel and Townsend Chemistry & Chemical Reactivity book and did it with their permission. So let's see what the problem is. It says a solution of potassium permanganate-- let me underline that in a darker color-- potassium permanganate has an absorbance of 0.539 when measured at 540 ometer in a 1 centimeter cell. So this 540 ometers is the wavelength of light that we're measuring the absorbance of. And so this is probably a special wavelength of light for potassium permanganate, one that it tends to be good at absorbing. So it'll be pretty sensitive to how much solute we have in the solution. OK, and the beaker is 1 centimeter. So that's just the length right there. What is the concentration of potassium permanganate? Prior to determining the absorbance for the unknown solution, the following calibration data were collected for the spectrophotometer. The absorbances of these known concentrations were already measured. So what we're going to do is we're going to plot these. And then, essentially, this absorbance is going to sit on the line. We learned from the Beer-Lambert law, that is a linear relationship between absorbance and concentration. So this absorbance is going to sit some place on this line. And we're just going to have to read off where that concentration is. And that will be our unknown concentration. So let's plot this first. Let's plot our concentrations first. So this axis, the horizontal axis, will be our concentration axis. I'll draw the axis in blue right there. Let me scroll down a little bit more. I just need to make sure I have all this data here. So this is concentration in molarity. And let's see, it goes from 0.03 all the way to 0.15. So let's make this 0.03, then go three more. This over here is 0.06. One, two, three, then this over here is 0.09. This over here is 0.12. And then this over here is 0.15. And then the absorbances go-- well it's close to 0, or close to 0.1-- all the way up to close to 1. So let's make this right here 0.1. Let's make this 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5-- almost done-- 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and then 0.9. And that, essentially, covers all of the values of absorbency that we have here. So let's plot the first one. When we had a concentration of potassium permanganate at 0.03 molar, our absorbance was 0.162. So 0.03, and then it goes to 0.16. This is 0.15, so 0.162 is going to be right over there. And then when we had 0.06 molarity of potassium permanganate our absorbance was 0.33. So 0.06, 0.33 which is right about-- this is 0.35, so 0.33 would be right about there. And we already see an interesting line form, but I'll plot all of these points. So at 0.09 molarity, we have 0.499. So almost 0.5 right over there. That's that value. And then at 0.12, we have 0.67 absorbance. So at 0.12, we have 0.67. So this is 0.12. This would be 0.65, so we have 0.67 absorbance right over there. And actually, what we're doing here, we're actually showing you that the Beer-Lambert law is true. At specific concentrations, we've measured the absorbance and you see that it's a linear relationship. Anyway, let's do this last one. At 0.15 molarity, we have absorbance of 0.84. So this right here is 0.15. I want to make sure I don't lose track of that line. And 0.84 is right over there. So you see the linear relationship? Let me draw the line. I don't have a line tool here, so I'm just going to try to freehand it. I'll draw a dotted line. Dotted lines are a little bit easier to adjust. I'm doing it in a slight green color, but I think you see this linear relationship. This is the Beer-Lambert law in effect. Now let's go back to our problem. We know that a solution, some mystery solution, has an absorbance of 0.539-- let me do our mystery solution in-- well, I've pretty much run out of colors. I'll do it in pink-- of 0.539. So our absorbance is 0.5-- this is 0.55, so 0.539 is going to be right over there. And we want to know the concentration of potassium permanganate. Well, if we just follow the Beer-Lambert law, it's got to sit on that line. So the concentration is going to be pretty darn close to this line right over here. And this over here looks like 0.10 molar. So this right here is 0, or at least just estimating it, looking at this, that looks like 0.10 molar, or 0.10 molarity for that solution. So that's the answer to our question just eyeballing it off of this chart. Let's try to get a little bit more exact. We know the Beer-Lambert law, and we can even figure out the constant. The Beer-Lambert law tells us that the absorbance is equal to some constant, times the length, times the concentration, where the length is measured in centimeters. So that is measured in centimeters. And the concentration is measured in moles per liter, or molarity. So we can figure out-- just based on one of these data points because we know that it's 0-- at 0 concentration the absorbance is going to be 0. So that's our other one. We can figure out what exactly this constant is right here. So we know all of these were measured at the same length, or at least that's what I'm assuming. They're all in a 1 centimeter cell. That's how far the light had to go through the solution. So in this example, our absorbance, our length, is equal to 1 centimeter. So let's see if we can figure out this constant right here for potassium permanganate at-- I guess this is probably standard temperature and pressure right here-- for this frequency of light. Which they told us up here it was 540 ometers. So if we just take this first data point-- might as well take the first one, we get-- the absorbance was 0.162. That's going to be equal to this constant of proportionality times 1 centimeter. That's how wide the vial was. Times-- now what is the concentration? Well when the absorbance was 0.162, our concentration was 0.03 times 0.-- actually, I'll write all the significant digits there-- 0.0300. So if we want to solve for this epsilon, we can just divide both sides of this equation by 0.0300. So you divide both sides by 0.0300 and what do we get? These cancel out, this is just a 1. And so you get epsilon is equal to-- let's figure out what this number in blue is here. And I'll take out my calculator. And I have 0.162 divided by 0.03 is equal to 5.4. And actually more significant is, we could really say it's 5.40 since we have at least three significant digits in both situations. So 5.40 is our proportionality constant. And you would actually divide by 1 in both cases. We just want the number here. But if you wanted the units, you'd want to divide by that 1 centimeters as well. Now we can use this to figure out the exact answer to our problem without having to eyeball it like we just did. We know that for potassium permanganate at 540 ometers, the absorbance is going to be equal to 5.4 1times-- and I'll put the units here. 1The units of this proportionality constant right 1here is liters per centimeter mole. 1And you'll see it'll just cancel out with the distance 1which is in centimeters, or the length, and the molarity 1which is in moles per liter. 1And it just gives us a dimension list, absorbance. 1So times-- in our example the length is 1 centimeter-- times 11 centimeter, times the concentration. 1Now in our example they told us the absorbance was 0.539. 1That's going to be equal to 5.4 liters per centimeter 1mole, times 1 centimeter, times our concentration. 1Well this centimeter cancels out with that centimeter right 1over there. 1And then we can just divide both sides by 15.4 liters per mole. 1So let's do that. 1Let's divide both sides by 5.4 liters per mole, 1and what do we have? 1So on the right-hand side, all of this business is going to 1cancel out. 1We're just going to have this concentration left over. 1So our concentration is equal to-- let's figure out what 1this number is. 1So we have 0.539 divided by 5.4 gives us-- so we only 1have-- well this is actually 5.40. 1So we actually have three significant digits. 1So we could say 0.0998. 1So this is 0.0998. 1And then if you're dividing by liters per mole, that's the 1same thing as moles per liter. 1So we're able to get a much more exact answer by actually 1just going through the math. 1But this is pretty darn close. 1This exact answer's pretty darn close to what we 1estimated just by eyeballing it off the chart. 10.1 is only a little bit more than 0.0998. 1Anyway, hopefully you enjoyed that.",science_ap-chemistry_kinetics-ap
" -  Olga was asked to find where f of x is equal to x minus two to the fourth power has inflection points. This is her solution. So we look at her solution and then they ask us, is Olga's work correct? If not, what's her mistake? So pause this video and see if you can figure this out. Alright, let's just follow her work. So here, she's trying to take the first derivative. So you would apply the chain rule. It would be four times x minus two to the third power times the derivative of x minus two which is just one. So this checks out. Then you take the derivative of this. It'd be three times four which would be 12 times x minus two to the second power times the derivative of x minus two which is just one which is exactly what she has here, 12 times x minus two to the second power. That checks out so step one's looking good for Olga. Step two, the solution of the second derivative equaling zero is x equals two. That looks right. The second derivative is 12 times x minus two squared and we wanna make that equal to zero. This is only going to be true when x is equal to two. So step two is looking good. So step three, Olga says f has an inflection point at x equals two. So she's basing this just on the fact that the second derivative is zero when x is equal to two. She's basing this just on the fact that f prime prime of two is equal to zero. Now, I have a problem with this because the fact that your second derivative is zero at x equals two, that makes two a nice candidate to check out but you can't immediately say that we have an inflection point there. Remember, an inflection point is where we go from being concave upwards to concave downwards or concave downwards to concave upwards and speaking in the language of the second derivative, it means that the second derivative changes signs as we go from below x equals two to above x equals two but we have to test that because it's not necessarily always the case. So let's actually test it. Let's think about some intervals. Intervals. So let's think about the interval when we go from negative infinity to two and let's think about the interval where we go from two to positive infinity. If you want, you could have some test values. You could think about the sign, sign of our second derivative and then based on that, you could think about concavity, concavity of f. So let's think about what's happening. So you could take a test value. Let's say one is in this interval and let's say three is in this interval and you could say one minus two squared is going to be, let's see, that's negative one squared which is one and then you're just going to, this is just going to be 12 so this is going to be positive and if you tried three, three minus two squared is one times 12. Well, that's also going to be positive and so you're going to be concave upwards. At least in these test values, it looks like on either side of two that the sign of the second derivative is positive on either side of the two and you might say, well, maybe I just need to find closer values but if you inspect the second derivative here, you can see that this is never going to be negative. In fact, for any value other than x equals two and this value right over here since we're, even if x minus two is negative, you're squaring it which will make this entire thing positive and then multiplying it times a positive value. So for any value other than x equals two, the sign of our second derivative is positive which means that we're going to be concave upwards and so we actually don't have an inflection point at x equals two because we are not switching signs as we go from values less than x equals two to values greater than x equals two. Our second derivative is not switching sides. So once again, this is incorrect. We actually don't have an inflection point at x equals two because our second derivative does not switch signs as we cross x equals two which means our concavity does not change.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-derivatives-analyze-functions
" - [Lecturer] Hooke's Law tells you how to find the force exerted by an ideal or linear spring. And it's a simple law. It tells you the amount of force that spring is gonna exert will be proportional to the amount that spring has been stretched or compressed from its equilibrium or natural length. Which, in equation form just says that the magnitude of the spring force, is gonna equal the spring constant multiplied by the amount the spring has been stretched or compressed. Note this x is not the length of the spring. The x is how much that spring has been stretched from or compressed from the equilibrium position or the unstretched position. So what's an example problem involving Hooke's law look like? Let's say an ideal spring is hanging from the ceiling at rest, and it has an unstretched length L1. And then you hang a mass M from the spring at rest and it stretches the spring to a length L2. What is an expression for the spring constant of the spring? So the force of gravity has to be balanced by the spring force. That means the magnitude of the spring force is equal to the magnitude of the force of gravity. The spring force is always K times X. What is X gonna represent? It's not gonna be L1 or L2. X is how much the spring has been stretched from its equilibrium position which would be L2 minus L1. And if we solve for K we get mg over L2 minus L1. What's a simple harmonic oscillator? A simple harmonic oscillator's any variable who's change can be described by a sine or cosine function. What does that function look like? It looks like this. So the variable that's changing is a function of time, which could be the vertical position of a mass on a spring. The angle of a pendulum or any other simple harmonic oscillator is gonna be equal to the amplitude of the motion, which is the maximum displacement from equilibrium, times either sine or cosine of two pie times the frequency of the motion times the variable t. Which, since frequency is one over the period, you could write as two pie over the period times the time variable t. How do you know whether you use sine or cosine? Well sine starts at zero and goes up. And cosine starts at a maximum and goes down. So if you know the behavior of your oscillator at t equals zero. You can decide whether to use cosine or sine. Something that's important to know is how to find the period of an oscillator. The period of a mass on a spring is gonna be two pie times the square root, the mass connected to the spring divided by the spring constant k. Note that this does not depend on the amplitude. If you stretch that mass farther, it'll go faster and it has farther to go which cancels out and the period remains the same. And the formula for the period of a pendulum, which is a mass swinging on a string, is gonna be two pie times the square root the length of the string, divided by the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity. Which also does not depend on the amplitude, as long as the angles are small. And it doesn't depend on the mass either. How do you find this period on a graph? Well if you're given the graph of the motion of a simple harmonic oscillator as a function of time, the interval between peaks is gonna represent the period. Or the time is takes for this oscillator to reset. So what's an example problem involving simple harmonic motion look like? Let's say in a lab a mass M on Earth can either be hung on a string of length L and allowed to swing back and forward with a period T pendulum, or hung on a spring of spring constant k and allowed to oscillate up and down with a period T spring. If a 2M mass were used instead of the 1M mass, what would happen to the period of the two motions? Well the period of a pendulum doesn't depend on the mass. And so the period of the pendulum would not change. The answer would have to be D. What are waves? Waves are disturbances that travel through a medium and transfer energy in momentum over significant distances without transmitting any mass itself over those distances. What does medium mean? This is a fancy word for the material through which the wave can travel. So you can classify a wave by the medium it's in. But you could also classify waves by the type of disturbance you've created. For transverse waves, the disturbance of the medium is perpendicular to the wave velocity. By wave velocity, we mean the direction in which the disturbance travels. And by oscillation of the medium, we mean the direction in which the particles of the medium actually move. For a wave on a string, the particles move up and down but the disturbance travels to the right. So this would be a transverse wave. For longitudinal waves, the oscillation or disturbance of the medium is parallel to the wave velocity. The classic longitudinal wave is sound. If a sound wave were traveling rightward through the air, it would look like a compressed region, and the air itself would move back and forth, right and left, parallel to the direction the wave disturbance is traveling. Which makes sound waves longitudinal. For every type of wave, the speed of that wave disturbance is gonna be equal to the wavelength of the wave divided by the period. In other words, if you watched a wave crest, that wave crest would move one wavelength every period. And since the speed is distance per time, the speed of the wave crest would be one wavelength per period. You could find the wavelength on a graph of y versus x by finding the distance between crests. And if you're wondering why this doesn't represent the period? It's because this is a graph of the wave versus x, versus the horizontal position, not the time. You could make a graph of y versus the time. And what that would represent is the motion of a single point on the wave for all moments in time. And for this graph versus time, the interval between peaks is the period. So if you get a graph of a wave, you've gotta check whether it's versus x or versus t. If it's versus x, peak to peak is the wavelength. And if it's versus t, peak to peak is the period. And since one over the period is equal to the frequency, we can rewrite this speed formula as the speed of a wave equals the wavelength of a wave times the frequency. And the way it's given on the formula sheet on the AP exam is that the wavelength of a wave is equal to the speed of the wave divided by the frequency. Now this formula confuses a lot of people though, because they think if you increase the frequency, that'll increase the speed of the wave. But that's not true. Increasing the frequency will cause the wavelength to decrease and the speed of the wave will remain constant. The only way to change the speed of a wave is to change the properties of the medium itself. In other words the only way to change the speed of the waves on water would be to change something about the water itself, its density, its salinity, the temperature of that water. Changing frequency isn't gonna change the speed of the wave. And neither will changing the amplitude. The only thing that changes the speed of the wave is changes to the medium itself. And so what's an example problem involving waves look like? Let's say a sound lab is being conducted in a lab room with total cubic volume V and temperature T. A speaker in the room is hooked up to a function generator and it plays a note with frequency f and amplitude A. Which of the following would change the speed of the sound waves? Increasing the frequency would just make that sound a higher note. But it wouldn't change the speed of the sound wave. Increasing the temperature of the room is a change to the medium itself so this would change the speed of sound. Decreasing the amplitude's just gonna make the sound seem softer and not appear as loud. And decreasing the total volume of the space in the lab room doesn't actually effect the medium, it just gives you less of the medium. So the best answer here would be B. The doppler effect refers to the change in the perceived frequency when a speaker or a wave source, moves relative to the observer. If a wave source and observer are moving toward each other, the wavelength of the sound wave is gonna decrease according to that observer. Which would make the perceived frequency increase. This happens since if the source is heading toward you, as that speaker emits wave pulses, the speaker moves toward the wave pulse it just emitted and on this leading edge the crests of the wave will be closer together. Since they're closer together, the wavelength is smaller. And the rate at which these crests are gonna hit the observer is gonna be higher. So this observer's gonna hear a higher frequency than is actually being played by the wave source when it is at rest. And for the observer on the trailing edge, since the wave source is moving away from the pulses it just sent in this direction, these wave crests are gonna be spaced further apart, which increases the wavelength and decreases the rate at which these crests are gonna hit the observer. So this observer's gonna hear a frequency that's less than the actual frequency being played by the source when it's at rest. So what's an example problem involving the Doppler effect look like? Let's say the driver of a car sees that they're heading straight toward a person standing still in the crosswalk. So the driver continuously honks their horn and emits a sound of frequency f horn. This is the frequency the horn plays when the car would be at rest. And the driver of the car also simultaneously slams on the brakes and skids to a stop right in front of the person standing in the crosswalk. What would that person in the crosswalk hear as the car's skidding to a stop? Well since that car is heading toward the person, those wave crests are gonna be spaced closer together, so this person will hear a smaller wavelength and a higher frequency. But as the car slows down, this effect becomes less and less dramatic. And once the car stops, the wave crests will be spaced out their normal spacing, and the person will just hear the regular horn frequency of the car. So first this person's gonna hear a higher frequency, but that will eventually just become the actual frequency of the horn once the car stops and there's no more relative motion between the person and the car. When two waves overlap in the same medium, we call it wave interference, or wave superposition. While those waves are overlapping, they'll combine to form a wave shape that will be the sum of the two waves. In other words, while the two waves are overlapping, to find the value of the total wave, you just add up the values of the individual waves. So if you overlap two waves that look identical, they would combine to form a wave that's twice as big. And we call this constructive interference. And if you overlap two waves that are 180 degrees out of phase, they'll combine to form no wave at all. We call this destructive interference. 1So even though while the waves are overlapping, 1you add up their individual values to get the total wave. 1After these waves are done overlapping, 1they'll pass right through each other. 1So if I sent a wave pulse down 1a string at another wave pulse, 1when these two pulses overlap, 1the string would be flat but shortly after that, 1the wave pulses would continue on their way unaffected. 1They don't bounce off of each other, 1or cause permanent damage. 1It's only while they're overlapping 1that you'll get the wave interference. 1So what's an example problem involving wave 1interference look like? 1Let's say two wave pulses on a string 1head toward each other as seen in this diagram to the right 1and we wanna know what would be the shape of the wave 1when the wave pulses overlap? 1So to find the total wave we'll add up the values 1of each individual wave. 1The blue wave's gonna move to to the right, 1and the red wave's gonna move to the left. 1And we'll add up the individual values. 1Zero of the red wave plus negative two units 1of the blue wave will add up to negative two units 1for the total wave. 1And then positive two units of the red wave 1plus negative two units of the blue wave 1is gonna equal zero units for the total wave. 1Again positive two units of the red wave 1plus negative two units of the blue wave 1add up to zero units for the total wave. 1And then zero units for the red wave 1plus negative two units for the blue wave 1is gonna equal negative two units for the total wave. 1So our total wave will look like this. 1Since this pyramid just took a bite out of this 1blue rectangular wave. 1How do you deal with standing waves on strings? 1Well to get a standing wave at all, 1you need waves overlapping 1that are going in opposite directions. 1But even if you have that, you're not necessarily 1gonna get a standing wave. 1Only certain allowed wavelengths will create 1a standing wave in that medium. 1And what determines the allowed wave lengths 1is the length of the medium and the boundaries 1of that medium. 1In other words the ends of a string could be fixed 1or loose, if the end of the string is fixed, 1it's gonna be a displacement node. 1Node is the word we use to refer to points 1that have no displacement. 1And if the end of a string is loose, 1that end would act as a displacement anti node. 1Anti node being a point that has maximum displacement. 1What would these standing waves look like? 1Standing waves no longer appear to move along the medium, 1they just oscillate back and forth in place. 1So this anti node would move from the top to the bottom 1back to the top. 1But you wouldn't see this crest move right or left, 1hence the name standing wave. 1However the nodes stay put. 1There's never any displacement at a node. 1Once you've determined the boundary conditions 1and the length of that medium, 1the possible wavelengths are set. 1Because the only allowed standing waves 1have to start at a node and end at a node. 1The fundamental standing wave refers to the largest 1possible wavelength standing wave. 1And in this case it would be one half of a wavelength. 1So the length of the medium would have to equal one half 1of the wavelength of the wave. 1Similarly for the second harmonic, 1we still have to start and end at a node, 1so the next possibility would be an entire wavelength 1which means the length of the medium would equal one 1wavelength of the wave. 1And if you get to the third harmonic, 1this is three halves of a wavelength. 1And there's no limit, you can keep going here. 1To excite these higher standing waves, 1you gotta keep increasing the frequency, 1because you'll keep decreasing the wavelength 1of the distance between peaks. 1So what would a standing wave look like 1if one of the ends were loose? 1In that case that end would be an anti node, 1and the fundamental standing wave would only take the shape 1of a fourth of a wavelength. 1Since it has to go from a node to an anti node. 1That means the length of the string would have to equal 1one fourth of a wavelength. 1The next possible standing wave would be 1three fourths of a wavelength. 1And the next possibility would be five fourths 1of a wavelength. 1And again this progression keeps on going. 1So what's an example problem involving standing waves 1on strings look like? 1Let's say one end of a string of length L 1is attached to the wall and the other end is fixed 1to a vibrating rod. 1A student finds that the string sets up a standing wave 1as seen here when the frequency 1of the rod is set to f nought. 1What are the speed of the waves on the string? 1Well we know the string length is L. 1And we can figure out how much of a wavelength this is. 1From here to here would be one wavelength. 1And there's another half. 1So the string length L is equalling three halves 1of a wavelength or in other words the wavelength here 1is 2L over three. 1And we know the speed of the wave is always 1wavelength times frequency. 1So the speed of the wave here is gonna be 2L over three, 1which is the wavelength of the wave, 1times the frequency and so the best answer is D. 1How do you deal with standing waves in tubes? 1So just like standing waves in strings, 1the wavelength of the standing waves in a tube 1are determined by the length of the tube, 1and the boundary conditions of that tube. 1But this time instead of the sting shaking, 1you're creating a standing wave out of sound waves. 1Now for the boundary conditions of this tube, 1an open end is gonna act like a displacement anti node. 1Since the air at an open end can oscillate wildly. 1And you get maximum air disturbance. 1But a closed end of a tube is gonna act like 1a displacement node since there'll be no air disturbance 1at a closed end. 1So what if both ends of the tube were open 1giving us anti node anti node standing waves? 1Well the first possibility of the largest wavelength 1standing wave would go from anti node to anti node. 1And this is one half of a wavelength. 1So the length of this tube would have to equal 1half of a wavelength. 1The next possibility would still go from anti node 1to anti node. 1And this is equal to one whole wavelength. 1It might not look like is but from valley to valley, 1is a whole wavelength. 1So the length of this tube would equal one wavelength. 1And the next possibility would equal three halves 1of a wavelength. 1And you should note this is the same progression 1that we had for node node strings. 1So whether both ends are anti nodes, 1or both ends are nodes, 1if both boundary conditions are the same, 1you get this same progression that goes 1half of a wavelength, one whole wavelength, 1three halves of a wavelength. 1Basically any integer or half integer wavelength. 1And what if we closed one of the ends of this tube? 1If we closed one end of the tube, 1that end would become a displacement node, 1since the air can't move at that position. 1Which would make it a node and it would have to go 1to the open end which is an anti node. 1So the largest possibility this time would 1be one fourth of a wavelength. 1The next possibility would still go from node to anti node 1and this would be three fourths of a wavelength. 1And if you notice, this is exactly the same 1as when we had node anti node strings. 1We had the same progression of lambda over four, 1three lamba over four, five lambda over four, 1any odd integer lambda over four, 1were the allowed standing wavelengths. 1So if one end has a different boundary condition 1from the other end this is gonna be the progression 1of allowed lengths of the medium. 1So what would an example problem involving standing waves 1in tubes look like? 1Let's say you blow over the top of a tube that's open 1at both ends and it resonates with a frequency f nought. 1If the bottom of the tube is then covered 1and air is again blown over the top of the tube, 1what frequency would be heard relative to the frequency 1heard when both ends were open? 1Well when both ends are open, 1we know the standing wave's gonna be an anti node 1to anti node. 1Which is one half of a wavelength. 1Which would equal the length of that tube. 1So the wavelength would be two times the length 1of the tube. 1But when we close one of the ends, 1we turn that end from an anti node into a node. 1So we'd have to go from an anti node to a node. 1Which is only one fourth of a wavelength. 1So one fourth of a wavelength would equal 1the length of the tube. 1And that means lambda equals 4L, this wavelength doubled. 1So what would that do to the frequency? 1Well we know V equals lambda f, 1and we didn't change the medium here 1so the speed is gonna remain the same. 1So if we double the wavelength, 1we'd have to cut the frequency in half 1in order to maintain the same speed of the wave. 1So when we close the bottom of this tube, 1we'd hear half the frequency we heard 1when both ends were open. 1Beat frequency refers to the phenomenon 1where two waves overlap with different frequencies. 1When this occurs, the interference of the waves 1at a point in space turns from constructive, 1to destructive back to constructive and so on. 1Which if this were a sound wave, 1you'd perceive as a wobble in the loudness of the sound. 1And the reason this happens is that if these waves 1started in phase and they were constructive, 1since they have different frequencies, 1one wave would start to become out of phase with the other. 1Eventually becoming destructive, which would be soft. 1But if you wait longer, one of these peaks 1catches up to the next peak in the progression, 1and the waves again become constructive 1which would be loud again. 1And the times this takes to go from loud to soft 1to loud again is called the beat period. 1But more often you'll hear about the beat frequency. 1Which is just one over the beat period. 1So the beat period is the time it takes to go from 1loud to soft back to loud. 1And the beat frequency is the number 1of times it does that per second. 1How do you determine the beat frequency or the beat period? 1Well the formula used to find the beat frequency 1is actually really simple. 1You just take the difference of the frequencies 1of the two waves that are overlapping. 1If there is no difference, 1if these waves have the same frequency, 1you'd have a beat frequency of zero 1which would mean you hear no wobbles at all. 1The further apart these two frequencies get, 1the more wobbles you would hear per second. 1And then to find the beat period, 1you could take one over the beat frequency. 1So what would an example problem 1involving beat frequency look like? 1Let's say these two waves were overlapping 1and we want to determine the beat frequency. 1The period of the first wave is four seconds. 1That means the frequency of the first wave is one over four, 1or 0.25 hertz. 1And the period of the second wave is two seconds, 1which means that the frequency is one over two or 0.5 hertz. 1To get the beat frequency you subtract one frequency 1from the other. 10.5 minus 0.25 would be 0.25 hertz.",science_physics_review-for-ap-physics-1-exam
" -  The function m is given in three equivalent forms. Which form most quickly reveals the y-intercept? So let's just remind ourselves. If I have a function, the graph y is equal to m of x. And these are all equivalent forms, they tell us that. The function m is given in three equivalent forms. I should be able to algebraically manipulate anyone of these to get any of the other ones. And so, if I wanted to graph y is equal to m of x, and let's say it looks something like this. I actually know it's a downward opening parabola, because I can look at this form right over here and say, ""Hey look, the coefficient ""on the second degree term here is a negative."" So it's going to be a downward opening parabola. That's a messy drawing of it. And so if we're talking about the y intercept, we're saying, ""Hey where does it intersect the y-axis?"" So what is the y value when x is equal to zero? So it boils down to how quickly can we evaluate m of zero? What is m of x, when x is equal to zero? So how quickly can you evaluate m of zero? Well in this top one, I can substitute zero for x and so it'll be negative two times negative three times negative nine. So it's not too hard to figure out, but there's going to be some calculation in my head. Similarly in the second choice, for x equals zero, I then get negative six-squared, which is positive 36 times negative two, which is negative 72, and then I have to add that to positive 18. I can do that, but it's a little bit of computation. But here for this last one, and this is known as standard form, if I say x equals zero that term disappears, that term disappears and I'm just left with m of zero is equal to negative 54. So standard form, this is standard form right over here, was by far the easiest. So we know the y-intercept is zero comma negative 54. Now one rule of caution. Sometimes you might look at what is called, vertex form. And as we'll see this is the easiest one where it is to identify the vertex. But when you see this little plus 18 hanging out, it looks a lot like this negative 54 that was hanging out. And you say, ""Hey, when x equals zero, ""maybe I can just cross that out ""the same way that I cross these terms out."" And be very, very careful there, because if x equals zero, this whole thing does not equal zero. When x is equal to zero, as I just said, you have negative six-squared, which is 36 times negative two. This is equal to negative 72. So m of zero is definitely not 18. So be very, very careful. But we can see that the best choice is this one, standard form, not vertex form or factored form. Factored form, as you can imagine, is very good for figuring out the zeros. Let's do another example. And actually this is the same m of x, but we're going to ask something else. So it's given in those same three forms. Which form most quickly reveals the vertex? Well I just called this vertex form before, but what's valuable about the vertex form is you can really say, ""Okay, this is going to be, ""this is going to achieve its vertex ""when this thing over here is equal to zero."" How do I know that? Well, once you get used to vertex form, it'll just become a bit of second nature. But if this is a downward-opening parabola, the vertex is when you hit that maximum point. And as you can see here, x minus six-squared is always going to be non-negative. You multiply that times the negative two, it's always going to be non-positive. It's either going to be zero or a negative value, so this is always going to take away from this 18. And so if you want to find the vertex, the maximum point here, it would be the x value that makes this thing equal to zero. Because for any other x value, this thing is going to be negative, it's going to take away from that 18. And so you can see by inspection, well what x value will make this equal to zero? Well if x is equal to six, six minus six is equal to zero, zero-squared is zero, times negative two is zero. And so m of six is equal to 18. So this lets us know very quickly that the vertex is going to happen at x is equal to six and then the y value there or the m of six is going to be equal to 18. You can do it with these other ones. The hardest one would be standard form. Standard form you could complete the square or do some other techniques or you could try to get into factored form. Factored form you can find the zeros and then you'd know that the x-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the x-coordinate of our two x-intercepts and then you could figure out the y value there. But this one is definitely the easiest. The vertex form and what is the vertex? Well it's going to happen at the point six comma 18. Let's do one last example. So this is a different function. The function f is given in three equivalent forms, which form most quickly reveals the zeros or roots of the function? So once again, when we're talking about zeros or roots, if we have, let's say that's the x axis and if you have a parabola that looks like that, the roots are, or the zeros are the x values that make that function equal to zero. Or they're the x values of the x-intercepts, you could say. And so what x values make or which one is easy to figure out when this function is equal to zero? Which of these forms, because they're all equivalent. You can expand out these first two and you should get this last one in standard form. Which one is easy to identify the zeros? Well in factored form, I could just say, ""Well, what makes either this thing zero ""or that thing zero?"" Because an x that makes this first one zero or the second one zero is going to make this whole expression zero. So you can quickly say, ""Well if x is equal to negative one, ""this is going to be zero. ""Or if x is equal to negative 11, ""this is going to be zero."" So this is a very fast way to find out the zeros. This one here, a lot harder. You would have to solve three times x plus six-squared minus 75 is equal to zero. Do some algebraic manipulation and you would eventually get to these answers. So I would rule the vertex form right over here. And this form, standard form, the first step I would do, is try to get it into factored form. And then from factored form, I would find the zeros. So once again, this is definitely more work than if you already have it in factored form. So factored form is definitely what you want when you're trying to find the zeros. And here it says write one of the zeros, I could write x equals negative one or I could have written x equals negative 11.",math_math2_quad-2
" Whenever I talk about flu vaccine with people, I often hear the same questions and comments coming up over and over again. And so I put a short list together of really common things that people say. And I wanted to discuss them one by one. So let's say this person over here to the top left, this person, she says to me, well, you know what? I don't really see the point of getting the vaccine because I never get sick. She says many years have gone by, and her immune system has just been really healthy, and she just never seems to get sick. So she just doesn't see the point of getting the vaccine. And in response to this, what I usually draw an analogy to is seat belts. And I'll say, well, many people have never been in a serious car accident, but we know from research that seat belts are a really good idea, and they keep you safe. And they reduce the risk of getting a horrible injury. And so just as I would recommend you wear the seat belt, or maybe you wear a helmet if you're doing something dangerous, similarly, I would recommend the flu vaccine. And usually when I explain it this way, people get it. And they say, oh, OK, well even though I've never gotten in a major car accident, I do wear my seat belt. So just like that, even though I've never gotten sick, I'm going to go ahead and get my flu vaccine. Now, on the bottom left, this gentleman is saying a little bit of the opposite. He says, well, you know, I've gotten the flu vaccine, Dr. Desai. But I still got sick. I did it last year, maybe the year before, and I still got sick afterwards. So what was the point? Why did I even do it? And so now I don't want to do it anymore. And I can understand his logic. That makes a degree of sense. And what I usually tell folks that say this is-- I explain the idea of a copycat virus, that maybe when they got sick with what they thought was the flu or the flu virus, that maybe it was one of these other viruses. Remember there are viruses such as RSV, or rhinovirus, that can sometimes make you feel like you have the flu. So maybe he had one of those viruses instead. Another explanation could be maybe he got sick right after he got the vaccine. And remember, the vaccine needs a couple of weeks. There's a two-week delay or so before you get the full protection from the vaccine. So maybe he was in that two-week time span right after he got the vaccination, and maybe he got sick then. And lastly, we have to remember the flu vaccine has three strains in it. So maybe he had a different strain. Maybe it was just one or the other flu virus strains that was out there that year. So who knows exactly why he got sick that year that he says he got sick. But that doesn't change the fact that the flu vaccine is still going to reduce his chances of getting sick in the future. Now, one thing, I'm going to stick with this gentleman here in the bottom left. He might say, well, a different strain? What the heck? If that's the case, then what's the point? I often hear that. He says, what's the point if you could have a flu illness from some other strain? And when people talk about this, I have to remind them that it's not perfect. So it's not an exact science. And what you have to remember is that it goes back to the seat belt issue. It does reduce your chances of getting sick from the flu, but it's not going to reduce it down to zero. Nothing in life is going to reduce your chances to zero, and there's still a possibility that you could get sick. And so our best offer is that you can reduce the chance of getting sick. Let's move on to this gentleman in the middle then. And so he says to me, well, you know what? I think that the flu vaccine made me sick. So this is a little different. He's saying that the flu vaccine itself made him sick. And this is something a lot of people think. They think, well, maybe I was fine, and maybe it was only after getting the flu vaccine that I got sick. And this can be a very frustrating thing to feel. I mean, that's horrible that you were feeling fine, and then a vaccine came along and made you feel awful. But a couple of facts have to come to mind. So one fact, for example, is that we know that the flu vaccine cannot give you flu. So we know flu vaccine does not cause flu. That's a fact. And the reason I can say that with certainty is that one of the two vaccines is actually dead. Remember, there's the TIV and then there's the LAIV. The TIV is a dead vaccine, meaning the virus inside of it is dead. And the LAIV-- that's the other option-- this one is alive, but it's very weak. And so usually with this one you might get a runny nose at best. And so, if he says, I think that I got sick from the flu vaccine, I would say, well, I don't think that's possible from this one, right? If you got the injected version, then that's not possible at all. And if you got the live version, then you may have gotten some symptoms, but we wouldn't call that the flu. And I would also say that if that weak vaccine made you sick, can you only imagine how you would have felt if you had the wild virus, the one that circulates and we're trying to protect you from? What's much more likely for this gentleman is that he probably got sick from maybe this copycat virus, one of the other viruses that are circulating, probably around the time that he had the flu vaccine. So he mistakenly thought that the vaccine made him sick when it was probably just another virus. Or maybe he got sick when he was still within two weeks of getting the vaccine. Because, again, we said before that it takes a couple weeks to really get up and running. So in the top right, now we have this guy and he says to me, well, you know what? I hate pain. And this is probably my excuse. This is the one I used to use a lot. I hate pain. And I hate getting vaccines because usually that means a lot of pain. So for folks like this, and again, this was my own mindset, I say, OK, well, if pain is what you're trying to avoid, think about the fact that flu, getting sick with the flu, is much, much worse than getting a sore arm. And that's the most common side effect people talk about with that TIV vaccine, the dead vaccine. And also, if you get the other vaccine, the live vaccine, then I would say, well, flu is still a lot worse than getting a runny nose. And that's the most common side effect that people talk about with the live vaccine. So when you think about the common side effects, flu is much, much worse than the side effects you get with the vaccines. So we come down to this lady in the bottom right. She says to me, well, you know what, Dr. Desai? I think you're a nice person, but I really don't trust vaccines. I don't think that they're safe, and I don't trust what's inside of them. I think that there is something dangerous about them. And specifically, I don't like, she might even say, thimerosal. Thimerosal is something that people talk a lot about. And it's found inside of some of the flu vaccines. And so that's what she's referring to. So, in response, it's tough. It's tough to talk about issues if you're not trusted. And so the first and easy thing to say is, well, if you really just don't trust thimerosal, some of the flu vaccines, the single-dose kind of vials of flu vaccines, they don't even have thimerosal. So single-dose vials don't have thimerosal. So that's kind of an easy solution, right? If that's her biggest issue or concern, then you can just say, well, fair enough. That's an easy fix. And sometimes that works. Sometimes that's good enough and people say oh, OK, well, if they don't have it, then I'll go ahead and get the single-dose flu vaccine. But for others that simply just don't trust vaccines in general, because they've heard about thimerosal, or they've heard about autism, things like that, there I think it's really helpful to just discuss where these things come from. Where did this whole idea of thimerosal or autism-- where was it born? And the truth is that there's a complicated history to that. And there's a huge thimerosal myth that has been born and people discuss on the internet. And so I'll talk about thimerosal myth and the facts behind it because that's the only way to garner a little bit of trust with folks, is to actually discuss the facts. And actually separately from this video, we have a thimerosal video that you can watch and understand as well.",science_health-and-medicine_infectious-diseases
" -  Imagine that in an effort to make bowling more exciting, bowling alleys put a big loop-the-loop in the middle of the lane, so you had to bowl the ball really fast to get the ball up and around the loop and then only afterward, it would go hit the bowling pins kinda like mini golf bowling or something like that. Well if you were gonna build this, you'd have to know at the top of the loop, this structure's gonna have to withstand a certain minimum amount of force. You might wanna know how strong do you have to make this. You can't have this thing breaking because it can't withstand the force of the bowling ball. So let's ask ourselves that question. How much force is this loop structure gonna have to be able to exert while this bowling ball is going around in a circle and let's pick this point at the top to analyze. We'll put some numbers in here. Let's say the ball was going eight meters per second at the top of the loop. That's pretty darn fast so someone really hurled this thing through here. Now let's say the loop has a radius of two meters and the bowling ball has a mass of four kilograms, which is around eight or nine pounds. Now that we have these numbers, we can ask the question: How much normal force is there gonna be between the loop and the ball? So in other words, what is the size of that normal force, the force between the two surfaces? This is what we'd have to know in order to figure out if our structure is strong enough to contain this bowling ball as it goes around in a circle. And it's also a classic centripetal force problem, so let's do this. What do we do first? We should always draw a force diagram. If we're looking for a force, you draw a force diagram. So what are the forces on this ball? You're gonna have a force of gravity downward, and the magnitude of the force of gravity is always given by M times G, where G represents the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity. And we're gonna have a normal force as well. Now which way does this normal force point? A common misconception, people wanna say that that normal force points up because in a lot of other situations, the normal force points up. If you're just standing on the ground over here, the normal force on you is upward because it keeps you from falling through the ground, but that's not what this loop structure's doing up here. The loop structure isn't keeping you up. The loop structure's keeping you from flying out of the loop and that means this normal force is gonna have to point downward. So this is weird for a lot of people to think about, but because the surface is above this ball, the surface pushes down. Surfaces can only push. If the surface is below you, the surface has to push up. If the surface was to the side of you, the surface would have to push right. And if the surface was to the right of you, the surface would have to push left. Normal forces in other words, always push. So the force on the ball from the track is gonna be downward but vice versa. The force on the track from the ball is gonna be upward. So if this ball were going a little too fast and this were made out of wood, you might see this thing splinter because there's too much force pushing on the track this way. But if we're analyzing the ball, the force on the ball from the track is downward. And after you draw a force diagram, the next step is usually, if you wanna find a force, to use Newton's Second Law. And to keep the calculation simple, we typically use Newton's Second Law for a single dimension at at time, i.e. vertical, horizontal, centripetal. And that's what we're gonna use in this case because the normal force is pointing toward the center of the circular path and the normal force is the force we wanna find, we're gonna use Newton's Second Law for the centripetal direction and remember centripetal is just a fancy word for pointing toward the center of the circle. So, let's do it. Let's write down that the centripetal acceleration should equal the net centripetal force divided by the mass that's going in the circle. So if we choose this, we know that the centripetal acceleration can always be re-written as the speed squared divided by the radius of the circular path that the object is taking, and this should equal the net centripetal force divided by the mass of the object that's going in the circle and you gotta remember how we deal with signs here because we put a positive sign over here because we have a positive sign for our centripetal acceleration and our centripetal acceleration points toward the center of the circle always. Then in toward the center of the circle is going to be our positive direction, and that means for these forces, we're gonna plug in forces toward the center of the circle as positive. So let's do that. This is the part where most of the problem is happening. You gotta be careful here. I'm just gonna plug in. What are the centripetal forces? To figure that out, we just look at our force diagram. What forces do we have in our diagram. We've got the normal force and the force of gravity. Let's start with gravity. Is the gravitational force going to be a centripetal force. First of all, that's the question you have to ask. Does it even get included in here at all? And to figure that out you ask: Does it point centripetally? I.e. does it point toward the center of the circle? And it does so we're gonna include the force of gravity moreover because it points toward the center of the circle as opposed to radially away from the center of the circle. We're gonna include this as a positive centripetal force. Similarly, for the normal force, it also points toward the center of the circle, so we include it in this calculation and it as well will be a positive centripetal force. And now we can solve for the normal force. If I solve algebraically, I can multiply both sides by the mass and then I'd subtract MG from both sides. And that would give me the mass times V squared over R minus the magnitude of the force of gravity, which if we plug in numbers, gives us four kilograms times eight meters per second squared, you can't forget the square, divided by a two meter radius minus the magnitude of the force of gravity which is four kilograms times G which if you multiply that out gives you 88.8 newtons. This is how much downward force is exerted on the ball from the track but from Newton's Third Law, we know that that is also how much force the ball exerts upward on the track. So whatever you make this loop out of, it better be able to withstand 88.8 newtons if people are gonna be rolling this ball around the loop with eight meters per second. Now let me ask you this. What if the ball makes it over to here, right? So the ball rolls around and now it's over at this point. Now how much normal force is there at this point? Is it gonna be greater than, less than, or equal to 88.8 newtons. Well to figure it out, we should draw a force diagram. So there's gonna be a force of gravity. Again, it's gonna point straight down, and again, it's gonna be equal to at least the magnitude of it will be equal to the mass times the magnitude of acceleration due to gravity. And then we also have a normal force, but this time, the normal force does not push down. Remember, surfaces push outward and if this surface is to the left of the ball, the surface pushes to the right. This time our normal force points to the right. And let's assume this a well oiled track so there's really no friction to worry about. In that case, these would again be the only two forces. So what about the answer to our question. Will this normal force now be bigger, less than, or equal to what the normal force was at the top. Well I'm gonna argue it's gotta be bigger, and I'm gonna argue it's gonna have to be much bigger because when you plug in over here, into the centripetal forces, you only plug in forces that point radially. That is to say centripetally, either into the circle, which would be positive, or radially out of the circle, which would be negative. If they neither point into nor out of the circle, you don't include them in this calculation at all because they aren't pointing in the direction of the centripetal acceleration. In other words, they're not causing the centripetal acceleration. So for this case over here, gravity is no longer a centripetal force because the force of gravity no longer points toward the center of the circle. This force of gravity is tangential to the circle. It's neither pointing into nor out of, which means it doesn't factor into the centripetal motion at all. It merely tries to speed the ball up at this point. It does not change the ball's direction, which means it doesn't contribute to making this ball go in a circle, so we don't include it in this calculation. So when we solved for the normal force, we'd multiply both sides by M, we would not have an MG anymore. So we wouldn't be subtracting this term and that's gonna make our normal force bigger. Moreover, the speed of this ball's gonna increase compared to what it was up here. So as the ball falls down, gravity's going to speed this ball up and now that it's speed is larger, and we're not subtracting anything from it, The normal force will be much greater at this point compared to what it was at the top of the loop. So recapping, when you wanna solve the centripetal force problem, always draw your force diagram first. If you choose to analyze the forces in the centripetal direction, in other words, for the direction in toward the center of the circle, make sure you only plug in forces that are into, radially into the circle or radially out of the circle. If they're radially into the circle, you make them positive. If they were radially out of the circle, you would make them negative. And if they neither point radially inward, toward the center of the circle or radially outward, away from the center of the circle, you just do not include those forces at all when using this centripetal direction.",science_physics_centripetal-force-and-gravitation
" So right over here we have the graph of the function f. And we're assuming that f is a function of t, our horizontal axis. Here's the t-axis. So that is f of t, lowercase f of t. And now let's just, let's define another function. Let's call it capital F of, and it's not going to be a function of t. It's going to be a function of x. So capital F of x is equal to. We're gonna definite it as the definite integral between t is equal to negative 5 and t is equal to x. Actually let me make those x's in the same color so they really stand out. So f of x is equal to the definite integral between t is equal to negative 5 and t is equal to x of f of t, f of t dt. And if I had my druthers I'd probably wouldn't use capital f and lower case f, I would use like a g or capital G just so that when I say F, you don't get confused. Well I'm gonna try my best to say lower-case F of t, capital F of x. So this is how we're gonna define the function capital F of x. Definite integral between t is equal to negative 5, and x of f of t, dt. Now given this definition. What I wanna think about is at what x values does capital F of x, does capital F of x equal 0? So we'll write that down. At what x values does, this is, is this, I guess you could say, this equation, at what x values is this equation true? And I encourage you to pause this video right now and try to think about it on your own. And then we can work through it together. So I'm assuming you've had a go at it, so let's just think about what this, what this function capital F of x is really talking about. Well it's the one way to think about it is it's the area below, between negative 5, between t equals negative 5 and t equals x, that is below the function f of t and above the t axis. And if the areas is the other way around, if it's below the t axis and above the function, it's gonna be negative area. So we're looking at t equals negative 5, which is this, you could say this boundary right over here. That is t is equal to negative 5. And if you put, pick an x value, let's just say x were negative 2, so if that is your x value right over here, capital F would describe, would describe this area, this area it would be a negative area because here the function is below the t axis. So, for example capital F of negative 2 would be negative. Now, what x values makes this a 0? So one might jump out at you. Well, if we just, if we made, if we put x, if we put x right at negative 5. Right at negative 5. Then there's no width, width here. There's not going to be any area. So f of, f of negative 5. F of negative 5, F of negative capital F of negative 5, I should be clear here. Capital F of negative 5, which is equal to the definite integral between t is equal to negative 5 and t is equal to negative 5, of f of t dt. F of t dt. Well you have the, you have the, you, you have the same boundaries here. So this is going to be 0, once again this area you have no width to this area. So this is going to be equal to 0. So, we can list x equals negative 5 as being one of the points. One of the x values that makes capital F of x equal 0. But let's see if we can find more of them. Let's see if we were to go, let me erase this right over here. So, this was. We're starting at t equals negative 5. Now as x gets larger and larger and larger, when x is equal to negative 3, our area. So, let's see this area right over here, this area right over here is going to be, so that is, I see that we have, it's 2, we're going from negative 5 to negative 3. So the distance right over here is two. This height, right over here, is 4. So, this area, right over here, is 2 times 4 times 1/2, which is going to be 4. And, since it's above the function and below the t-axis, we'll write this as a negative, we'll write that as a negative 4. And now, so let's see, so we're starting when x is equal to 5. Uf, capital F of x is equal to 0, that is you get further and further out, you're getting more and more negative values, that's more and more negative values. But I just picked out this point right over here because this seems like a point of transition of the function, and then we have. This region, which is just going to add more negative area to capital F of x as x gets larger and larger and larger. And this looks like a really, a quarter circle. This is, it has a quarter circle of radius 4, and now we have another quarter circle of radius 4 until we get to x equals 5. And this is actually going to be positive area. Because here our function is above the t axis. So when we've gotten this far, so all, the way I'm thinking about it, my x is, my x, when capital F of x equal negative 5 is, is 0. And now our area, as x becomes larger and larger, and larger, our area becomes negative, negative, negative, negative. Now it becomes less negative, because we're starting to add, we're starting to add. So, for example, if x is equal to 2, if x is equal to 2, we would be looking at this positive. But we still have all this huge negative area to overcome. So we're still in negative territory. But the more positive we add, we're gonna become less negative. And you go all the way to x equals positive 5 and this positive area, this quarter circle right over here of positive area, is going to exactly offset this quarter circle of negative area. You don't even have to think about what that area is, although you can obviously figure it out with pi R squared and whatever else. And so now we just have to keep adding more positive area to offset this negative 4. So how do we do that? Well the height here, the height right over here is 4, the height right over here is 4 so if we, if we can add our rectangle that is one wide and 4 high. That's positive area of 4, which this has right over here. So this is plus 4. Is going to offset this negative 4. So we go all the way to x is equal to 6. When x is equal to 6, capital F of x is going to be equal to 0. Let's write that down. So capital F. Capital f of, capital f of positive 6, of positive 6, which is going to be equal to the definite integral between negative 5 and positive 6. Positive 6 of f of t. F of t, dt, well we can break this up. We already went through it, I'm just gonna, going to make sure that we really understood what was going on. This is equal to, and I'll just to it all in one color now. This is equal to, actually I'll do it in these colors that I did here. This is equal to the integral. The integral between negative 5 and negative 3 of f of t, dt, plus the integral, plus the integral between negative 3 and 1 of f of t dt. Plus the integral between 1 and 5 of f of t, dt. That describes this right over here. And then finally, plus, plus the definite integral between 5 and 6 of f of t, dt. f of t, dt. And, this describes this negative area. This describes this positive area. These two net out to be 0. And then this area we already figured out, is. Or this definite integral I should say is negative 4. This is negative 4 and this one right over here is positive 4 and so they net out and this of course is equal to 0 which we wanted to figure out. Once again how did I do that? Well I said okay clearly when x is equal to negative 5 you have no area and then i just kept increasing, kept increasing xs to larger and larger values, I could have gone actually the other way. And, I would have had just more and more positive values there would have been nothing to offset it to get us back to 0. But, as we increased x above negative 5, the capital Fof x; the area, is more and more and more negative, but then it becomes, then we start adding positive value to it to offset the negative. And, we fully offset the negative at x is equal to 6.",math_old-integral-calculus_fundamental-theorem-of-calculus-ic
" -  So let's go ahead and work through an actual curl computation. Let's say our vector valued function V, which is a function of X, Y, and Z, this is gonna be three-dimensional, is defined by the functions, I don't know, let's say the first component is X times Y. The second one is cosine of Z, and then the last component is Z squared plus Y. Let's say. So if you take this guy, how do you compute the curl of that vector valued function? So what you do, as I mentioned in the last video, is you imagine taking this del operator and taking the cross product between that and your vector valued function. And what that means when you expand it is that del operator, you just kinda fill it with partial differential operators, you could say, but really it's just the symbol partial partial X, partial partial Y, partial partial Z. And these are things that are just waiting to take in some kind of function. So we're gonna take the cross product between that and the function that we have defined here. So I'm gonna just actually copy it over, copy it over here. And a little residue. And to compute this cross product, we take a certain determit. So I'm gonna write over here determit, and it's gonna be of a three-by-three matrix, but really it's kinda like a quote-unquote matrix, because each component has something funky. So the top row, just like we would have with any other cross product that we're computing is gonna have i, j, and k, these unit vectors in three-dimensional space. And the second row here is gonna have all of these partial differential operators, since that's the first vector in our cross product. So that's partial partial X, partial partial Y, and again, all of these are just kind of waiting to be given a function that they can take the derivative of. And then that third row is gonna be the functions that we have. So the first component here is XY, the second component is cosine of Z, cosine of Z, and then that final component is Z squared plus Y. Z squared plus Y. Now let's all get some room here, maybe make it more visible. So this is the determit we need to compute. And this is gonna be broken up into three different parts. The first one, we take this top part, i, and multiply it by the determit of this sub-matrix. So when we do that, this sub-determit, we're taking partial derivative with respect to Y of Z squared plus Y. Now as far as Y is concerned, Z looks like a constant. So Z squared is a constant, and the partial derivative of this entire guy is just one. So that'll look like one. And then we're subtracting off the partial derivative with respect to Z of cosine of Z, and that just looks the same as a derivative of cosine Z, which is negative sine, so that's negative sine of Z. So that's the first part. And then as the next part, we're gonna take j, but we're subtracting, 'cause you're always kinda thinking plus, minus, plus, when you're doing these determits. So we're gonna subtract off j, multiplied by its own little sub-determit, and this time the sub-determit is gonna involve the two columns that it's not part of. So you're imagining this first column and this second column as being part of a matrix. So the first thing you do is you take this partial derivative with respect to X of Z squared plus Y. Well no Xs show up there, right? That's Z squared and Y. Each look like constants as far as X is concerned. So that's zero. Then we take the partial with respect to Z of X times Y. And again, there's no Z that shows up there, so that's also zero, so we're kinda subtracting off zero. And then finally, we're adding this last component. We're gonna add that last component, k, multiplied by the determit of this sub-matrix of the columns that it's not part of. So this involves partial derivative with respect to X of cosine Z. Well no Xs show up there, so that's just zero. So that's just a zero. And then we're subtracting off the partial with respect to Y of X times Y. Well X looks like a constant, Y looks like the variable, so that partial derivative is just X. So we're subtracting off X. Which means if we simplify this, so the curl of our vector field, curl of our vector field as a whole, as this function of X, Y, and Z, is equal to, and that first component, the i component, we've got one minus negative sine of Z, so minus minus sine of Z. That's one plus sine of Z. And then the j component, we're subtracting off, but it's zero. Usually if you're subtracting off, you'd have to make sure to remember to flip those, but both of those are zero, so the entire j component here, or the Y component of the output, is zero. And then finally, the k component is zero minus X, so that entire thing is just negative X. And that's the curl of the function. And in general, that's how you do it. You would take a look at the way that your function is defined in each component there, and imaging taking the cross product between this del symbol, this partial partial X, partial partial Y, partial partial Z, and you take the cross product between that and your function, and it involves taking six different partial derivatives. And mainly it's a matter of bookkeeping to make sure you do it right. And you'll end up with something like this.",math_multivariable-calculus_multivariable-derivatives
" Solve and eliminate any extraneous solutions. And what they mean by extraneous solutions are, in the course of solving this rational equation right here, we might get some solutions that if we actually put it into the original problem would give us undefined expressions. And so those solutions are extraneous solutions. They actually don't apply. You actually want to throw them out. And so let's look at this equation. We have x squared over x plus 2 is equal to 4 over x plus 2. So right from the get-go, we don't know if this is going to necessarily be a solution to this equation. But we know, just looking at this, that if x is equal to negative 2, then this denominator and this denominator are going to be 0. And you're dividing by 0. It would be undefined. So we can, right from the get-go, exclude x is equal to negative 2. So x cannot be equal to negative 2. That would make either of these expressions undefined, on either side of the equation. So with that out of the way, let's try to solve it. So as a first step, we want to get the x plus 2 out of the denominator. So let's multiply both sides by x plus 2. X plus 2 divided by x plus 2 is just 1. And we can assume that x plus 2 isn't 0. So it's going to be defined. x plus 2 divided by x plus 2 is just 1. And so our equation has simplified to x squared is equal to 4. And you could probably do this in your head, but I want to do it properly. So you can write this. You could subtract 4 from both sides. Do it in kind of the proper quadratic equation form. So x squared minus 4 is equal to 0. I just subtracted 4 from both sides over here. And so you could factor this. This is a difference of squares. You get x plus 2 times x minus 2 is equal to 0. And then if this is equal to 0, if the product of two things are equal to 0, that means either one or both of them are equal to 0. So this tells us that x plus 2 is equal to 0 or x minus 2 is equal to 0. If you subtract 2 from both sides of this equation right here, you get x is equal to negative 2. If you add 2 to both sides of this equation right over here, you get x is equal to 2. And we're saying that either of these would make this last expression 0. Now, we know that we need to exclude one of them. We know that x cannot be equal to negative 2. So x equals negative 2 is an extraneous solution. It's not really a solution for-- it is a solution for this, once we got rid of the rational expressions. But it's not a solution for this original problem up here, because it would make the expressions undefined. It would cause you to divide by 0. So the only solution here is x is equal to 2. And you can check it yourself. If you do 2 squared, you get 4, over 2 plus 2 is 4. And that should be equal to 4 over 2 plus 2, over 4, which it definitely does. 1 is equal to 1.",math_algebra-home_alg-rational-expr-eq-func
" In this video, I'm going to do several examples of quadratic equations that are really of a special form, and it's really a bit of warm-up for the next video that we're going to do on completing the square. So let me show you what I'm talking about. So let's say I have 4x plus 1 squared, minus 8 is equal to 0. Now, based on everything we've done so far, you might be tempted to multiply this out, then subtract 8 from the constant you get out here, and then try to factor it. And then you're going to have x minus something, times x minus something else is equal to 0. And you're going to say, oh, one of these must be equal to 0, so x could be that or that. We're not going to do that this time, because you might see something interesting here. We can solve this without factoring it. And how do we do that? Well, what happens if we add 8 to both sides of this equation? Then the left-hand side of the equation becomes 4x plus 1 squared, and these 8's cancel out. The right-hand becomes just a positive 8. Now, what can we do to both sides of this equation? And this is just kind of straight, vanilla equation-solving. This isn't any kind of fancy factoring. We can take the square root of both sides of this equation. We could take the square root. So 4x plus 1-- I'm just taking the square root of both sides. You take the square root of both sides, and, of course, you want to take the positive and the negative square root, because 4x plus 1 could be the positive square root of 8, or it could be the negative square root of 8. So 4x plus 1 is equal to the positive or negative square root of 8. Instead of 8, let me write 8 as 4 times 2. We all know that's what 8 is, and obviously the square root of 4x plus 1 squared is 4x plus 1. So we get 4x plus 1 is equal to-- we can factor out the 4, or the square root of 4, which is 2-- is equal to the plus or minus times 2 times the square root of 2, right? Square root of 4 times square root of 2 is the same thing as square root of 4 times the square root of 2, plus or minus the square root of 4 is that 2 right there. Now, it might look like a really bizarro equation, with this plus or minus 2 times the square of 2, but it really isn't. These are actually two numbers here, and we're actually simultaneously solving two equations. We could write this as 4x plus 1 is equal to the positive 2, square root of 2, or 4x plus 1 is equal to negative 2 times the square root of 2. This one statement is equivalent to this right here, because we have this plus or minus here, this or statement. Let me solve all of these simultaneously. So if I subtract 1 from both sides of this equation, what do I have? On the left-hand side, I'm just left with 4x. On the right-hand side, I have-- you can't really mathematically, I mean, you could do them if you had a calculator, but I'll just leave it as negative 1 plus or minus the square root, or 2 times the square root of 2. That's what 4x is equal to. If we did it here, as two separate equations, same idea. Subtract 1 from both sides of this equation, you get 4x is equal to negative 1 plus 2, times the square root of 2. This equation, subtract 1 from both sides. 4x is equal to negative 1 minus 2, times the square root of 2. This statement right here is completely equivalent to these two statements. Now, last step, we just have to divide both sides by 4, so you divide both sides by 4, and you get x is equal to negative 1 plus or minus 2, times the square root of 2, over 4. Now, this statement is completely equivalent to dividing each of these by 4, and you get x is equal to negative 1 plus 2, times the square root 2, over 4. This is one solution. And then the other solution is x is equal to negative 1 minus 2 roots of 2, all of that over 4. That statement and these two statements are equivalent. And if you want, I encourage you to-- let's substitute one of these back in, just so you feel confident that something as bizarro as one of these expressions can be a solution to a nice, vanilla-looking equation like this. So let's substitute it back in. 4 times x, or 4 times negative 1, plus 2 root 2, over 4, plus 1 squared, minus 8 is equal to 0. Now, these 4's cancel out, so you're left with negative 1 plus 2 roots 2, plus 1, squared, minus 8 is equal to 0. This negative 1 and this positive 1 cancel out, so you're left with 2 roots of 2 squared, minus 8 is equal to 0. And then what are you going to have here? So when you square this, you get 4 times 2, minus 8 is equal to 0, which is true. 8 minus 8 is equal to 0. And if you try this one out, you're going to get the exact same answer. Let's do another one like this. And remember, these are special forms where we have squares of binomials in our expression. And we're going to see that the entire quadratic formula is actually derived from a notion like this, because you can actually turn any, you can turn any, quadratic equation into a perfect square equalling something else. We'll see that two videos from now. But let's get a little warmed up just seeing this type of thing. So let's say you have x squared minus 10x, plus 25 is equal to 9. Now, once again your temptation-- and it's not a bad temptation-- would be to subtract 9 from both sides, so you get a 0 on the right-hand side, but before you do that, just inspect this really fast. And say, hey, is this just maybe a perfect square of a binomial? And you see-- well, what two numbers when I multiply them I get positive 25, and when I add them I get negative 10? And hopefully negative 5 jumps out at you. So this expression right here is x minus 5, times x minus 5. So this left-hand side can be written as x minus 5 squared, and the right-hand side is still 9. And I want to really emphasize. I don't want this to ruin all of the training you've gotten on factoring so far. We can only do this when this is a perfect square. If you got, like, x minus 3, times x plus 4, and that would be equal to 9, that would be a dead end. You wouldn't be able to really do anything constructive with that. Only because this is a perfect square, can we now say x minus 5 squared is equal to 9, and now we can take the square root of both sides. So we could say that x minus 5 is equal to plus or minus 3. Add 5 to both sides of this equation, you get x is equal to 5 plus or minus 3, or x is equal to-- what's 5 plus 3? Well, x could be 8 or x could be equal to 5 minus 3, or x is equal to 2. Now, we could have done this equation, this quadratic equation, the traditional way, the way you were tempted to do it. What happens if you subtract 9 from both sides of this equation? You'll get x squared minus 10x. And what's 25 minus 9? 25 minus 9 is 16, and that would be equal to 0. And here, this would be just a traditional factoring problem, the type that we've seen in the last few videos. What two numbers, when you take their product, you get positive 16, and when you sum them you get negative 10? And maybe negative 8 and negative 2 jump into your brain. So we get x minus 8, times x minus 2 is equal to 0. And so x could be equal to 8 or x could be equal to 2. That's the fun thing about algebra: you can do things in two completely different ways, but as long as you do them in algebraically-valid ways, you're not going to get different answers. And on some level, if you recognize this, this is easier because you didn't have to do that little game in your head, in terms of, oh, what two numbers, when you multiply them you get 16, and when you add them you get negative 10? Here, you just said, OK, this is x minus 5-- oh, I guess you did have to do it. You had to say, oh, 5 times 5 is 25, and negative 10 is negative 5 plus negative 5. So I take that back, you still have to do that little game in your head. So let's do another one. Let's do one more of these, just to really get ourselves nice and warmed up here. So, let's say we have x squared plus 18x, plus 81 is equal to 1. So once again, we can do it in two ways. We could subtract 1 from both sides, or we could recognize that this is x plus 9, times x plus 9. This right here, 9 times 9 is 81, 9 plus 9 is 18. So we can write our equation as x plus 9 1squared is equal to 1. 1Take the square root of both sides, you get x plus 9 is 1equal to plus or minus the square root of 1, 1which is just 1. 1So x is equal to-- subtract 9 from both sides-- negative 9 1plus or minus 1. 1And that means that x could be equal to-- negative 9 plus 1 1is negative 8, or x could be equal to-- negative 9 minus 1, 1which is negative 10. 1And once again, you could have done this the traditional way. 1You could have subtracted 1 from both sides and you would 1have gotten x squared plus 18x, plus 80 is equal to 0. 1And you'd say, hey, gee, 8 times 10 is 80, 8 plus 10 is 118, so you get x plus 8, times x plus 10 is equal to 0. 1And then you'd get x could be equal to negative 8, or x 1could be equal to negative 10. 1That was good warm up. 1Now, I think we're ready to tackle completing the square.",math_algebra-home_alg-quadratics
" -  Now the last type of bond I'm going to talk about is known as the metallic bond, which I think I know a little bit about because I was the lead singer of a metallic bond in high school. I'll talk about that in future videos. But let's just take one of our metallic atoms here. Iron is a good example. Iron is maybe one of the most referred to metals. Let's say we have a bunch of iron atoms. So Fe, Fe, Fe, Fe, hope you can read that. These are all iron atoms. And if they're just atoms by themselves they're going to be neutral. But when they are mushed together, they will form a metallic bond. Makes sense because they're metals. And what's interesting about metallic bonds, I'll draw it down here, is that metals like to share their electrons with the other metals. It kinda forms this sea of electrons. So what it can look like is, each of the irons lose an electron, I'll draw it a little bit bigger. So let's say this is Fe plus, so it has a positive charge. Fe plus has a positive charge. Fe plus, these are all iron ions, you can imagine. Fe plus, and we're imagining that they have this positive charge because they've all contributed an electron to this sea of electrons. So you have an electron here which has a negative charge. And electrons are not this big, but this is just so that you can see it. Electron here that has a negative charge. And so you can imagine these positive ions are attracted to the sea of negativity, the sea of negative electrons. Another way to think about it is, is that metals, when they bond in metallic bonds, they will have overlapping valence electrons. And those valence electrons are not fixed to just one of the atoms, they can move around. And this is what gives metals many of the characteristics we associate with metals. It conducts electricity because these electrons can move around quite easily. It makes them malleable, you can bend it easily. You can imagine these iron ions in this pudding, or this sea of electrons. So you can bend it, it doesn't break. Well if you were to take a bar of a salt right over here, if you were to try to bend it, it's very rigid. It is going to break. So there we have it, the types of bonds. It's important to realize that you can view it as something of a spectrum. At one end, you have things like ionic bonds where one character swipes an electron from another character and says, ""Hey, but now we're attracted to each other,"" and you get something like salt. Or you have covalent bonds where we outright share electrons. And then you have things in between covalent bonds and ionic bonds where the sharing is not so equal and you get polar covalent bonds. And then another form, I guess you could say, of extreme sharing is the metallic bonds where you just have this communal sea of electrons.",science_ap-chemistry_chemical-bonds-ap
" SALMAN KHAN: I'm here with Dr. David Agus, who is a professor of engineering and medicine at USC. DAVID AGUS: Um-huh. SALMAN KHAN: And we're looking at pictures here of things that seem very different to me. What is the commonality right here? DAVID AGUS: The commonality is inflammation. So inflammation can be manifest by a runny nose in a cold or getting the flu. It could be manifest by an infection in your toes. It could be hitting your head playing football or hitting your arm when you fall playing a sport. All of those can cause inflammation. SALMAN KHAN: Because inflammation has a certain meaning in everyday language. At least when I imagine it, it means something that's swollen and red. But here, we're talking about inflammation in more of the medical or the scientific sense. Things are swollen and red because of inflammation. DAVID AGUS: Right. SALMAN KHAN: And so what is inflammation? It isn't just swollen and redness. I mean, the football player isn't getting swollen and red, or is he? DAVID AGUS: So inflammation is when your body senses danger. So when something is wrong, whether it be an infection, whether it be trauma in the case of football players, whether it be a cold, your body senses danger and sends in its frontline soldiers, which are the immune cells, in order to fight whatever's causing it. So if it's trauma, the immune cells go in there and they help rebuild the tissue that's damaged. If it's a bacteria, they go in there and they try to take away the bacteria so you can get over that cold or that flu. And so that whole process we call inflammation. SALMAN KHAN: I see. DAVID AGUS: It's a danger process. SALMAN KHAN: So it's the immune cells going to the sign of danger to either fight the danger itself or repair the aftermath-- DAVID AGUS: Yup. SALMAN KHAN: --of the danger. So that sounds like a good thing. DAVID AGUS: It's an awesome thing. The problem is, your body, all of us, we care about what happens today, not down the road. SALMAN KHAN: Right. DAVID AGUS: And this is one of the take home points that astonished me when I start to think about it, is that nature, evolution, selects out, for who has good kids. And that's what evolution is about. It's about having children. We call progeny. SALMAN KHAN: Right DAVID AGUS: It's not about what happens when you're 80 years old or 90 years old. And so inflammation is fantastic about dealing with today's ramifications. The problem is if you get the flu today, your risk of cancer and heart disease a decade or two decades from now are up. SALMAN KHAN: If I get the flu once? DAVID AGUS: If you get the flu once. SALMAN KHAN: Really. DAVID AGUS: So those five, six days-- SALMAN KHAN: You're worrying me. DAVID AGUS: --when you feel horrible, your inflammation is through the roof. That's having ramifications down the road. SALMAN KHAN: Right. I mean this is already getting a little scary for me because I've had the flu. So I already feel a little worried about my cancer risk. DAVID AGUS: I can tell by looking at you. [LAUGHTER] SALMAN KHAN: You can tell by looking at-- [LAUGHTER] And the symptoms that we get when we have the flu or a cold, these are actually-- it's not the virus that's-- the virus is causing the inflammation, which is causing the symptoms. DAVID AGUS: Yeah. And that's what's wild. Is that when you get a virus, your immune system attacks it and you get a fever. I still don't know why we get fevers. It's one of those things where the-- we call them the cytokines, which are proteins the immune cells make to send out and get more reinforcements and tell the body what to do. It causes a fever. Is a fever good? Is a fever bad? I don't know. We take Tylenol to lower a fever, but is that a good thing? Nobody really has looked at the long-term ramifications. They look at short term. But how does it affect a decade from now what's going to happen? We just don't know. SALMAN KHAN: Wow. Wow. And what you're saying is that the reason why we have inflammation is, yeah, something has happened to my body. I have some trauma, some injury. And you were saying this to me earlier, you might have to run away from a lion tomorrow. So fix Sal or fix David up right now, so that he can run away from the lion tomorrow. But in the wild, I might only live to 40 anyway. So why even worry about whether that person might get cancer if they get to 40 or 50, once they're past the age of reproduction. DAVID AGUS: Eactly. The body has to choose priorities. And the priority clearly is today rather than tomorrow. And so an amazing study was done in that we gave patients what we call a statin. So statins were drugs-- S-T-A-T-I-N. They were drugs that were developed because they blocked the synthesis of cholesterol. SALMAN KHAN: Right. DAVID AGUS: And we thought people with higher cholesterol, particularly the bad one called LDL, those people have a higher incidence of heart disease. So if we block the synthesis, we're going to affect heart disease. And what do you know, we did. A dramatic effect, we lowered the death from heart disease with these drugs. SALMAN KHAN: Right. So it seems like they worked. DAVID AGUS: They worked. Then a company, or a very clever group, did a trial where they gave people with normal cholesterol these drugs. And they had a dramatic effect in that it delayed heart attack and stroke by almost a dozen years. SALMAN KHAN: Wow. DAVID AGUS: And it reduced the incidence of cancer by about 40%. SALMAN KHAN: So cancer, something-- I mean we don't associate cholesterol-- DAVID AGUS: Totally different. SALMAN KHAN: Wow. DAVID AGUS: So it turns out these drugs, which were the biggest drug in terms of sales we've ever had, worked by lowering inflammation. So their effect in heart disease wasn't by lowering cholesterol. It was predomitly by lowering inflammation. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. DAVID AGUS: And the effect on cancer was by lowering inflammation. In fact, do you remember when the swine flu came out a couple years ago? SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. DAVID AGUS: So if you got the swine flu, the only thing that protected you from your lungs collapsing and going on what we call a ventilator, a breathing machine, was being on one of these statins. SALMAN KHAN: Because it would stop the inflammation. Because the swine flu people were dying from is the inflammation going nuts. DAVID AGUS: Yeah. SALMAN KHAN: This is fascinating. So the people who are dying of heart disease, is it necessarily the cholesterol that's killing them? Or is the inflammation that's causing cholesterol? DAVID AGUS: Well, I think it's this chicken and the egg phenomenon. That's it. The inflammation allows cholesterol to deposit-- SALMAN KHAN: I see. DAVID AGUS: --and they together. SALMAN KHAN: I see. I see. So it's really the statin affects inflammation, which then reduces cancer by stopping the inflammation and stopping the-- DAVID AGUS: Exactly. SALMAN KHAN: --cholesterol. DAVID AGUS: One of those problems we have a biology, in medicine, it's what you can measure. And so I can measure cholesterol. SALMAN KHAN: Right. DAVID AGUS: I don't really know how to measure inflammation well. So while we can make these association in big studies when we look back, if I had a metric, if I had a blood test or something to look at for inflammation, I can optimize things. SALMAN KHAN: Can you not measure just the amount of cytokines and other inflammatory type of things that become increased in your-- does it happen? DAVID AGUS: You're right. But are different types of inflammation. So some inflammation can be good, some can be bad. Some can be really causal. Some could be a little bit causal. And so we're putting them all into one basket now, which is inflammation. The key is to start to tease them out and be able to modulate them. You can develop a drug. But then you have to optimize it for a particular purpose. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. DAVID AGUS: So these were optimized to lower cholesterol. And they do that very well. They also lower inflammation and they work beautifully in that regard. But how do we optimize that going forward? What it also means is that when you look at your lifestyle and my lifestyle, we have to limit inflammation. So what are the easy ways to do that? One is, which I think should be mandatory things, like the flu shot. SALMAN KHAN: Right. DAVID AGUS: So again, the flu shot will certainly delay you from having or prevent from having bad flu. SALMAN KHAN: That's good today and good today and tomorrow. DAVID AGUS: And tomorrow-- SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. DAVID AGUS: --because it limits heart disease and cancer down the road. That SALMAN KHAN: I had no clue that the flu-- I thought it was just a nice thing, avoid a week of sneezing, and you know. But the flu shot, you can actually reduce your cancer-- DAVID AGUS: And heart disease down the road. And we have to think long term as a society. SALMAN KHAN: What about statins? I mean it seems like-- these are drugs like Lipitor and Crestor. I mean would you-- I mean no one should take our medical advice based on a thing in video. DAVID AGUS: Right. SALMAN KHAN: I mean are people taking it just for heart disease or are people taking it more broadly now? DAVID AGUS: Listen. I mean I'm a believer that these drugs have such a profound effect on cancer, heart disease, stroke, potentially Alzheimer's, that you should consider taking it to prevent these diseases. And again, we're giving no recommendations. But what I say is you, your parents, they should talk about it with their doctor. And so why shouldn't I be on this drug? SALMAN KHAN: Right. And there are some side effects. But they're easy to test for. DAVID AGUS: Test for, and then they're reversible. SALMAN KHAN: Right. OK. So you're not going too-- DAVID AGUS: So with anything, you got to do a risk and a benefit. SALMAN KHAN: Right. DAVID AGUS: And you have to look at you and say am I high risk for X, Y, and Z? If you are, what can prevent or delay it? The name of the game is not treating disease, it's preventing disease. SALMAN KHAN: Right. Right. Now, this is fascinating. Well, I might talk to my wife about getting some-- well, no advice here. Everyone should talk to their doctor. DAVID AGUS: By the way, another great medicine to reduce inflammation is called aspirin. SALMAN KHAN: Aspirin, I've heard of that. DAVID AGUS: Yeah. It's a hell of a drug. Again, there are side effects to aspirin. It can affect bleeding. But at the same time, it's a dramatic effect by lowering inflammation. SALMAN KHAN: Right. And that is its main side effect. I mean it's this age-old drug. It's a blood thinner. So if you get a cut or you bleed while you're taking aspirin, you might bleed more. DAVID AGUS: Right. Blood thinner is a funny term. I'm not quite sure what it means. I keep taking paint thinner when you see it. SALMAN KHAN: Right. That's kind of how I imagine it. DAVID AGUS: It binds to the platelets and blocks them from activating. It stops them from working really well. SALMAN KHAN: So it's more anticlotting. DAVID AGUS: Right. And platelets are one of the key components of clotting. And they certainly affect it. SALMAN KHAN: Right. So your blood will have the same viscosity. It just won't clot as easily. DAVID AGUS: Exactly. And you could certainly paint a wall with either one. SALMAN KHAN: That's a little morbid. All right. Well, thanks a bunch.",science_health-and-medicine_healthcare-misc
" I was just looking on the discussion boards on the Khan Academy Facebook page, and Bud Denny put up this problem, asking for it to be solved. And it seems like a problem of general interest. If the indefinite integral of 2 to the natural log of x over, everything over x, dx. And on the message board, Abhi Khanna also put up a solution, and it is the correct solution, but I thought this was of general interest, so I'll make a quick video on it. So the first thing when you see an integral like this, is you say, hey, you know, I have this natural log of x up in the numerator, and where do I start? And the first thing that should maybe pop out at you, is that this is the same thing as the integral of one over x times 2 to the natural log of x, dx. And so you have an expression here, or it's kind of part of our larger function, and you have its derivative, right? We know that the derivative, let me write it over here, we know that the derivative with respect to x of the natural log of x is equal to 1/x. So we have some expression, and we have its derivative, which tells us that we can use substitution. Sometimes you can do in your head, but this problem, it's still not trivial to do in your head. So let's make the substitution. Let's substitute this right here with a u. So let's do that. So if you define u, and it doesn't have to be u, it's just, that's the convention, it's called u-substitution, it could have been s-substitution for all we care. Let's say u is equal to the natural log of x, and then du dx, the derivative of u with respect to x, of course is equal to 1/x. Or, just the differential du, if we just multiply both sides by dx is equal to 1 over x dx. So let's make our substitution. This is our integral. So this will be equal to the indefinite integral, or the antiderivative, of 2 to the now u, so 2 to the u, times 1 over x dx. Now what is 1 over x dx? That's just du. So this term times that term is just our du. Let me do it in a different color. 1 over x times dx is just equal to du. That's just equal to that thing, right there. Now, this still doesn't look like an easy integral, although it's gotten simplified a good bit. And to solve, you know, whenever I see the variable that I'm integrating against in the exponent, you know, we don't have any easy exponent rules here. The only thing that I'm familiar with, where I have my x or my variable that I'm integrating against in my exponent, is the case of e to the x. We know that the integral of e to the x, dx, is equal to e to the x plus c. So if I could somehow turn this into some variation of e to the x, maybe, or e to the u, maybe I can make this integral a little bit more tractable. So let's see. How can we redefine this right here? Well, 2, 2 is equal to what? 2 is the same thing as e to the natural log of 2, right? The natural log of 2 is the power you have to raise e to to get 2. So if you raise e to that power, you're, of course going to get 2. This is actually the definition of really, the natural log. You raise e to the natural log of 2, you're going to get 2. So let's rewrite this, using this-- I guess we could call this this rewrite or-- I don't want to call it quite a substitution. It's just a different way of writing the number 2. So this will be equal to, instead of writing the number 2, I could write e to the natural log of 2. And all of that to the u du. And now what is this equal to? Well, if I take something to an exponent, and then to another exponent, this is the same thing as taking my base to the product of those exponents. So this is equal to, let me switch colors, this is equal to the integral of e, to the u, e to the, let me write it this way. e to the natural log of 2 times u. I'm just multiplying these two exponents. I raise something to something, then raise it again, we know from our exponent rules, it's just a product of those two exponents. du. Now, this is just a constant factor, right here. This could be, you know, this could just be some number. We could use a calculator to figure out what this is. We could set this equal to a. But we know in general that the integral, this is pretty straightforward, we've now put it in this form. The antiderivative of e to the au, du, is just 1 over a e to the au. This comes from this definition up here, and of course plus c, and the chain rule. If we take the derivative of this, we take the derivative of the inside, which is just going to be a. We multiply that times the one over a, it cancels out, and we're just left with e to the au. So this definitely works out. So the antiderivative of this thing right here is going to be equal to 1 over our a, it's going to be 1 over our constant term, 1 over the natural log of 2 times our whole expression, e e. And I'm going to do something. This is just some number times u, so I can write it as u times some number. And I'm just doing that to put in a form that might help us simplify it a little bit. So it's e to the u times the natural log of 2, right? All I did, is I swapped this order. I could have written this as e to the natural log of 2 times u. If this an a, a times u is the same thing as u times a. Plus c. So this is our answer, but we have to kind of reverse substitute before we can feel satisfied that we've taken the antiderivative with respect to x. But before I do that, let's see if I can simplify this a little bit. What is, if I have, just from our natural log properties, or logarithms, a times the natural log of b. We know this is the same thing as the natural log of b to the a. Let me draw a line here. Right? That this becomes the exponent on whatever we're taking the natural log of. So u, let me write this here, u times the natural log of 2, is the same thing as the natural log of 2 to the u. So we can rewrite our antiderivative as being equal to 1 over the natural log of 2, that's just that part here, times e to the, this can be rewritten based on this logarithm property, as the natural log of 2 to the u, and of course we still have our plus c there. Now, what is e raised to the natural log of 2 to the u? The natural log of 2 to the u is the power that you have to raise e to to get to 2 to the u, right? By definition! So if we raise e to that power, what are we going to get? We're going to get 2 to the u. So this is going to be equal to 1 over the natural log of 2. This simplifies to just 2 to the u. I drew it up here. The natural log a I could just write in general terms, let me do it up here, and maybe I'm beating a dead horse. But I can in general write any number a as being equal to e to the natural log of a. This is the exponent you have to raise e to to get a. If you raise e to that, you're going to get a. So e to the natural log of 2 to the u, that's just 2 to the u. And then I have my plus c, of course. And now we can reverse substitute. What did we set u equal to? We defined u, up here, as equal to the natural log of x. So let's just reverse substitute right here. And so the answer to our original equation, your answer to, let me write it here, because it's satisfying when you see it, to this kind of fairly convoluted-looking antiderivative problem, 2 to the natural log of x over x dx, we now find is equal to, we just replaced u with natural log of x, because that was our substitution, and 1 over the natural log of 2 times 2 to the natural log of x plus c. And we're done. This isn't in the denominator, the way I wrote it might look a little ambiguous. And we're done! And that was a pretty neat problem, and so thanks to Bud for posting that.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-integrals
" -  So we have a bunch of numbers listed up here, and my goal, in this video, is to see if we can classify them into different types of number categories, and let me draw the categories. So this circle, over here, this represents all of the numbers that can be represented as the fraction of two integers, and, of course, the denominator can't be equal to zero, because we don't know what it means to put a zero in the denominator. So, let's call these, or the standard way of calling these things. These things can be represented as a fraction of two integers, we call these rational numbers. Rational numbers. And if something cannot be represented as a fraction of two integers, we call irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. And the size of these circles don't show how large these sets are. There's actually an infinite number of rational and an infinite number of irrational numbers. So, these are the irrational numbers. Irrational. So, these cannot be represented as a fraction of two integers. And then, within rational numbers, you have integers themselves. So, I'll do that in, let me do that in this blue color. Integers. So, integers are numbers that don't have to be represented as a fraction or a decimal. So, these are integers, right over here. Integers. And then a subset of integers are whole numbers. So, if you essentially say the non-negative integers, you're then talking about whole numbers. So let me do that subset, right over here. So, these are going to be the whole numbers. So, whole numbers. Whole numbers, right over here. And, actually, let me just label it all. These are rational... Let me do that in the same color. Rational numbers. And, of course, irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. Irrational numbers. An integer. Well, if I could say, ""Look, that is an integer. ""Let's think about the integers."" But I wouldn't say, ""Let's just think about the rational."" I'd say, ""Let's think about the rational numbers."" All right, now that we have these categories in place, let's categorize them. Like always, pause the video. See if you can figure out what category these numbers fall into. Where would you put them on this diagram? So, let's start off with three. This is positive three. It can be definitely represented as a fraction. You can represent it as three over one. But, it doesn't have to be represented as a fraction. It, literally, could be just a three, right over there, but it's also non-negative. So three is a whole number. So three, and maybe I'll do it in the color of the category. So, three is a whole number. So, it's a member of that set. But if you're a whole number, you're also an integer, and you're also a rational number. So, three is a whole number, it's an integer, and it's a rational number. Now, let's think about negative five. Now, negative five, once again, it can be represented as a fraction, but it doesn't have to be, but it is negative. So, it's not gonna be a whole number. So, negative five is going to sit right over here. It's an integer, and if you're an integer, you're definitely going to be a rational number, but it's not a whole number because it is negative. Now we have 0.25. Well, this, for sure, can be represented as a fraction. This is 25-hundredths, right over here. So, we can represent that as a fraction of two integers, I should say. It's 25-hundredths. But there's no way to represent this except using a fraction of two integers. So, 0.25 is a rational number, but it's not an integer and not a whole number. Now what about 22 over seven. Well, here it's clearly represented, already, as a fraction of two integers, but I don't think I can represent this any other, except as a fraction of two integers. I can't somehow make this without using a fraction or some type of decimal that might repeat. So, this, right over here, this would also be a rational number, but it's not an integer, not a whole number. Now this over here. 0.2713. Now the 13 repeats. This is the same thing as 0.27131313, that's what line up there represents. Now, you might not realize it yet, but any number that repeats eventually, this one does repeat eventually, you have the .1313, or you have the 0.27131313, any number like this can be represented as a fraction. For example, and I'm not going to do it here, just for the sake of time, but, for example, 0.3, repeating, that's the same thing as one-third. And later on, we're gonna see techniques of how do you convert this to a fraction of two integers. But, for our sake, we just know that this can be represented as a fraction of two integers just the way that 0.3, repeating, can be. And so, we would put this under rational numbers. 0.2713, repeating. But you have to represent it either as a decimal or a fraction of integers. If you didn't have to, then it could have been an integer, but we'll throw it up there in rational numbers. Now the square root of ten. Square root of ten. This is interesting. So, any square root of a non-perfect square is going to be irrational. So, this is gonna be irrational. I'm not proving it to you here, but you cannot represent this as the ratio of two integers, or a fraction with two integers, with an integer in the numerator and an integer in the denominator. This will be, if you were to represent it as a decimal, it will not repeat. It'll just keep being new and new digits. It will not repeat over time. So, this, right over here, is an irrational number. It's not rational. It cannot be represented as the ratio of two integers. All right, 14 over seven. This is the ratio of two integers. So, this, for sure, is rational. But if you think about it, 14 over seven, that's another way of saying, 14 over seven is the same thing as two. These two things are equivalent. So, 14 over seven is the same thing as two. So, this is actually a whole number. It doesn't look like a whole number, but, remember, a whole number is a non-negative number that doesn't need to be represented as the ratio of two integers. And this one, even though we did represent it as the ratio of two integers, it doesn't need to be represented as the ratio of two integers. You could have represent this as just two. So, that's going to be a whole number. 14 over seven, which is the same thing as two, that is a whole number. Now, two-pi. Now pi is an irrational... Pi is an irrational number. So if we just take a multiple of pi, if we just take a integer multiple of pi, like that, this is also going to be an irrational number. If you looked at its decimal representation, it will never repeat. So that's two-pi, right over there. Now what about... Let me do that same, since I've been consistent, relatively consistent, with the colors. So, this is two-pi right over there. Now, what about the negative square root of 25. Well, 25's a perfect square. Square root of that's just gonna be five. So, this thing is going to be, this thing is going to be equivalent to negative five. So, this is just another representation of this, right over here. So, it is an integer. It's not a whole number because it's negative, but it's an integer. Negative square root of 25. These two things are actually... These two things are actually the same number, just different ways of representing them. And then you have, let's see, you have the square root of nine over... The square root of nine over seven. Well, what's the principal root of nine? This thing is gonna be the same thing, this thing is the same... Let me do this in a different color. This is the same thing as, square root of nine is three, it's the principal root of nine, so it's three-sevenths. So, this is a ratio of two integers. This is a rational number. Square root of nine over seven is the same thing as three-sevenths. Now, let me just give you one more just for the road. What about pi over pi? What is that going to be? Well, pi divided by pi is going to be equal to one. So, this is actually a whole number. So I could write pi over pi, right over there. That's just a very fancy way of saying one.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-numbers-operations
" We have an interesting looking diagram here. Let's see if we know a few things about this diagram. Let's say we know that line MK is parallel to line NJ. So this line is parallel to this line. This is line MK, this is line NJ. Now, given that and all the other information on this diagram, I'm hoping to prove that the measure of this angle LMK is equal to the measure of this angle over here and this angle is LNJ. Another way of writing this is; the measure of LMK is b and the measure of LNK is a. So we want to prove that b is equal to a using all this information that we know. Like always I encourage you to try this on your own before I walk through it. Alright, let's walk through it. The first thing you might see is I have a triangle formed up here, triangle MLK. What do we know about the measurement of the interior angles of a triangle? The measures of the interior angles of a triangle are going to add up to 180 degrees. We know that b, which is the measure of this angle plus the measure of this angle, c plus the measure of this right angle, which is plus 90 degrees is going to be equal to 180 degrees. And so if we subtract 90 degrees from both sides we're going to get b plus c is equal to 180 degrees minus 90 degrees. It's going to be 90 degrees. Or if we wanted to solve explicitly for b we could subtract c from both sides, and we could write b is equal to 90 degrees minus c. So that's interesting, that's one way of expressing b. Can we express a in a similar way? Once again, if at any point you get inspired I encourage you to do that. If we look carefully we see that we have triangle NLJ, this really big triangle, it's really most of the diagram. What's interesting about NLJ is that J is another right triangle, c is one of the measures of one of the interior angles, and a is a measure of the other interior angle. We can write something very similar, we can write a plus c plus 90 degrees is going to be equal to 180 degrees. So what can we do here? We can do the exact same process to solve for a. If we subtract 90 from both sides and we subtract c from both sides what do we get? We get a is equal to 90 degrees and if you subtract c from both sides you're going to get 90 degrees minus c. Now this is interesting, b is equal to 90 degrees minus c and a is equal to 90 degrees minus c. So 90 degrees minus c is equal to a, it's also equal to b. Or, we can now say that a must be equal to b, that the measure of angle LMK which is b is equal to the measure of angle LNJ which is equal to a.",math_engageny-geo_geo-1
"  Let's do some more nonhomogeneous equations. So let's take the same problem, but we'll change the right-hand side. Because I think you know how to solve the-- essentially, the homogeneous version. So the same problem as we did in the last video. The second derivative of y minus 3 times the first derivative y minus 4 times the function. And now in the last example, the nonhomogeneous part was 3e to the 2x. But we're tired of dealing with exponent functions, so let's make it a trigonometric function. So let's say it equals 2 sin of x. So the first step you do is what we've been doing. You essentially solve the homogeneous equation. So this left-hand side is equal to 0. You do that by getting the characteristic equation r squared minus 3r minus 4 is equal to 0. You get the solutions, r is equal equal to 4, r is equal to minus 1, and then you get that general solution. We did this in the last video. You get the general solution of the homogeneous. Maybe we'll call this the homogeneous solution. y homogeneous. We've got the C1 e to the 4x plus C2e to the minus x. And that's all and good, but in order to get the general solution of this nonhomogeneous equation, I have to take the solution of the nonhomogeneous equation, if this were equal to 0, and then add that to a particular solution that satisfies this equation. That satisfies-- when you take the second derivative minus 3 times the first minus 4 times the function, I actually get 2 sin of x. And here once again we'll use undetermined coefficients. And undetermined coefficients, just think to yourself. What function, when I take its second and first derivatives and add and subtract multiples of them to each other, will I get sine of x? Well, two functions end up with sine of x when you take the first and second derivatives. And the sine and cosine of x. So it's a good guess. And that's really what you're doing it the method of undetermined coefficients. You take a guess of a particular solution and then you solve for the undetermined coefficients. So let's say that our guess is y is equal to-- I don't know, some coefficient times sine of x. And if this was sine of 2x, I'd put A times sine of 2x here. Just because I still want-- no matter what happens here-- the sine of 2x's or maybe cosine of 2x's to still exist. If this was a sine of 2x, there's nothing I could do to a sine of x, or nothing at least trivial that I could do to the sine of x. It would end up with a sine of 2x. So whatever's here, I want here. Plus B, some undetermined coefficient times cosine of x. And once again, this was sine of 2x. I'd want a cosine of 2x here. So let's figure out its first and second derivatives. So the first derivative of this y prime is equal to A cosine of x. Cosine derivative is minus sine, so minus B sine of x. And then the second derivitive-- I'll write down here. The second derivative is equal to what? Derivative of cosine is minus sine, so minus A sine of x minus B cosine of x.  I think you're starting to see that the hardest thing in most differential equations problems is not making careless mistakes. It's a lot of algebra and a lot of fairly basic calculus. And the real trick is to not make careless mistakes. Every time I say that, I tend to make one. So I'm going to focus extra right now. So anyway, let's take these and substitute them back into this nonhomogeneous equation. Let's see if I can solve for A and B. So the second derivative is that.  Let me just rewrite it, just so that you see what I'm doing. So I'm going to take the second derivative, y prime prime, so that's minus A sine of x minus B cosine of x. I'm going to add minus 3 times the first derivative to that. And I'm going to write the sines under the sines and the cosines under the consines. So minus 3 times this. So the sine is, let's see. It's plus 3B sine of x minus 3 times this. So minus 3A cosine of x. And then minus 4 times our original function. So minus 4A sine of x. Right? Minus 4 times that. Minus 4 times this. Minus 4B cosine of x. And when I take the sum of all of those-- that's essentially the left-hand side to this equation-- when I take the sum of all of that, that is equal to 2 sine of x. I could have written them out in a line, but it would have just been more confusing. And now this makes it easy to add up the sine of x's and the cosine of x's. So if I add up all the coefficients on the sine of x, I get minus A plus 3B minus 4A. So that looks like minus 5A plus 3B sine of x plus-- and now what are the coefficients here?  I have minus B and then I have another minus 4B, so minus 5B and then minus 3A. So minus 3A minus 5B cosine of x. The cosine of x should go right here. So anyway, how do I solve for A and B? Well, I have the minus 5A 3B is equal to whatever coefficients in front of sine of x here. So minus 5A plus 3B must be equal to 2. And then minus 3A minus 5B is the coefficient on cosine of x, although I kind of squeezed in the cosine of x here, right? So this must be equal to whatever the coefficient on cosine of x is on the right-hand side. Well the coefficient of cosine of x on the right-hand side is 0. So that sets up a system of two unknowns with two equations. A linear system. So we get minus 5A plus 3B is equal to 2. And we get minus 3A minus 5B is equal to 0.  And let's see if I can simplify this a little bit. Let's see. This is a system of two unknowns, two equations. If I multiply the top equation by 5 1/3s, right? Actually, let me multiply the top equation by 5 1/3s. I get minus 25/3 A plus 5B is equal to 5 1/3s times this. 5 1/3s times 2 is 10 1/3s. And the bottom equation is minus 3A minus 5B is equal to 0. Let's add the two equations. I get 10 1/3s is equal to-- these cancel out. That's minus 25/3 minus 9/3 A is equal to 10 1/3s. This is getting a little bit messier than I like, but we'll soldier on. So minus 25 minus 9. What's minus 25 minus 9? So that is 34. So we get 34 over 3A is equal to 10/3. We can multiply both sides by 3. Divide both sides by 34. A is equal to 10/34, which is equal to 5/17. Nice ugly number. 5/17 and now we can solve for B. So let's see. Minus 3 times A minus 3 times A. 5/17 minus 5B is equal to 0. So that's what? Minus 15/17 is equal to plus 5B. I just took this and put it on the right-hand side. And then divide both sides by 5.  Oh, you know what? I realized I made a careless mistake here. Minus 25 minus 9. That's the minus 34 over 3. so minus 34A is equal to 10. A is equal to minus 10/34 or minus 5/17. So minus 3 times minus 5/17. So 5/17 is equal to plus 5B, right? And then we get B is equal to 3/17. 1That was hairy. 1And notice, the hard part was not losing 1your negative sines. 1But anyway, we now have our particular solution to this. 1 1let me try to write in a non-nauseating color, although 1I think I picked a nauseating one. 1The particular solution is A minus 5/17 sine of x-- right? 1That was a coefficient on sine of x-- plus B plus 3/17 times 1cosine of x. 1And if we look at our original problem, the general solution 1out of this nonhomogeneous equation would be this-- which 1is the general solution to the homogeneous equation, which 1we've done many videos on-- plus now our particular 1solution that we solved using the method of undetermined 1coefficient. 1So if you just take that and add it to that, you're done. 1And I am out of time. 1See you in the next video.",math_differential-equations_second-order-differential-equations
" One interesting thing we know about how our brain retrieves information is that, unfortunately, it doesn't work like a computer pulling up a file. When you save a document on your computer, it will look exactly the same next time you open it. Whether you open it today, tomorrow, or next year, that document will be exactly the same as the moment that you saved it. Our brain, however, doesn't work that way. Every time we retrieve a memory, we modify it slightly. This is why memory is sometimes described as being reconstructive. Whenever we think we're remembering something picture perfect, we are actually changing that memory in small ways, according to our mood, goals, or environment. You might think of someone telling a story about a fish they caught. The first time they tell the story, it's a small fish. But every time they retell the story the fish gets bigger. Sometimes these alterations are due to our own desires or moods. If there's a gap in our memory, then our brain might fill it in with something logical or desirable. Another factor that can affect our ability to retrieve accurate information is receiving false or misleading information after we encode something but before we try to retrieve it ourselves. For example, one study had people watch a video in which a car stopped at a yield sign. After the video, participants received a written description of it. And some of those descriptions had false information. They said that the car stopped at a stop sign instead of a yield sign. People who got this description were more likely to report they'd actually seen a stop sign in the video than people who didn't get this description. Similarly, another study showed the example of misleading information, so not necessarily false information but just misleading. People watched a traffic safety video in which they observed a car crash. Immediately after the video, people were asked questions about what happened. And the key question was, how fast were the cars going when they hit each other? Except some people got the question with the verb hit, like I just read. And some people got the question with the verb smashed instead of hit. A tiny difference, right? But a couple weeks later those same participants were asked if there was any glass on the ground after the traffic accident in the video they had watched. Now, there wasn't any glass on the ground in the video. But if people had received the question with the more violent verb, smashed, then they were much more likely to say, yes, there was glass on the ground than if they had received the question with the more neutral verb, hit. That tiny misleading word affected their entire memory for the event. And this is one reason that investigators have to be so careful when questioning witnesses. Even a seemingly insignificant phrase can impact what people think they recall. One reason false or misleading information can have such a strong impact on memory is that people often have difficulty with something called source monitoring, that's keeping track of where various information came from, the source of the information. So even if they had some confusion over whether they'd seen a yield sign or a stop sign, they might have difficulty remembering if the yield sign was in the original video or the written description. Similarly, people who got the question with smashed instead of hit might have difficulty separating out memories of the video car crash from other car crashes on movies or something where there was glass on the ground afterwards. So you might wonder if some types of memory could be immune to this sneaky effect of misinformation. After all, some memories probably seem really vivid to you. And it's hard to think that they might not be true. And sometimes people think that if a memory is particularly emotional, then it's less susceptible to forgetting and more likely to be accurate. Emotional memories can be positively or negatively valenced. The birth of your child might be very positive. It's a positive emotion, so it's a positive valence. But a memory about the planes hitting the twin towers on September 11, 2001 might be very negatively valenced. Whether positive or negative, highly emotional memories that feel extremely vivid are called flashbulb memories. And even though these memories can seem as real as life, they're just as susceptible to reconstruction as less emotional memories. Now, I don't want you to walk away thinking that everything you remember is a lie. Often these minor reconstructions aren't very drastic. But what you should understand is that memory is not a video recorder. It's the very organic result of neural connections in your brain which can be altered and reformed each time they're exercised.",science_health-and-medicine_executive-systems-of-the-brain
" This problem is from chapter five of the Kotz, Treichel, Townsend Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity textbook. So they tell us, suppose you want to know the enthalpy change-- so the change in total energy-- for the formation of methane, CH4, from solid carbon as a graphite-- that's right there-- and hydrogen gas. So we want to figure out the enthalpy change of this reaction. How do we get methane-- how much energy is absorbed or released when methane is formed from the reaction of-- solid carbon as graphite and hydrogen gas? So they tell us the enthalpy change for this reaction cannot to be measured in the laboratory because the reaction is very slow. So normally, if you could measure it you would have this reaction happening and you'd kind of see how much heat, or what's the temperature change, of the surrounding solution. Maybe this is happening so slow that it's very hard to measure that temperature change, or you can't do it in any meaningful way. We can, however, measure enthalpy changes for the combustion of carbon, hydrogen, and methane. So they're giving us the enthalpy changes for these combustion reactions-- combustion of carbon, combustion of hydrogen, combustion of methane. And they say, use this information to calculate the change in enthalpy for the formation of methane from its elements. So any time you see this kind of situation where they're giving you the enthalpies for a bunch of reactions and they say, hey, we don't know the enthalpy for some other reaction, and that other reaction seems to be made up of similar things, your brain should immediately say, hey, maybe this is a Hess's Law problem. Hess's Law. And all Hess's Law says is that if a reaction is the sum of two or more other reactions, then the change in enthalpy of this reaction is going to be the sum of the change in enthalpies of those reactions. Now, when we look at this, and this tends to be the confusing part, how can you construct this reaction out of these reactions over here? And what I like to do is just start with the end product. So I like to start with the end product, which is methane in a gaseous form. And when we look at all these equations over here we have the combustion of methane. So this actually involves methane, so let's start with this. But this one involves methane and as a reactant, not a product. But what we can do is just flip this arrow and write it as methane as a product. So if we just write this reaction, we flip it. So now we have carbon dioxide gas-- let me write it down here-- carbon dioxide gas plus-- I'll do this in another color-- plus two waters-- if we're thinking of these as moles, or two molecules of water, you could even say-- two molecules of water in its liquid state. That can, I guess you can say, this would not happen spontaneously because it would require energy. But if we just put this in the reverse direction, if you go in this direction you're going to get two waters-- or two oxygens, I should say-- I'll do that in this pink color. So two oxygens-- and that's in its gaseous state-- plus a gaseous methane. CH4. CH4 in a gaseous state. And all I did is I wrote this third equation, but I wrote it in reverse order. I'm going from the reactants to the products. When you go from the products to the reactants it will release 890.3 kilojoules per moles of the reaction going on. But if you go the other way it will need 890 kilojoules. So the delta H here-- I'll do this in the neutral color-- so the delta H of this reaction right here is going to be the reverse of this. So it's positive 890.3 kilojoules per mole of the reaction. All I did is I reversed the order of this reaction right there. The good thing about this is I now have something that at least ends up with what we eventually want to end up with. This is where we want to get. This is where we want to get eventually. Now, if we want to get there eventually, we need to at some point have some carbon dioxide, and we have to have at some point some water to deal with. So how can we get carbon dioxide, and how can we get water? Well, these two reactions right here-- this combustion reaction gives us carbon dioxide, this combustion reaction gives us water. So we can just rewrite those. Let me just rewrite them over here, and I will-- let me use some colors. So if I start with graphite-- carbon in graphite form-- carbon in its graphite form plus-- I already have a color for oxygen-- plus oxygen in its gaseous state, it will produce carbon dioxide in its gaseous form. It will produce carbon-- that's a different shade of green-- it will produce carbon dioxide in its gaseous form. And this reaction, so when you take the enthalpy of the carbon dioxide and from that you subtract the enthalpy of these reactants you get a negative number. Which means this had a lower enthalpy, which means energy was released. Because there's now less energy in the system right here. So this is essentially how much is released. But our change in enthalpy here, our change in enthalpy of this reaction right here, that's reaction one. I'll just rewrite it. Minus 393.5 kilojoules per mole of the reaction occurring. So the reaction occurs a mole times. This would be the amount of energy that's essentially released. This is our change in enthalpy. So if this happens, we'll get our carbon dioxide. Now we also have-- and so we would release this much energy and we'd have this product to deal with-- but we also now need our water. And this reaction right here gives us our water, the combustion of hydrogen. So we have-- and I haven't done hydrogen yet, so let me do hydrogen in a new color. That's not a new color, so let me do blue. So right here you have hydrogen gas-- I'm just rewriting that reaction-- hydrogen gas plus 1/2 O2-- pink is my color for oxygen-- 1/2 O2 gas will yield, will it give us some water. Will give us H2O, will give us some liquid water. Now, before I just write this number down, let's think about whether we have everything we need. To make this reaction occur, because this gets us to our final product, this gets us to the gaseous methane, we need a mole. Or we can even say a molecule of carbon dioxide, and this reaction gives us exactly one molecule of carbon dioxide. So that's a check. And we need two molecules of water. Now, this reaction only gives us one molecule of water. So let's multiply both sides of the equation to get two molecules of water. So this is a 2, we multiply this by 2, so this essentially just disappears. You multiply 1/2 by 2, you just get a 1 there. And then you put a 2 over here. So I just multiplied this second equation by 2. So I just multiplied-- this is becomes a 1, this becomes a 2. And if you're doing twice as much of it, because we multiplied by 2, the delta H now, the change enthalpy of the reaction, is now going to be twice this. Let's get the calculator out. It's now going to be negative 285.8 times 2. Because we just multiplied the whole reaction times 2. So negative 571.6. So it's negative 571.6 kilojoules per mole of the reaction. Now, let's see if the combination, if the sum of these reactions, actually is this reaction up here. And to do that-- actually, let me just copy and paste this top one here because that's kind of the order that we're going to go in. You don't have to, but it just makes it hopefully a little bit easier to understand. So let me just copy and paste this. Actually, I could cut and paste it. Cut and then let me paste it down here. That first one. And let's see now what's going to happen. To see whether the some of these reactions really does end up being this top reaction right here, let's see if we can cancel out reactants and products. Let's see what would happen. So this produces carbon dioxide, but then this mole, or this molecule of carbon dioxide, is then used up in this last reaction. So this produces it, this uses it. So those cancel out. Let me do it in the same color so it's in the screen. This reaction produces it, this reaction uses it. Now, this reaction right here produces the two molecules of water. And now this reaction down here-- I want to do that same color-- these two molecules of water. Now, this reaction down here uses those two molecules of water. Now, this reaction right here, it requires one molecule of molecular oxygen. This one requires another molecule of molecular oxygen. So these two combined are two molecules of molecular oxygen. So those are the reactants. And in the end, those end up as the products of this last reaction. So those, actually, they go into the system and then they leave out the system, or out of the sum of reactions unchanged. So they cancel out with each other. So we could say that and that we cancel out. And so what are we left with? What are we left with in the reaction? Well, we have some solid carbon as graphite plus two moles, or two molecules of molecular hydrogen yielding-- all we have left on the product side is some methane. 1So it is true that the sum of these reactions is exactly 1what we want. 1All we have left on the product side is the graphite, 1the solid graphite, plus the molecular hydrogen, plus the 1gaseous hydrogen-- do it in that color-- plus 1two hydrogen gas. 1And all we have left on the product side is the methane. 1All we have left is the methane in the gaseous form. 1So it is true that the sum of these reactions-- remember, we 1have to flip this reaction around and change its sign, 1and we have to multiply this reaction by 2 so that the sum 1of these becomes this reaction that we really care about. 1So this is the sum of these reactions. 1Its change in enthalpy of this reaction is going to be the 1sum of these right here. 1That is Hess's Law. 1So this is the fun part. 1So we just add up these values right here. 1So we have negative 393.-- no, that's not 1what I wanted to do. 1Let me just clear it. 1So I have negative 393.5, so that step is exothermic. 1And then we have minus 571.6. 1That is also exothermic. 1Those were both combustion reactions, which are, as we 1know, very exothermic. 1And we have the endothermic step, the reverse of that last 1combustion reaction. 1So plus 890.3 gives us negative 74.8. 1It gives us negative 74.8 kilojoules for every mole of 1the reaction occurring. 1Or if the reaction occurs, a mole time. 1So there you go. 1We figured out the change in enthalpy. 1And it is reasonably exothermic. 1Nowhere near as exothermic as these combustion reactions 1right here, but it is going to release energy. 1And we're done.",science_chemistry_thermodynamics-chemistry
" -  Each small square on the grid has an area of one square unit. So, each of these small squares is one square unit. This square is one square unit, and this square is one square unit, and so on.

So, our shape in this case is a rectangle, so we're being asked to draw a rectangle that covers 10 square units, and we know that each of these is one square unit, so we want a rectangle that covers 10 of the square units. We could try just drawing a rectangle right across this top row until we get 10 square units, but the problem there is there's only one, two, three, four, five, six, seven square units going across the top. So we can't just do one long row of 10 square units. We can't do one long column either, because one, two, three, four, five, six. Only six square units, so we can't draw a rectangle going down like that either because we need 10 square units. So that means we're gonna have to break up our 10 into equal groups. Since it can't all fit on one row, we're gonna have to break up the unit squares into groups. So, we can break up a 10 into two groups of five, or five groups of two. Either one of those will work. So let's do that. Let's draw ourselves a rectangle, and we'll start up here. Here's a rectangle. And let's see, that's five. And we can space and make sure that covers the whole square unit. There we go. So here's our rectangle, and this rectangle covers one, two, three, four, five, there's the first row of five. And the second row of five has unit squares six, seven, eight, nine, and ten. So, here's one perfect answer, a rectangle that has two rows of five square units, and we could've drawn this rectangle anywhere on the grid. It doesn't matter. We could've drawn it down here with two rows of five, or right here with two rows of five. Any rectangle covering two rows of five has an area of 10 unit squares. Similarly, any rectangle covering five rows of two, let's look and see if we can try to show that. Here we go. Here's a rectangle. And this one will cover one, two, so we have rows of two, and there's five rows. So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. So again, this rectangle covers 10 square units. So any rectangle you can draw on the grid that either covers two rows of five square units or five rows of two square units is a rectangle with an area of 10 square units.",math_in-in-class-6-math-india-icse_in-in-6-perimeter-and-area-icse
" I'm going to draw a person for you, and this is going to be my side profile of this person. Let's say something like this. And this person has-- I'm going to draw it kind of loosely-- let's say, two arms and one shoulder apparently. I need to draw in another shoulder. There we go. So this is my person. And I'm going to draw in their brain. This is their brain. And they have a heart. This is their heart here. And now you know there are nerves that come down from the brain and serve the heart, right? So these are nerves that are basically going to tell the heart to speed up or beat harder, with higher force of contraction, or maybe relax more quickly. So basically what I'm telling you, these are the sympathetic nerves. And of course, I should also draw in the parasympathetic nerves. So these are going to tell the heart to slow down and also going to increase the delay in the AV node. And these are the parasympathetic nerves, primarily the vagus nerve. You might hear that word too, vagus nerves, which is basically the actual name of the nerve itself. But they are parasympathetic nerves. Now, you have information flowing from the brain down to the heart. But you also have information flowing from the heart up to the brain. So, information is going up as well as down. So what would be an example of information going up? Well, you can imagine that there might be volume receptors, right? So we know that the brain needs to know about the volume status. And in the right atrium, there are some volume receptors that basically stretch. And once they stretch, they tell the brain that there's a lot of blood. Or if they're not stretched, they tell the brain that there's not a lot of blood. And this really helps with autoregulation of blood pressure. So if you want to regulate your blood pressure, you've got to have some information. So autoregulation of blood pressure. So basically, the whole point of me saying all this is that there's a lot of nerves going back and forth between the brain and the heart. Now, let's say this person that I'm describing tragically dies. They die. And they're wish was to donate their heart. And so, over here we have a heart recipient, someone that is interested in getting a heart. Let's say that their heart is not working well or whatever the situation may be. They're actually hoping to get a heart. So this person is looking for a heart, and this person died and their wish was to give a heart. So, let's show that actually. Let's show the heart moving over. Let's say that this person's heart gets sent over to the person on the right. So now their heart gets sent over here. So all is well. And this person's actually obviously very happy that they got a heart. This is obviously a big deal. Let's see if we can do this. There we go. This person's going to be smiling, right? And I should probably erase all these little nerves. But this brings up a really good point, because if the nerves are not coming over-- which they're not, it's just the heart-- then can we regulate all the things that we know that nerves help us regulate? Can we, for example, tweak or change the heart rate if needed? Or can we change the force of contraction if needed? Are any of those things going to be able to be changed, or is this heart basically now always going to be in one status, always just beating at one rate, pumping it with one force, is it ever going to change? Is there any way anything can change this now that the nerves are not connected? Well, the first thing is that there is some evidence that nerves can reconnect from the new body. But that would take a long, long time. So in the short term, what is the answer? Well, you have a couple of glands. You have adrenal glands sitting here. And these glands are sitting literally above the kidneys. So these are the adrenal glands. And you also have thyroid gland. So these are the adrenal glands and this is your thyroid up here. This is your thyroid kind of in your neck region. So these are hormone producers. The thyroid gland, the adrenal glands, they're going to be producing hormones. And those hormones can affect the heart. So, one hormone could be, for example, this would be a thyroid hormone. Down below, you might have epinephrine. So another hormone, number two could be epinephrine. This comes from the adrenals. So you can see that basically there are hormones that are going to affect the heart. Over here in the first case, when the heart was over here, you're getting rapid changes, right? Very, very quick. But as compared to what we were getting, this is going to be a little bit slower in terms of the response rate, because now the hormone has to go through the bloodstream and get to the heart. And it takes a little bit of time. Whereas before with the nerves, you're really getting changes as fast as a nerve impulse, which is on the order of less than a second. So definitely the response rate is going to be slower. So your heart can change its force of contraction and heart rate and conduction velocity. It definitely can change in this new person with a heart transplant. But it will take a little bit longer. And another thing that will change it, in addition to just hormones, I want to remind you, is medication. So let's imagine this person is taking medications. And let's say these medications have certain properties. Let's say they're taking a calcium channel blocker. Let's say they're taking a medicine that's a-- I should probably write meds here-- calcium channel blocker. Well, you know that there are calcium channels in the heart. And if you are blocking them, then that's going to have an effect on the force of contraction, let's say. And what if they're taking a beta blocker? And beta refers to the receptor for epinephrine and norepinephrine. So if they're taking a beta blocker, they're really blocking the effects of, in this case, epinephrine, right? They're blocking epinephrine effects. So you can see how if the person starts taking a medication or let's say they take a few pills on a certain day, or their adrenal glands are making more epinephrine, all these kinds of things are going to essentially change how the heart works, how fast it's working, how hard it's working. So they are going to have changes. It's not like they don't have changes in any of those things. But those changes are going to take place on a slower time scale than what would have happened in the person who has all the nerves connected.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system
" I'm now going to show you what I think are probably the two coolest derivatives in all of calculus. And I'll reserve that. None of the other ones have occurred to me right now. But these are definitely to me some of the neatest. So let's figure out what the derivative of the natural log is. And just as a review, what is the natural log? Well the natural log of something is the exact same thing as saying logarithm base e of that something. That's just a review. So let's take the derivative of this. I think I'm going to need a lot of space for this. I'm going to try to do it as neatly as possible. So the derivative of the natural log of x equals-- well let's just take the definition of a derivative, right? We just take the slope at some point and find the limit as we take the difference between the two points to 0. So let's take the limit as delta x approaches 0 of f of x plus delta x. So I'm going to take the limit of this whole thing. The natural log ln of x plus delta x-- right, that's like one point that I'm going to take evaluate the function-- minus the ln of x. All of that over delta x. And if you remember from the derivative videos, this is just the slope, and I'm just taking the limit as I find the slope between a smaller and a smaller distance. Hopefully you remember that. So let's see if we can do some logarithm properties to simplify this a little bit. Hopefully you remember-- and if you don't, review the logarithm properties-- but remember that log of a minus log of b is equal to log of a over b, and that comes out of the fact that logarithm expressions are essentially exponents, so they follow the exponent rules. And if that doesn't make sense to you, you should review those as well. But let's apply this logarithm property to this equation. So let me rewrite the whole thing, and I'm going to keep switching colors to keep it from getting monotonous. So we have the limit as delta x approaches 0 of this big thing. Let's see. So log of a minus b equals log a over b, so this top, the numerator, will equal the natural log of x plus delta x over x. Right? a b a/b, all of that over delta x. And so that equals the limit as delta x approaches 0-- I think it's time to switch colors again-- delta x approaches 0 of-- well let me just write this 1 over delta x out in front. So this is 1 over delta x, and we're going to take the limit of everything. ln x divided by x is 1 plus delta x over x. Fair enough. Now I'm going to throw out another logarithm property, and hopefully you remember that-- and let me put the properties separate so you know it's not part of the proof-- that a log b is equal to log of b to the a. And that comes from when you take something to an exponent, and then to another exponent you just have to multiply those two exponents. I don't want to confuse you, but hopefully you should remember this. So how does apply here? Well this would be a log b. So this expression is the same thing as the limit. The limit as delta x approaches 0 of the natural log of 1 plus delta x over x to the 1 over delta x power. And remember all this is the natural log of this entire thing. And then we're going to take the limit as delta x approaches 0. If you've watched the compound interest problems and you know the definition of e, I think this will start to look familiar. But let me make a substitution that might clean things up a little bit. Let me make the substitution, let me call it n-- no, no, no, let me call u-- is equal to delta x over x. And then if that's true then we can multiply both sides by x and we get xu is equal to delta x. Or we would also know that 1 over delta x is equal to 1 over xu. These are all equivalent. So let's make the substitution. So if we're taking the limit is delta x approaches 0, in this expression if delta x approaches 0, what does u approach? u approaches 0. So delta x approaching 0 is the same exact thing as taking the limit as u approaches 0. So we can write this as the limit as u approaches 0 of the natural log of 1 plus-- well we did the substitution, delta x over x is now u-- to the 1 over delta x, and that same substitution told us that's the same thing as one over xu. Remember we're taking the natural log of everything. And we know this is an exponent property, which I'll now do in a different color. We know that a to the bc is equal to a to the b to the c power. So that tells us that this me is equal to the limit as u approaches 0 of the natural log of 1 plus u to the 1/u, because this is one over xu, right? 1/u, and then all of that to the 1/x. And how did I do that? Just from this exponent property, right? If I were to simplify this, I would have 1/x times 1/u, and that's where I get this 1 over xu. Well then we can just do this logarithm property in reverse. If I have b to the a I can put that a out front. So I could take this 1/x and put it in front of the natural log. So now what do I have? We're almost there. We have the limit as u approaches 0. Take that 1/x, put it in front of the natural log sign. 1/x times the natural log of 1 plus u to the 1/u. Fair enough. When we're taking the limit as u approaches 0, x, this term doesn't involve it at all. So we could take this out in front, because the limit doesn't affect this term. And then we're essentially saying what happens to this expression as the limit as u approaches 0. So this thing is equivalent to 1/x times the natural log of the limit as u approaches 0 of 1 plus u to the 1/u. And by now hopefully you would recognize that this is the definition. This limit comes to e, if you remember anything from compound interest. You might remember it as the limit-- as n approaches infinity of 1 plus 1 over n to the n. But these things are equivalent. If you just took the substitution u is equal to 1/n, you would get this. You would just get this. So this expression right here is e That expression is e. So we're getting close. So this whole thing is equivalent to 1/x times the natural log, and this we know, this is one of the ways to get to e. So the limit as u approaches 0 of 1 plus u to the 1/u. That is e. And what is the natural log? Well it's the log base e. So you know this is equal to 1/x times the log base e of e. So that's saying e to what power is e. Well e to the first power is e, right? This is equal to 1. So 1 times 1/x is equal to 1/x. There we have it. The derivative of the natural log of x is equal to 1/x, which I find kind of neat, because all of the other exponents lead to another exponent. But all of a sudden in the mix here you have the natural log and the derivative of that is equal to x to the negative 1 or 1/x.

" The graph below contains the rectangle ABCP. Draw the image of ABCP under a dilation whose center is at P and a scale factor is 1 and 2/3. What are the lengths of the side AB and its image? So we're going to do a dilation centered at P. So if we're centering a dilation at P and its scale factor is 1 and 2/3, that means once we perform the dilation, every point is going to be 1 and 2/3 times as far away from P. Well P is 0 away from P, so its image is still going to be at P. So let's put that point right over there. Now point C is going to be 1 and 2/3 times as far as it is right now. So let's see, right now it is 6 away. It's at negative 3. And P, its x-coordinate is the same, but in the y direction, P is at 3. C is at negative 3. So it's 6 less. We want to be 1 and 2/3 times as far away. So what's 1 and 2/3 of 6? Well, 2/3 of 6 is 4, so it's going to be 6 plus 4. You're going to be 10 away. So 3 minus 10, that gets us to negative 7. So that gets us right over there. Now point A, right now it is 3 more in the horizontal direction than point P's x-coordinate. So we want to go 1 and 2/3 as far. So what is 1 and 2/3 times 3? Well that's going to be 3 plus 2/3 of 3, which is another 2. So that's going to be 5. So we're going to get right over there. Then we could complete the rectangle. And notice point B is now 1 and 2/3 times as far in the horizontal direction. It was 3 away in the horizontal direction, now it is 5 away from P's x-coordinate. And in the vertical direction, in the y direction, it was 6 below P's y-coordinate. Now it is 1 and 2/3 times as far. It is 10 below P's y-coordinate. So then let's answer these questions. The length of segment AB-- well, we already saw that. That is, we're going from 3 to negative 3. That is 6 units long. And its image, well it's 1 and 2/3 as long. We see it over here. We're going from 3 to negative 7. 3 minus negative 7 is 10. It is 10 units long. We got it right.",math_geometry_hs-geo-transformations
" -  The function F is defined over the real numbers. This table gives select values of F. We have our table here. For these X values, it gives the corresponding F of X. What is a reasonable estimate for the limit of F of X as X approaches one from the left? So pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. Alright, now let's work through this together. So the first thing that is really important to realize is when you see this X approaches one and you see this little negative superscript here, this does not mean approaching negative one, so this does not mean negative one. Sometimes your brain just sees a one and that little negative sign there, and you're like oh, this must be a weird way of writing negative one, or you don't even think about it, but it's not saying that. It's saying, this is saying, let me put a little arrow here, this is the limit of F of X as X approaches one from the left, from the left. So from the left, how do we know that? Well that's what that little negative tells us. It tells us we're approaching one from values less than one. If we were approaching one from the right, from values greater than one, that would be a positive sign right over there. So let's think about it. We want the limit as X approaches one from the left, and lucky for us on this table, we have some values of X approaching one from the left. 0.9, which is already pretty close to one, then we get even closer to one from the left. Notice, these are all less than one, but they're getting closer and closer to one. And so what we really wanna look at is what does F of X approach as X is getting closer and closer to one, from the left, from the left. And a key realization here is, if we're thinking about general limits, not just from one direction, then we might wanna look at from the left and from the right, but they're asking us only from the left, so we should only be looking at these values right over here. In fact, we shouldn't even let the value of F of X at X equal one confuse us. Sometimes and oftentimes, the limit is approaching a different value than the value of the function at that point. So let's look at this. At 0.9, F of X is 2.5. When we get even closer to one from the left, we go to 2.1. When we get even closer to one from the left, we're getting even closer to two. So a reasonable estimate for the limit as X approaches one from the left of F of X, it looks like F of X right over here is approaching two. We don't know for sure, that's why they're saying, what is a reasonable estimate. It might be approaching 2.01 or it might be approaching 1.999. On Khan Academy these will often be multiple choice questions, so you have to pick the most reasonable one, it would not be fair if they gave a 1.999 as a choice and 2.01, but if you were saying, hey, maybe this was approaching a whole number, then two could be a reasonable estimate right over here. Although it doesn't have to be two, it could be 2.01258, it might be what it is actually approaching. So let's try another example here. Here it does look like there's a reasonable estimate for the limit as we approach this value from the left. So now, it says the function F is defined over the real numbers. This table gives select values of F, similar to the last question. What is a reasonable estimate for the limit as X approaches negative two from the left? So this is confusing. You see these two negative signs. This first negative sign tells us we're approaching negative two. We wanna say, what happens we're approaching negative two, and we're gonna approach once again from the left. So lucky for us, they have values of X that are approaching negative two from the left, so this is X approaches negative two from the left, so that is happening right over here. So that's these values. So notice, this is negative 2.05, then we get even closer, negative 2.01, then we get even closer, negative 2.002, and these are from the left because these are values less than negative two, but they're getting closer and closer to negative two. And so let's see, when we're a little bit further, F of X is negative 20, we get a little bit closer, it's negative 100, we get even a little bit closer, it goes to negative 500. So it would be reasonable, and we don't know for sure, this is just giving us a few sample points for this function, but if we follow this trend, as we get closer and closer to negative two, without getting there, it looks like this is getting unbounded. It looks like it's becoming infinitely negative. And so technically, it looks like this is, I would write this is unbounded, and so if this was a multiple choice question, technically you would say the limit as X approaches negative two from the left does not exist, does not exist. If someone asked the other question, if they said, what is the limit as X approaches negative two from the right of F of X, well then you would say, alright, well here are values approaching negative two from the right, so this is X approaching negative two from the right, right over here. And remember, when you're looking at a limit, sometimes it might be distracting to look at the actual value of the function at that point, so we wanna think about what is the value of the function approaching, as your X is approaching that value, as X is approaching, in this case, negative two, from the right. So as we're getting closer and closer to negative two from values larger than negative two, it looks like F of X is getting closer and closer to negative four, which is F of negative two, but that actually seems like a reasonable estimate. Once again, we don't know absolutely for sure, just by sampling some points, but this would be a reasonable estimate. And in general, if you are approaching different values from the left than from the right, then you would say, a that point, the limit of your function does not exist, and we have seen that in other videos.",math_ap-calculus-ab_ab-limits-new
" In this video I'm going to talk a little more about points on angle bisector but before that I want to at least make sure we understand what we mean when we talk about the distance between a point and a line. So say that that is some point, point A this is some line right over here, we'll call that line, BC, so when you're taking the distance between a point and another point, it's very obvious, you just draw a line to that other point, Well I already used B, you just draw a line to that other point and you find the length of that line, so distance seems very straight foreward between two points, but what about a point and a line because there are many points on this line maybe were going to find this distance, or maybe were going to find this distance, or this distance, and these are all going to be different lengths so how do we have one unique distance? And the way that we think about this, and we're going to do this in much more depth in future math courses especially when you start vectors and linear algebra and all the rest, is distance between a point and a line is really the shortest distance and that shortest distance is as if you were to drop a perpendicular from that point to the line, so this right over here, this right over here, is what we call the distance the distance between the point and the line, and this is perpendicular right over here, to recognize that this is indeed the shortest distance think about this relative -the distance between this point and any other point on this line. so pick another point on this line right over here, let's call this point E, and think about this --now this is an arbitrary point I could have drawn E here, I could have drawn E here, I could have drawn E anywhere, but regardless of where you draw E, if you draw a line segment between A and E, you see that we've form a right triangle from A to E, to the point we had the perpendicular, so let me call this point right here F, you're always going to draw a right triangle assuming that E is different than F and if you will immediately see that you see that D has to be shorter than this orange length, because this orange length is the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is always going to be the longest side a triangle D squared plus whatever length this squared, is going to be equal to this length squared. So hopefully that at least gives you a decent sense why dropping the perpendicular will always give you the shortest distance between a point and a line, and that unique shortest distance is what we call the distance between a point and a line. Now with that out of the way, let's think a little bit about angle bisectors. So let me draw an angle here, so let me, draw an angle. So lets call this point, let me do it in a different color, let's call that point A, lets call this point B, and let's call this point C right over here. And an angle bisector is essentially line, or a segment, or a ray that splits an angle into two equal angles and we've talked about this before, so for example if we want to bisect angle ABC, so this angle right over here, we want to split it in two, we are going to -I can draw a better version of that, we want to split it in two, we want to split it in two like, let me draw a little bit better, my drawing still doesn't look like, that looks decent, alright, so lets call this point right over here D, and again we could even say that, that's a ray, or we could call that a segment, or whatever, but the way to think about this, is if now angle DBC is equal to angle DBA, so this angle, DBC is equal to angle DBA, we can say that DB bisects angle ABC, so we can say that DB and now Im talking about segment DB we could have made it a ray if we had -keep going to the right, or a line. DB bisects BISECTS angle ABC, ABC Fare enough, now, the whole reason why I started this video talking about distances between points and lines, is that I want to show you, that any point that is on an angle bisector, is actually going to be equidistant from the sides of the angle, and then were going to go the other way saying, any point that is equidistant from the sides of an angle is going on the angle bisector. So lets take an arbitrary point that sits on this angle bisector so let's take this point right over here, Ill call that arbitrary point F, or actually I havnt used E yet, so this is going to be and arbitrary point on our angle bisector, and now let's look at the distance between E and BC and the distance between E and BA we already say that, -we already said that the distance between point and a line is if you drop a perpendicular from a point to that line, which you can always do so lets draw a perpendicular right over here, this is one distance, and then this is the other distance this is, -this orange line right here is the distance between E and BC and this orange line is the distance between E and BA and what I want to prove is that these distances are equal well the first thing to realize, is that we have two right triangles over here, they both share th- they both have the same angle, they're not sharing it but angle ABE is congruent to angle CBE and we know that because DB bisects it so this angle is equal to that angle they're both right triangles so the actually have 2 angles in common, which actually means they actually have 3 angles in common and constrains what this other angle would be and they also have this side in common, -they have 3 angles are congruent to each other, they are not necessarily in common, but it does have this side in common, BE is the hypotenuse of both of these right triangles, and so, you can invoke using this angle, that angle and this side, this angle,that angle and this side you could say that these 2 triangles are going to be congruent to each other so we could say that triangle, and let me put some points over here, so let's see let's call this F and let's call this G, we can say that triangle EBF is congruent to triangle EBG and we can use AAS, by Angle Angle Side congruency or you could say hey if two angles, -if corresponding angles are the same then the third angle is also going to be the same so this angle right over here could also be the same and you could use ASA, but either way these two things are going to be congruent but if these two things are congruent, then the corresponding sides are going to be congruent so then, then length of EF, segment EF, is going to be congruent to segment EF is going to be congruent to segment EG which is the same thing as the length of EF is equal to the length of EG, these are really, these are really equivalent statements right over there, so the length of EF, the length of EF is equal to the length of EG and the length of those two segments are the distances between the point and those 2 respective sides. We've just proven the first case, if a point lies on an angle bisector, it is equidistant from the 2 sides of the angle, now let's go the other way around, let's say that I have, so let me draw another angle here, so let me draw another angle over here and let's call this A, B, and C and let's pick some arbitrary point E, let's point some arbitrary point E right over here and let's say we start off with the assumption that E is equidistant to BC and BA and what we want to do is prove that E must be on the angle bisector, so here, if you're on the angle bisector you're equidistant, over here we're going to show if you're equidistant you're on the angle bisector, so if it's equidistant to BC and BA, then this perpendicular right over here, this perpendicular right over here, is going to be congruent to this perpendicular right over there, and let me give these points' labels, so let call this point D, and let's call this point right over F, and let's just draw segment BE here, let's just draw segment BE right over here, so once again, we have 2 right triangles, we already know that 2 of the legs are congruent to each other, they both share the hypotenuse this hypotenuse is equal to its self, we know from the pythagorean theorm if you know 2 sides of a triangle, it determines the third side, so and we know 2 sides of both of these, so the third sides must be the same, so this side must be equal to that side so you could invoke SSS, Side Side Side, to show these 2 triangles are congruent or you actually didn't need to -have to good there you could have used a special case, the RSH case, where if you have a right triangle, so if you have the right triangle you have one set of sides that are congruent, and you have the hypotenuse that is congruent then you're also okay, you could use RSH to prove congruency as well, and so either way we know that triangle EBD, triangle EBD, is congruent to triangle EBF congruent to triangle EBF, we used Side Side Side here but you could have used RSH, let me write that RSH, which is -we know that Angle Side Side can be used for any general triangle but it can be, -RSH is essentially Angle Side Side for right triangles, if you have 2 sides of a right triangle and- in common, --if 2 sides of a right triangle are congruent then the 2 triangles are definitely congruent but once you know that two triangles are congruent, then they're corresponding angles have to be congruent, and angle EBD, angle EBD 1corresponds to angle EBF so we know that angle EBD must be congruent to angle EBF 1so EBD must be congruent to EBF, well if EBD is congruent to EBF then that means 1that segment EB must bisect, must bisect angle CBF, or actually CBA even, it could be called CEF 1angle CBA. So we're done! If over here, we show that if something sits on a bisector is 1equidistant from the sides of the angle, and here we showed if it's equidistant from the sides 1of the angle it sits on the angle bisector, or, or -it could even be the end point of an angle bisector 1but clearly, it sits on it.",math_geometry-home_triangle-properties
" Problem 1. For 0 is less than or equal to t is less than or equal to 6, a particle is moving along the x-axis. The particle's position x of t is not explicitly given. The velocity of the particle is given by v of t is equal to all of this business right over here. The acceleration of the particle is given by a of t is equal to all of this business over here. They actually didn't have to give us that because the acceleration is just the derivative of the velocity. And they also gave us-- they don't tell us the position function, but they tell us where we start off, x of 0 is equal to 2. Fair enough. Now let's do part A. Is the speed of the particle increasing or decreasing at time t equals 5.5? Give a reason for your answer. It looks like they did something a little sneaky here because they gave us a velocity function and then they ask about a speed. And you might say, wait, aren't those the same thing? And I would say, no, they aren't quite the same thing. Velocity is a magnitude and a direction. It is a vector quantity. Speed is just a magnitude. It is a scalar quantity. And to see the difference, you could have a velocity-- and this isn't maybe particular to this problem because they don't give us the units-- but you could have a velocity of negative 5 meters per second. And maybe if we're talking about on the x-axis, this would mean we're moving leftward at 5 meters per second on the x-axis. So the magnitude is 5 meters per second. This is the magnitude. And the direction is specified by the negative number. And that is the direction. Your velocity could be negative 5 meters per second, but your speed would just be 5 meters per second. So your speed is 5 meters per second whether you're going to the left or to the right. Your velocity, you actually care whether you're going to the left or the right. So let's just keep that in mind while we try to solve this problem. So the best way to figure out whether our rate of change is increasing or decreasing is to look at the acceleration. Because acceleration is really just the rate of change of velocity. And then, we can think a little bit about this velocity versus speed question. So what is the acceleration at time 5.5? Get the calculator out. We can use calculators for this part of the AP exam. And I assume they intend us to because this isn't something that's easy to calculate by hand. So the acceleration at time 5.5, we just have to say t is 5.5 and evaluate this function. So 1/2-- I'll just write 0.5-- times e to the t over 4. Well t is 5.5. 5.5 divided by 4. And then, times cosine of 5.5 divided by 4 gives us 0.38. Did I do that right? We have 0.5 times e to the 5.5 divided by 4, times cosine-- oh, sorry. I made a mistake. That looked a little strange. It's not cosine of 5.5 divided by 4, it's cosine of e to the 5.5 divided by 4. So let's look at that. So that's one parentheses I close. And now that is the second parentheses that I've closed. And I get negative 1.3-- well, I just say roughly negative 1.36. So this is equal to, or approximately equal to, negative 1.36 if I round it. And we don't care about so much as the actual value. What we really care about is its sign. So the acceleration at time 5.5 is negative, which tells us that the velocity is decreasing. Now, you might be tempted to say, we're done. But remember, they're not asking us, is the velocity of the particle increasing or decreasing? They're asking us, is the speed of the particle increasing or decreasing? And if you're saying, hey, how did I know that, just remember acceleration is just the rate of change of velocity. If acceleration is negative, that means the rate of change of velocity is negative It is going down. But anyway, how do we address this speed issue? How do we think about it? Well, there's two scenarios. If our velocity is positive at time 5.5, so if we have a positive velocity, so let's say our velocity is 5 meters per second-- although they don't give us units here, so I won't use units. So let's say our velocity is 5. And then it's negative. So at some point our velocity is going to be something smaller. Then that means that the speed would also be decreasing. So if we have a positive velocity, then the fact that acceleration is negative means that both velocity and speed would be decreasing. On the other hand, if we had a negative velocity at time t equals 5.5, then the fact that it's decreasing means that we're getting even more negative. And if we're getting even more negative, then that means the speed is increasing. The magnitude is increasing in the leftward direction. So what we really need to do, beyond just evaluating the acceleration at time 5.5, we also have to evaluate the velocity to see if it's going in the left or the rightward direction. So let's evaluate the velocity. The velocity at 5.5-- and we'll just get our calculator out again. Velocity at 5.5-- this is our velocity function-- is going to be equal to 2 times the sine of-- let me write it this way. Just because I want to make sure I get my parentheses right. 2 times the sine-- let me write it this way-- 2 sine of e to the 5.5, that's our time, divided by 4. So I did that part right over here. And I'm going to close the 2 as well. And then plus 1. So this is our velocity. So our velocity at time 5.5 is negative. So negative 0.45. Negative 0.45 roughly. So this is negative. The velocity is negative. So we have this scenario where the velocity is negative, which means we're going in the left direction. And the fact that the velocity is also decreasing means that over time-- at least at this point in time-- as we go forward in time, it'll become even more negative. And it'll become even more negative if we wait a little bit longer. So that means that the magnitude of the velocity is increasing. It's just going in the leftward direction. So if the magnitude of the velocity is increasing although it's going in the leftward direction, that means that the speed is increasing. So the velocity-- so this is one of those interesting scenarios-- the velocity is decreasing. But the speed, which is what they're asking us in the question, speed is increasing. And if you wanted to do it really quick with all of this explanation I gave you, you would say, hey, look. What's acceleration? Is it positive or negative? You would evaluate it. You'd say, hey, it's negative. So you know velocity is decreasing. And then you would say, hey, what is velocity? Is it positive or negative? You evaluate it. You say it's negative. So you have a negative value that is decreasing. So it's becoming more negative. So that means its magnitude is increasing, or speed is increasing.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-solved-exams
" Ok, roll it. You know what this is? It is the longest word in the world. Like, anywhere, any language, more than 189 thousand letters. If you were to write it down, though I don't know why you would, it'd fill up more than a hundred pages! And if you could actually say it without breaking your face, it'd take about five hours! So what the frick is this word? It's the name of the longest known protein on earth. And it's actually in you right now. Because of its enormous size, it was given the nickname Titin by scientists. And that's with two I's. It's a protein that helps give some of the springiness to your muscles. Today we're going to be talking about DNA and how it, along with three versions of its cousin RNA, unleash chemical kung fu to synthesize proteins just like this. This is going to take a while to explain, so how about if we make ourselves some Hot Pockets. (upbeat music) Mmmm, my favorite. Ham and cheese. Every time I take a bite I wonder, how do they do it? How do they pack exactly the same flavor into every foil-cardboard wrapped food-ish item? Clearly there has got to be some super secret instruction manual kept in a location known to only two people. And since I'm talking about biology here, that brings up a related question: How did I get built from the DNA instructions and biological molecules we've been talking about? Today, that's what I'm going to do. Not actually make Hot Pockets, or a person. But I'm going to be talking about DNA transcription and translation, which is how we get made into the delicious things we are today. Though hopefully none of us know how delicious people are. Animals, plants, and also Hot Pockets, really, are nothing more than salty water, carbohydrates, fats, and protein, combined in precise proportions following very explicit instructions. Let's say I want to make my own Hot Pocket. I would have to: one, break into the lair of the Hot Pocket Company holding the secret manual. Two, read the instructions on how to make the machinery to produce the Hot Pocket and the proportions of the ingredients. Three, quickly write down that information in shorthand before I get caught by the Hot Pocket police. Four, go home, follow the instructions to build the machinery and mix the ingredients together until I have a perfect Hot Pocket. That's how we get us. Very simply, inside the cell's nucleus, the DNA instruction manual is copied gene by gene by transcription onto a kind of RNA, then taken out of the lair where the instructions are followed, by the process of translation to assemble amino acid strings into polypeptides or proteins that make up all kinds of stuff from this titin down here to the keratin in my hair. But most of the polypeptides that get made aren't structural proteins like hair, they're enzymes which go on to act like the assembly machinery, breaking down and building and combining carbohydrates and lipids and proteins that make up variations of cell material. So enzymes are just like whatever ingenious machinery they use at the factory to make this. Okay, let's start out in the lair-- I mean the nucleus. The length of DNA that we're going to be transcribing onto an RNA molecule is called our transcription unit. Let's say, in today's example, that it's going to include the gene that transcribes for our friend titin which, in humans at least, occurs on Chromosome 2. Now each transcription unit has a sequence just above it in the strand and that's called ""upstream"", biologists call that ""upstream"" on the strand. And that sequence sort of defines when the transcription unit is going to begin. This special sequence is the promoter, and it almost always contains a sequence of two of the four nitrogenous bases that we talked about in our last episode: adenine, thymine cytosine, and guanine. Specifically, the promoter is a really simple repetition we've got thymine, adenine, thymine, adenine, and then A-A-A. And on the other side: AT-- 'Cause you know how this works, right!? This is called the TATA box. It's nearly universal and helps our enzyme figure out where to bind to the strand. Now, you'll remember from our episode about DNA structure that DNA strands run in one of two directions depending on which end of the strand is free and which end has a phosphate bond. One direction is five prime to three prime, and the other is three prime to five prime. In this case, upstream means toward the three prime end and downstream means toward five prime. So the first enzyme in this process is RNA polymerase, and it copies the DNA sequence downstream of the TATA box, that's towards the five prime end, and copies it into a similar type of language: messenger RNA. Quick aside: so you'll notice that to read the DNA in order to make enzymes we need an enzyme in the first place. So it kind of gets chicken-egg here. We need the enzyme to make the DNA and the DNA to make the enzyme. So, where did RNA polymerase come from in the first place if we haven't made it yet!? What an excellent question! It turns out all of these basic necessities get handed down from your Mom. She packed quite a bit more into her egg than just her DNA so we had a healthy start. So, thanks Mom! So the RNA polymerase binds to the DNA at that TATA box, and begins to unzip the double-helix. Working along the DNA chain, the enzyme reads the nitrogenous bases, those are the letters, and helps the RNA version of the nitrogenous bases floating around in the nucleus to find their match. Now as you also might recall from our previous episodes, nitrogenous bases only have one counterpart that they can bond with. But RNA, which is the pink one here, doesn't have thymine like DNA does, which is the green and the blue. Instead it has uracil, so U appears here in T's place as the partner to adenine. As it moves, the RNA polymerase re-zips the DNA behind it and lets our new strand of messenger RNA peel away. Eventually, the RNA polymerase reaches another sequence downstream, called a termination signal, that triggers it to pull off. Now, some finishing touches before this info can safely leave the lair. First, a special type of guanine is added to the five prime end, that's the first part of the mRNA we copied, and this is called the five prime cap. On the other end, it looks like I fell asleep with my finger on the A key of my keyboard, but another enzyme added about 250 adenines on the three prime end. This is called our poly-A tail. These caps on either end of the RNA package make it easier for the mRNA to leave the nucleus and they also help protect it from degradation from passing enzymes, while also making it easier to connect with other organelles later on. But that's still not the end of it. As if to try to confuse me to protect the secret Hot Pocket recipe, the original recipe book also contains lots of extra, misleading information. So just before leaving the nucleus, that extra information gets cut out of the RNA in a process called RNA splicing. And it's something like editing this video. The process is really complicated, but I just had to tell you about two of the key players because they have such cool names. One, the Snurps, which are Small Nuclear RibonucleoProteins. These are a combination of RNA and proteins, and they recognize the sequences that signal the start and end of the areas to be spliced. Snurps bunch together with a bunch of other proteins to form the spliceosome, which is what does the actual editing as it were, breaking the junk segments down so their nitrogenous bases can be reused in DNA or RNA, and sticking together the two ends of the good stuff. The good stuff that gets spliced together, by the way, are called exons because they'll eventually be expressed, the junk that gets cut out are just intervening segments, or introns. The material in the introns will stay in the nucleus and get recycled. So for instance, titin down there is thought to have hundreds of exons when it's all said and done, probably more than 360, which may be more than any other protein. And it also contains the longest intron in humans, some 17 thousand base pairs long. Man, titin! It is just a world record holder! So now that it has been protected and refined, the messenger RNA can now move out of the nucleus. OK, a quick review of our Hot Pocket Mission Impossible caper so far: We broke into the lair containing the instructions, we copied down those instructions in shorthand, we added some protective coatings, and then we cut out some extra notes that we didn't need, and then we escaped back out of the lair. Now I have to actually read the notes, make the machinery and assemble the ingredients. This process is called translation. So next, rewind your memory, or just watch that video again, to the episode about animal cells. Do you remember the rough endoplasmic reticulum? I hope you do. Those little dots on the membranes are the ribosomes, and the processed messenger RNA gets fed into a ribosome like a dollar bill into a vending machine. Ribosomes are a mixture of protein and a second kind of RNA, called ribosomal RNA, or rRNA, and they act together as a sort of work space. rRNA doesn't contribute any genetic information to the process, instead it has binding sites that allow the incoming mRNA to interact with another special type of RNA, the third in this caper, called transfer RNA, or tRNA. And tRNA really might as well be called 'translation RNA' because that's what it does, it translates from the language of nucleotides into the language of amino acids and proteins. On one end of the tRNA is an amino acid. On the other end is a specific sequence of three nitrogenous bases. These two ends are kind of matched to each other. Each of the 20 amino acids that we have in our body has its own sequence at the end. So if the tRNA has the amino acid methionine on one end, for instance, it can have UAC, as the nucleotide sequence on the other. Now it's like building a puzzle. The mRNA slides through the ribosome. The ribosome reads the mRNA three letters at a time, each set called a triplet codon. The ribosome then finds the matching piece of the puzzle: a tRNA with three bases that will pair with the codon sequence. That end of the tRNA, by the way, is called the anticodon. Sorry for all the terminology. You need to know it! And of course, by bringing in the matching tRNA, the ribosome is also bringing in whatever amino acid is on that tRNA. Ok so, starting at the five prime end of the mRNA that's fed into the ribosome, after the five prime cap for almost every gene, you find the nucleotide sequence AUG on the mRNA. The ribosome finds a tRNA with the anticodon UAC, and on the other end of that tRNA is methionine. The mRNA, like a mile-long dollar bill, keeps sliding into the ribosome so that the next codon can be read, and another tRNA molecule with the right anticodon binds on. If the codon is UUA, then the matching tRNA has AAU on one end and Leucine on the other, and if the mRNA has AGA, the matching tRNA 1has UCU on one end and Arginine on the other. 1In each case that new amino acid gets connected 1to the previous amino acid, starting a polypeptide chain. 1Which is the beginning, the very beginning of a protein. 1But it turns out there are lots 1of different ways to read this code. 1'Cause UUA is not the only triplet 1that codes for Leucine, UUG does too! 1And argenine is coded for by six different triplets! 1This is actually a good thing. 1It means that we can make a few errors in copying, 1transcribing and translating DNA, 1and we won't necessarily change the end product. 1This process continues, with the mRNA sliding in a bit, 1the ribosome bringing in a tRNA with another amino acid, 1that amino acid binding to the existing chain and on and on, 1sometimes for thousands of amino acids to make 1a single polypeptide chain, for example. 1This whole word is basically just the names 1of the amino acids in the sequence in the order 1in which they occur in the protein, all 34,350 of them. 1But before we can make our own Hot Pockets 1and that string of amino acids becomes my muscle tissue, 1we have some folding to do. 1That's because proteins, in addition to being hella big, 1can also contort into very complex 1and downright lovely formations. 1One key to understanding how a protein works 1is to understand how it folds, and scientists 1have been working for decades on computer programs 1to try to figure out protein folding. 1Now, the actual sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide, 1what you see scrolling along down there, 1is called its primary structure. 1One amino acid covalently bonded to another, 1and that one to another, in a single file. 1But some amino acids don't like to just hold hands 1with two others, they're a bit more promiscuous than that. 1The hydrogens on the main backbone of the amino acids 1like to sometimes form bonds on the side, hydrogen bonds, 1to the oxygens on amino acids a few doors down. 1When they do that, depending on the primary structure, 1they bend and fold and twist 1into a chain of spirals, called a helix. 1We also find several kinked strands laying 1parallel to one another, called pleated sheets. 1All those hydrogen bonds in pleated sheets 1are what make silk strong, for instance. 1So in the end, our promiscuous amino acids 1lead to wrinkled sheets. 1Uh-huh! 1These hydrogen bonds are what help give 1these polypeptides their secondary structure. 1But it doesn't end there. 1Remember the R groups that define each amino acid? 1Some of them are hydrophobic. 1Since the protein is in the cell, which is mostly water, 1all those hydrophobic groups try to hide 1from the water by huddling together, 1and that can bend up the chain some more. 1Other R groups are hydrophilic, which if nothing else, 1means that they like to form hydrogen bonds 1with other hydrophilic R groups. 1So we get more bonding, and more bending, 1and our single-file line has now taken on 1a massively complex three-dimensional shape. 1It also explains why I can fix my bed-head 1by wetting my hair with water. 1The water helps break some of those hydrogen bonds 1in the keratin which relaxes its structure. 1That way I can comb it out, and when it dries, 1those bonds reform, and voila, perfect hair. 1All of this shape caused by bonding between R groups 1gives our polypeptide its tertiary structure. 1So now we have a massively contorted polypeptide chain, 1and it actually contorts very precisely. 1Sometimes, just one chain is what makes up 1the whole enzyme or protein. 1In other proteins, like hemoglobin, several different chains 1come together to from a quaternary structure. 1So a quick review of structure: 1sequence is the primary structure, 1the backbone hydrogen bonds forming sheets and spirals 1are the secondary structure, R group bonds are tertiary, 1and the arrangement of multiple proteins 1together give the quaternary structure. 1These polypeptides are either structural proteins, 1like this thing at the bottom here that you 1can find in muscle or in my Hot Pocket. 1They might also be enzymes, and enzymes like, do stuff. 1They can cut up biological molecules like I do 1with this chef's knife, they can mix stuff 1and they can put stuff together. 1So from that one recipe book we got 1all of the ingredients and all of the tools necessary 1to make me, which is better than a Hot Pocket. 1Would you all agree?",science_biology_crash-course-bio-ecology
" Make a table and solve. A biologist is researching the impact of three different water-based sugar drinks on bees ability to make honey. He takes 2 liters of Drink A, which contains 40% sugar. So let me write this down. Let me make our table and then we can solve it. So let's take amount of drink. And then we'll say percent sugar. And then we can say sugar quantity, so the actual physical quantity of sugar. Maybe I should say sugar amount, or amount of sugar. Now this first drink, Drink A, it says he takes 2 liters of Drink A, which contains 40% sugar. The first column will be which drink we're talking about, so Drink A, he takes 2 liters of it. It's 40% sugar. So if we want the actual amount of sugar in liters, we just multiply 2 liters times 40%, or times 0.4. Let me write times with a dot so you don't think it's an x. 2 times 0.4, which is equal to 0.8 liters of sugar. So you have 0.8 liters of sugar. 1.2 liters of I guess the other stuff in there is water. But it's 0.8 of the 2 liters is sugar, which is 40%. Now,, he adds 1.2 liters of Drink B. He finds that bees prefer this new solution, Drink C. So when you add these two together, you end up with Drink C. And we end up with how much of Drink C? 2 plus 1.2 is 3.2 liters of Drink C, which has 25% sugar content. So this is 25% sugar, which also says we know the amount of sugar in it. Because if we have 3.2 liters of it and it's 25% sugar, or it's 1/4 sugar, that means that we have 0.8 liters of sugar here. So this is 0.8 liters of sugar. Well, that I already wrote in the column name. That's the amount of sugar. It's 25% sugar. We have 3.2 liters of it. Now, they want to know what is the percentage of sugar in Drink B? So let's just call that x. So that's right over here. Now, if it's x percent sugar here, or this is the decimal equivalent, that's x, how much sugar do we have? We have 1.2 liters times the decimal equivalent of sugar, so this is going to be 1.2 times x. Now let's think about it. We have 0.8 liters of sugar in Drink A, and when you add this amount to it, you still have 0.8 liters of actual sugar in Drink C. So this thing has to be equal to zero. We could set up an equation here. We could write 0.8 plus 1.2x is equal to 0.8. You subtract 0.8 from both sides. You get 1.2x is equal to 0. x has got to be equal to 0. So this thing right here has got to be zero. There's no sugar in Drink B. It's just got to be like 1.2 liters. I guess the solution is water. So it's 1.2 liters of water. There's no sugar in Drink B. It is 0% sugar.",math_algebra-home_alg-basic-eq-ineq
" -  So here's a question. If you got two positive charges, we know they're gonna repel. So if I put these next to each other, this blue charge would repel the green charge and vice versa, but how is that working exactly? I mean there's nothing in between these charges. How is the blue charge pushing on the green charge when it's not even touching it? So this is kind of a weird thing, right? If I want to push on something in my room, I need to walk up to that thing and actually physically touch it, and then give it a shove. Yet this blue charge seemingly exerts a force on the green charge with just empty space in between, right? There's no strings here. What is the mechanism? So physicists were kind of embarrassed and concerned about this. So it was like, all right, we can calculate exactly how much force there would be on each charge but we don't really know how that is actually working. It doesn't seem to be making any sense that a charge can push on another charge across potentially vast stretches of the universe here. This could be a huge distance and yet somehow this charge over here knows, ah, there's a charge over here pushing on me. How is that possible? This isn't new to electrical forces. This was a problem when Newton came up with the force of gravity. When Newton figured out how to calculate the force of gravity, he showed, okay, we can calculate how much the earth is gonna pull on the moon and people were like, this is great because now we can calculate and predict the orbits of the planets and comets. But when people were like, hey, Newton, that's really cool, but how is the earth pulling on the moon when there's nothing in between? Newton was basically like I don't know exactly why that works but I know the math lets me predict it exactly. And so ever since the time of Newton, this has been kind of in the back of physicists' minds for hundreds of years now as we let up to the electric force. People were kind of like, all right, how was this force at a distance actually being transmitted? Is there something in between here that's actually letting the earth pull on the moon? So finally when people were dealing with this electrical phenomenon, they decided, all right, it's time, it's time to answer how the two objects exert forces on each other across what a potentially vast distances of space. The person who came up with an explanation was named Michael Faraday. So this is Michael Faraday right here. He did his science in the 1800s generally regarded as one of the most important physicist/chemist of all time really. What Faraday said is this, he said, guys, here's how it's working. So this positive charge over here. So forget about the other positive. Forget about this green positive for a minute. Let's just focus on this blue one. He said, here's what the blue charge is really doing. He said this blue charge is creating an electric field all around it and we'll abbreviate this electric field with a capital E. Since it's a vector, we'll put a little vector arrow over the top. So Faraday said this positive charge creates an electric field everywhere around it at all times whether there's other charges nearby or not. The electric field gets weaker and weaker the farther out you go. So near the charge you've got a big electric field and then the farther away you go, the weaker the electric field is. So this is kind of like a spider web surrounding a spider except the spider is like the charge and the web is like the electric field. Now you gotta be careful. People see this and they think oh, this is just like electric force, right? But this is not a force. These vectors here are not forces. This is where people get really mixed up. They look like forces because people are like we use arrows to draw forces before. Aren't these just forces? They're not. It's a vector so we represent them with arrows but the electric field is not the exact same thing as electric force. So you gotta keep that straight. They are not the same thing. They're very related but they are not the same thing. Electric force is F. We represent it with F and maybe a little e for electric force and since it's a vector maybe we can draw it with a vector sign. But the electric force is not the same thing as electric field E. How are they related? Here's how it works. So even though the electric field is not a force, it can cause an electric force on other charges. So as it stands right now, if all we had was a positive charge, creating its electric field in the region surrounding it, there would be no electric force. You need two charges to have an electrical force. This charge is not gonna exert a force on itself. This blue charge and they keep these all straight. Let's just give this a name. We'll call this Q one. This charge Q one creates an electric field but that electric field, I'll call it E one because it's created by Q one. This E one does not exert a force on Q one. It will exert a force on any other charges that wander into this region. So this electric field that gets created by Q one just sits and waits patiently just like a spider web waits around the spider for another charge to wander in. Then it will exert a force on it. Let's put another charge in here. Let's say this positive charge has wandered into this zone for some reason who knows why. If it wanders into this region, there will be an electric force on this charge. Here's the story that Michael Faraday told us that made us feel better about how this force at a distance works. Michael Faraday said, ""Here's what's really happening. ""This positive charge Q one is creating an electric field ""all around it including this point over here ""where Q two is."" So we'll call this charge Q two. So there was already an electric field at that point that was being created by Q one. Now, when this Q two wanders into this region, the Q two just has to look at its immediate surroundings. At this point right here it sees this electric field. It senses it and it knows, okay, an electric field pointing to the right. That's gonna cause a force on me to the right. So it causes an electric force. The electric field is not an electric force but it will cause an electric force on a charge that wanders around into it. You might wander how is this any better. Well it keep things local. So physicists like it when things stay what we call a local. By local, we mean, okay, this charge Q two. In order to figure out what it should do, all it has to know about is the things and the space immediately surrounding it. So it just samples the electric field that at this point right here, it says, oh, there's an electric field pointing this way. I'm gonna feel an electric force into that direction. In other words, it doesn't have to know. It doesn't have to say, oh there's this positive charge on this other side of the galaxy and that's the thing exerting a force on me. Nope, it just knows. Oh, there's an electric field right here. That's all I need to know to figure out the electric force on me. So that's sort of how Faraday got around this question of how does one object exert a force on another object when there's nothing in between. He said there's a mediator basically that this first charge creates a field everywhere including at this point and then that field is creating a force on this charge that wanders into that zone. So yes, conceptually the way you could think about it is this. This charge Q one is creating the electric field E one. This electric field in this region is causing a force on this charge Q two and that's how Q two knows to feel the force it's supposed to feel which keeps things local. This Q two just has to know about the field right in its vicinity in order to figure out what to do. It doesn't have to know about things on the other side of the universe. But you could complain at this point. You might be like, ""Wait a minute. ""Doesn't Q two also create its own electric field? ""Wouldn't Q two also create an electric field ""every where around it?"" We could call that E two since it's created by charge too. Doesn't it create its own electric field just like all charges do? Yeah, it does. In fact it will create an electric field over here next to Q one and that's how Q one knows it's supposed to feel the force it feels in the direction that it feels it. So that's how these charges talk to each other. You could think about it that way. The way charges talk to each other is with the electric field. One charge creates an electric field over by the other charge. That charge feels the force. The other charge creates a field by the first charge. That first charge feels the force. So conceptually that's how this electric field works and that's how it does. So at this point you might not be impressed. You might be like, ""Are we just making up a story ""to make ourselves feel better here? ""Is this just some elaborate fairy tale that makes us ""so that we don't feel so awkward ""talking about things exerting forces ""on each other at a distance? ""Is there any benefit for doing this?"" And there is, there's a big benefit. Mathematically in terms of physics, talking about the electric field makes describing the physics way easier. In fact it makes it so that you don't even have to know about the charge creating that field at all. If you have a way of knowing the field even if you don't know what charge is creating that fied, you could figure out what the force is gonna be on any charge in that field without even knowing the charge that created that field and that turns out to happen a lot. So knowing the electric field is extremely useful. It lets you determine the electric force on a charge even if you don't know what charge is exerting that force. So up to this point, I've been trying to motivate why we would want this idea of the electric field, why physicists would come up with this idea. But I wouldn't blame you if at this point you aren't thinking, I still don't know what electric field is. I know what it isn't. Electric field is not electric force but what exactly is the electric field. So let me give the electric field a proper definition here. The electric field E at a point in space is defined to be the amount of electric force per charge exerted at that point in space. So this is what the electric field is. It's the force per charge. The way physicists usually think about this is imagine throwing a test charge in here. We call this a test charge. We'd like to imagine that this charge is really little so that it doesn't completely likes swamped and overwhelmed. The other charge is creating this field. Otherwise if you threw some huge charge in here, all the other charge would scatter and it would change the whole situation. So let's say we put a really small test charge in here. If I want to know what the electric field is at a point in space, I'd just bring my test charge over here, measure the amount of electric force on that test charge and then I just divide by how much was there in that test charge. What was the charge of that test charge? I'll call this charge two. If I take the force on charge two, divide it by charge two, 1that would be the value of the electric field 1at that point in space. 1So this is how we define the electric field. 1The definition of electric field is 1the amount of force per charge. 1In other words, let's put some numbers in here. 1Let's say Q two was two coulombs. 1This is actually an enormous amount of charge. 1This is kind of unrealistic example 1but it will make the numbers come out nice 1and conceptually it's the same thing. 1So a positive two coulombs was placed here. 1That's the value of Q two. 1Let's say when we measure the force on Q two, 1we're getting 10 newtons of force. 1In that case, we can just say, 1""All right, then the electric field, 1""in that region of that vicinity 1""is gonna be 10 newtons of force per two coulombs of charge 1""and we get an electric field of five. 1""Then the units are newtons per coulomb."" 1And that makes sense because what the electric field 1is really telling you is how many newtons of force 1you would get per coulomb. 1If you put more coulombs at that point in space, 1there'd be a greater force. 1This number is telling you the number of newtons 1you would get per coulomb. 1Since we had two coulombs at this point in space 1and there was five newtons per coulomb, 1the force was 10 newtons. 1So this number five newtons per coulomb is important 1because it's the same for any charge you put there. 1This is why the electric field is useful. 1At this point in space right here, 1if the electric field is five, 1it's five newtons per coulomb 1no matter what charge you put there. 1So if I put a four coulombs charge at that point, 1since there's five newtons for every coulomb, 1there'd be a 20 newton force there 1because there's five newtons for every coulomb. 1If there's four coulombs, there'd be five times four newtons 1which is 20 newtons. 1So you can imagine rearranging this formula another way. 1You could just multiply those sides by Q 1and you get that the electric force on a charge 1is equal to the value of that charge at that point in space 1multiplied by the value of the electric field 1at that point in space. 1But it's important to note this electric field is 1not created by this charge Q two. 1This was created by some other charge 1or collection of charges. 1Remember this charge Q one is creating this electric field 1E one and that electric field is causing 1this electric force on Q two. 1Q two did not create the electric field E one 1that it interacted with. 1Q one created that electric field E one. 1So people get mixed up. 1They see this formula. 1They start to think 1maybe this Q two is creating this electric field. 1It's not. 1This electric field is causing the electric force 1on that charge, not the other way around. 1This Q two is not creating this field. 1This field is causing the force on that charge. 1So this formula is extremely useful. 1If you know the electric field at a point in space, 1you can figure out the electric force on any charge 1at that point by just multiplying the two values together 1to get the electric force. 1So you can see now that the electric field 1is not the electric force. 1It's the amount of electric force per charge 1at a point in space. 1Very related but different. 1Different enough that you have to keep these ideas separate. 1Electric field is not electric force, and vice versa. 1Electric force is not electric field. 1The electric field is the amount 1of electric force per charge 1and the electric force on a charge at some point in space 1is the amount of charge times the electric field 1at that point in space. 1So recapping, electric charges create electric fields. 1These electric fields enter and cause forces 1on charges that exists in that region. 1The value of the electric field is representing 1the number of newtons of force per coulomb 1at that point in space. 1In terms of a formula, the electric field 1is the amount of force per charge 1or in other words the amount of electric force 1is the charge times the electric field 1at that point in space.",science_physics_electric-charge-electric-force-and-voltage
" Let's keep doing some Laplace transforms. For one, it's good to see where a lot of those Laplace transform tables you'll see later on actually come from, and it just makes you comfortable with the mathematics. Which is really just kind of your second semester calculus mathematics, but it makes you comfortable with the whole notion of what we're doing. So first of all, let me just rewrite the definition of the Laplace transform. So it's the L from Laverne & Shirley. So the Laplace transform of some function of t is equal to the improper integral from 0 to infinity of e to the minus st times our function. Times our function of t, and that's with respect to dt. So let's do another Laplace transform. Let's say that we want to take the Laplace transform-- and now our function f of t, let's say it is e to the at. Laplace transform of e to the at. Well we just substituted it into this definition of the Laplace transform. And this is all going to be really good integration practice for us. Especially integration by parts. Almost every Laplace transform problem turns into an integration by parts problem. Which, as we learned long ago, integration by parts is just the reverse product rule. So anyway. This is equal to the integral from 0 to infinity. e to the minus st times e to the at, right? That's our f of t. dt. Well this is equal to just adding the exponents because we have the same base. The integral from 0 to infinity of e to the a minus stdt. And what's the antiderivative of this? Well that's equal to what? With respect to C. So it's equal to-- a minus s, that's just going to be a constant, right? So we can just leave it out on the outside. 1/a minus s times e to the a minus st. And we're going to evaluate that from t is equal to infinity or the limit as t approaches infinity to t is equal to 0. And I could have put this inside the brackets, but it's just a constant term, right? None of them have t's in them, so I can just pull them out. And so this is equal to 1/a minus s times-- now we essentially have to evaluate t at infinity. So what is the limit at infinity? Well we have two cases here, right? If this exponent-- if this a minus s is a positive number, if a minus s is greater than 0, what's going to happen? Well as we approach infinity, e to the infinity just gets bigger and bigger and bigger, right? Because it's e to an infinitely positive exponent. So we don't get an answer. And when you do improper integrals, when you take the limit to infinity and it doesn't come to a finite number, the limit doesn't approach anything, that means that k the improper integral diverges. And so there is no limit. And to some degree, we can say that the Laplace transform is not defined with a minus s is greater than 0 or when a is greater than s. Now what happens if a minus s is less than 0? Well then this is going to be some negative number here, right? And then if we take e to an infinitely negative number, well then that does approach something. That approaches 0. And we saw that in the previous video. And I hope you understand what I'm saying, right? e to an infinity negative number approaches 0, while e to an infinitely positive number is just infinity. So that doesn't really converge on anything. So anyway. If I assumed that a minus s is less than 0, or a is less than s, and this is the assumption I will make, just so that this improper integral actually converges to something. So if a minus s is less than 0, and this is a negative number, e to the a minus s times-- well t, where t approaches infinity will be 0. Minus this integral evaluated at 0. So when you value this at 0, what happens? T equals 0. This whole thing becomes e to the 0 is 1. And we are left with what? Minus 1/a minus s. And that's just the same thing as 1/s s minus a. So we have our next entry in our Laplace transform table. And that is the Laplace transform. The Laplace transform of e to the at is equal to 1/s s minus a, as long as we make the assumption that s is greater than a. This is true when s is greater than a, or a is less than s. You could view it either way. So that's our second entry in our Laplace transform table. Fascinating. And actually, let's relate this to our previous entry in our Laplace transform table, right? What was our first entry in our Laplace transform table? It was Laplace transform of 1 is equal to 1/s, right? Well isn't 1 just the same thing as e to the 0? So we could have said that this is the Laplace-- I know I'm running out of space, but I'll do it here in purple. We could have said Laplace transform of 1 is the same thing as e to the 0 times t, right? And that equals 1/s. And luckily it's good to see that that is consistent. And actually, remember, we even made the condition when s is greater than 0, right? We assumed that s is greater than 0 this example. Here again, you say s is greater than 0. This is completely consistent with this one, right? Because if a is equal to 0, then the Laplace transform of e to the 0 is just 1/s minus 0. That's just 1/s. And we have to assume that s is greater than zero. So really these are kind of the same entry in our Laplace transform table. But it's always nice in mathematics when we see that two results we got in trying to do slightly different problems actually are, in some ways, connected or the same result. Anyway I'll see you in the next video and we'll keep trying to build our table of Laplace transforms. And maybe three or four videos from now I'll actually show you how these transforms are extremely useful in solving all sorts of differential equations. See you soon.",math_differential-equations_laplace-transform
" -  ""Which of the ordered pairs is a ""solution of the following equation?"" 4x minus one is equal to 3y plus five. Now, when we look at an ordered pair we wanna figure out whether it's a solution, we just have to remind ourselves that in these ordered pairs the convention, the standard, is is that the first coordinate is the x coordinate, and the second coordinate is the y coordinate. So they're gonna, if this is a solution, if this ordered pair is a solution, that means that if x is equal to three and y is equal to two, that that would satisfy this equation up here. So let's try that out. So, we have four times x. Well we're saying x needs to be equal to three, minus one, is going to be equal to three times y. Well, if this ordered pair is a solution then y is going to be equal to two, so three times y, y is two, plus five. Notice all I did is wherever I saw the x, I substituted it with three, wherever I saw the y, I substituted it with two. Now let's see if this is true. Four times three is twelve, minus one. Is this really the same thing as three times two which is six, plus five? See, 12 minus one is 11, six plus five is also 11. This is true, 11 equals 11. This pair three, two does satisfy this equation. Now let's see whether this one does, two, three. So this is saying when x is equal to two, y would be equal to three for this equation. Let's see if that's true. So four times x, we're now gonna see if when x is two, y can be three. So four times x, four times two, minus one is equal to three times y, now y we're testing to see if it can be three. Three times three plus five, let's see if this is true. Four times two is eight, minus one, is this equal to three times three? So that's nine plus five. So is seven equal to 14? No, clearly seven is not equal to 14. So these things are not equal to each other. So this is not a solution, when x equals two y cannot be to three and satisfy this equation. So only three, two is a solution.",math_algebra-basics_alg-basics-graphing-lines-and-slope
" -  Let's see if we can add five and 2/5 to three and 4/5. Pause this video and see if you can figure out what this is. All right, now let's do this together. We've had a little bit of practice adding mixed numbers in the past. And so one way to think about it is, you could view five and 2/5 as five plus 2/5. And then to that we're going to be adding three and 4/5, which you could view as three plus 4/5. And then you could just change the order with which you are adding, and say, all right, well, I could say five plus three, so that's five plus three, and then to that I could add 2/5 and 4/5, so, plus 2/5, plus 4/5. Now what is that going to get me? Well five plus three is going to be equal to eight. Eight plus, and then if I have 2/5, and I add four more fifths to that, well now I'm going to have 6/5. Two of something plus four of that something is going to be six of that something, and the something in this case are fifths. So now I'm going to have 6/5. So some of you might be tempted to say, ""Hey, isn't this just going to be equal to eight and 6/5?"" And you wouldn't be completely wrong if you said that. But pause this video and think about why this feels a little bit off. Well, the reason why this isn't standard, is the fractional part of this mixed number 6/5 is greater than one. So there's a whole inside of this 6/5. So the standard way to do this is see if we can break out that whole. Now what do I mean by that? Well I could rewrite eight plus 6/5 as eight plus 6/5 is the same thing as a whole, or 5/5 plus 1/5. And why is this useful? Well 5/5 is the same thing as one. And so now I can say this is going to be equal to eight plus one whole is nine, that's eight plus the 5/5, and then what I have leftover is 1/5. So nine and 1/5. And so this is the direction that people will traditionally go in. Now there's another way that you could approach it, which is really the same idea, we're just writing things a little bit differently. We could write this as five and 2/5 plus three and 4/5, and notice the way that I wrote it. I put all the fractions in the fraction column, I guess you could call it that way, and I put all of our whole numbers underneath each other, and if I had multiple digits here, I would align them according to place value. And then what we could do is we could say, okay 2/5 plus 4/5 is going to be 6/5. We could write 6/5 there. But we say, hey, there's something a little bit fishy about 6/5. That's really the same thing as 5/5 plus 1/5, or you could say that's the same thing as one and 1/5. 6/5 is equal to one and 1/5, and so what you could do is, you could write the 1/5 part in the fractions column, and then the one well now you're going to be regrouping that into our whole numbers, so you put a one right over there. Notice, 2/5 plus 4/5 is one and 1/5, which is the same thing as 6/5. And then you add the whole number part. One plus five plus three is nine. So you get nine and 1/5. But hopefully you realize that these are really the same idea, just different way of writing things",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_imp-fractions-2
" -  Part b, on what open intervals contained in negative three is less than x is less than four is the graph of f both concave down and decreasing? Give a reason for your answer. All right, so f and this should be both concave down and decreasing. So f concave down, concave down. That's going to be true if and only if the second derivative of f is less than zero which is true if and only if f prime is decreasing, f prime is decreasing. So that's how we can tell when f is concave down. I wanna see what do I need to observe of f prime because that's the graph they gave us. All right, now for f to be decreasing, f is going to be decreasing if and only if, we are decreasing when you have a negative slope if your relative change is negative. So that's true if and only if f prime of x is less than zero. So both true. Both true when f prime of x is less than zero and decreasing, and, let me write, and f prime is decreasing. And f prime, decreasing. So let's see if we can identify that. Well, let's go back to our graph and see when is f prime of x less than zero and decreasing. So if we look at less than zero, let me highlight this, so less than zero. I'm highlighting it in magenta right over here. This is all the places where we are less than zero in magenta. And now of that, where are we decreasing? Well, we are decreasing over this interval right over here. So that would be negative two is less than x which is less than negative one. So that's we're decreasing of the places where we are negative. I'm taking the subset of where we are negative to think what we're decreasing. We're decreasing right there. And we are also decreasing, we are also decreasing right over there. So that is one is less than x which is less than three. Now we are decreasing before x equals negative two over here but we're not less than zero there so I'm not gonna include that. And so we have our intervals. So our open intervals. So we have both true for when these two things are true. And so this happens. This happens when negative two is less than x is less than negative one or one is less than x is less than three. So those are two open intervals. This one and that one.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-solved-exams
" -  In this video, we're going to think about the economic profit of a monopoly, of a monopoly firm. And to do that, we're gonna draw our standard price and quantity axes, so that's quantity, and this is price. And this is going to of course be in dollars, and we can first think about the demand for this monopoly firm's product. And the demand curve would look similar to other demand curves that we've seen multiple times, that at a high price, people wouldn't be demanding a lot, and then at a lower price, or as price goes lower, people are going to demand a higher and higher quantity, or the market will demand a higher, and higher quantity. So that might be the demand curve. Now what's interesting about any imperfectly competitive firm, and the extreme case is a monopoly, is what the marginal revenue curve looks like given this demand curve. In a perfectly competitive firm, the marginal revenue curve is equal to the demand curve, and in that situation, it's actually a horizontal line. But here, because when the monopoly firm reduces price, it doesn't just reduce it on that incremental unit, it would be typical that it would have to reduce its price on all of the units, and we've studied this in other videos. You have a marginal revenue curve that would go down faster than the demand curve, it would look something like this, and if this is unfamiliar to you, I encourage you to watch some of those videos that go into depth why this is happening. So it's a monopoly, or actually any imperfectly competitive firm, its marginal revenue curve will go down faster than the demand curve. So what would be a rational quantity for this firm to produce? Well to think about that, we have to think about its marginal cost curve. So its marginal cost curve, the typical way we often think about it is, at first you get some economies of scale, but then you start having coordination costs, and maybe some diseconomies of scale, your inputs start getting more expensive, and so your marginal cost curve might look something like that. And the rational quantity produced is, as long as your incremental revenue for every unit is higher than your incremental cost for every unit, you would wanna produce more, and more, and more, and more until the point that your marginal cost is equal to your marginal revenue. And so the rational quantity to produce right over here would be right over there. I'll do that Q, I could call that Q for the firm, I could also call that Q sub M, because we're dealing with a situation where the firm is, at least from the producer side, it is the market, it is the only producer, it's a monopoly. But what's the price here? Well to know that, we just have to look at the demand curve. At this quantity, the price is right over here. So the price is right over here, and once again, we could call that the market price, and so something interesting has happened here for the monopoly firm. In a perfectly competitive firm, where the marginal cost and demand curves intersect, that's what dictated the demand, because the demand curve and the marginal revenue curve were the same. But here, we are now producing a quantity less than that, we're producing a quantity where price is greater than marginal cost, you could see it right over there. At this quantity price is greater than marginal cost, and so you can view this difference right over here as kind of a markup that is possible for a monopoly firm to do that would not be possible with a perfectly competitive firm. And this also introduces an idea of dead weight loss. Because at least in theory, at a higher quantity, people were willing to pay more than the marginal cost, so you would think that there is some type of a benefit that the market as a whole could gain from that incremental unit, or those incremental units, and then even some more incremental units. It feels like there's to gain, but because of what is rational for this monopoly firm, and there's insurmountable barriers for entry for other people to enter, this is not going to be captured until you have this dead weight loss. Now an interesting question, and this is where I started off is, well what would be the economic profit for this monopoly firm? And to think about that, we have to think about the average total cost curve. And so the average total cost, I'll draw a typical average total cost curve, it might look something like this. While marginal cost is below the average total cost, the average total cost will trend downwards, and as soon as marginal cost is higher than average total cost, well now of course, average total cost is going to start trending upwards. So marginal costs intersects the average total cost curve at the minimum point right over there. And so based on this average total cost curve, it looks like this monopoly firm is earning an economic profit, because at that quantity, this is the price per unit it's getting. This is the average cost per unit, so on average per unit, it's getting this height, it's getting this difference right over here, and then if you were to multiply it times the number of units, well that's going to give you its economic profit. So you could view the economic profit in this situation as being this shaded area of this rectangle. So I'll leave ya there. The big thing to appreciate is, when we're dealing with imperfect competition, and the extreme form of a monopoly, your marginal revenue curve is no longer your demand curve, and your marginal revenue curve is downward sloping like this, it's not the flat curve that we saw with the perfect competition. And because of that, your marginal cost is going to intersect marginal revenue at a quantity where price is greater than marginal cost, which introduces dead weight loss in the market, and the way to think about the economic profit is to compare what that price in the market is at that quantity, to the average total cost at that quantity. And what's also interesting about this monopoly firm is because of the barriers to entry, we talked about in the long run with perfect competition, if there's economic profit going on, more entrants would enter into the market, but that's not going to happen in a monopoly because the barriers to entry are so high. So this monopoly is sitting pretty, it's going to be able to keep earning this type of economic profit, unless something dramatically changes in the market somehow.",economics-finance-domain_ap-microeconomics_imperfect-competition
" Let me draw a good old PV diagram. That's my pressure axis, this is my volume axis. Just like that, I have pressure and volume. I showed several videos ago that if we start at some state here in the PV diagram, right there, and that I change the pressure and the volume to get to another state, and I do it in a quasistatic way, so essentially I'm always close to equilibrium, so my state variables are always defined, I could have some path that takes me to some other state right there. And this is my path. I'm going from this state to that state. And we showed that if I just did this, the work done by the system is the area under this curve. And then if I were to move back to the previous state, and then if I were, you know, by some path, just some random path that I happened to be drawing, the work done to the system would be the area under this light blue curve. So the net work done by the system ended up being the area inside of this path. So this is-- let me do it in different color. The net work done would be the area inside of this path when I go in this clockwise type of direction. So this is the net work done by the system. And now, we also know that if we're at some point on this PV diagram, that our state is the same as it was before. So if we go all the way here, and then go all the way back, all of our state variables will not have changed. Our pressure is the same as it was before. Our volume was the same as it was before because we went all the way back to that same point on the PV diagram. And our internal energy is also the same point as it was before, so our change in internal energy over this path, you're going to have a different internal energy here than you had here, but when you go around the circle and you get back, your change in internal energy is equal to zero. And we know that our change in internal energy is defined as, and this is from the first law of thermodynamics, the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system. Now, if we go on a closed loop on our PV diagram, then what's our change in internal energy? It's zero. So we get zero change in internal energy, because we're at the same state is equal to the heat applied to the system minus the work done or-- and I've done this little exercise multiple times. I think is probably the fourth or fifth time I'm doing it. We get that the heat added to the system, if we just add w to both sides, is equal to the work done by the system. So this area inside of this path, I already said, it's the work done by the system, and if you don't remember even where that came from, it was, remember, pressure times volume times change in volume is a little incremental change in work, and that's why it relates to the area. But we've done that multiple times. I won't go there just yet. So if you have any area here, some heat was added to the system, some net heat, right? Some heat was added here, and some heat was probably taken out here, but you have some net heat that's added to the system. And I use that argument to say why heat isn't a good state variable. Because-- and I had a whole video on this-- that if I define some state variable, let's just say, heat content. Let's say I want to define some state variable heat content. And I would say that the change in heat content would, of course, be equal to the change in heat. That's what I'm defining. If I'm adding heat to the system, my heat content should go up. But the problem with that heat content state variable was that, let's say over here, I say that the heat content is equal to 5. Now, I just showed you that if we go on some path here and we come back, and there's some area in this little path that I took, that some heat was added. So let's say that this area right here, so this is q is equal to the work done by the system, let's say it's equal to 2. So every time, if I start at heat content is equal to 5, that's just an arbitrary number, and I were to do this entire path, when I go back, the heat content would have to be 7. And then when I go back and do it again, my heat content would have to be 9. And it would have to increment by 2 every time I do this exact path. It would have to increment by the amount of area that this path goes around. So heat content can't be a state variable, because it's dependent on how you got there. A state variable-- and remember this. In order to be a state variable, if you're at this point, you have to have the same value. If your internal energy was 10 here, when you do the path and you come back, your internal energy will be 10 again. That's why internal energy is a valid state variable. It's dependent only on your state. If your entropy was 50 here, when you soon. go back and you do all sorts of crazy things, and you come back to this point, your entropy is once again 50. If your pressure here is 5 atmospheres, when you come back here, your pressure will be 5 atmospheres. Your state variable cannot change based on what path you took. If you're at a certain state, that's all that matters to the state variable. Now this heat content didn't work, and that's why we actually led into some videos where I divided by t and we got entropy, which was an interesting variation. But that's still not satisfying. What if we really wanted to develop something that could in some way be a state variable, but at the same time measure heat? So obviously, we're going to have to make some compromises, because if we just do a very arbitrary kind of heat content variable, then every time you go around this, it's going to change. That's not a valid state variable. So let's see if we can make up one. So let's just make up a definition. Let's call my new thing that I'm going to try to maybe approximate heat, let's call it h, and just as a little bit of a preview, we're going to call it enthalpy. And let's just define it. I'm just playing around. Let's just define it as the internal energy plus my pressure times my volume. So then what would my change in enthalpy be? So my change in enthalpy will be, of course, the change of these things. But I could just say, that's my change in my internal energy plus my change in pressure times volume. Now, this is interesting. And I want to make a point here. This, by definition, is a valid state variable. Why is it? Because it's the addition of other state variables, right? At any point in my PV diagram, and it's also true if I did diagrams that were entropy in temperature or anything that dealt with state variables, at any point on my diagram, u is going to be the same, no matter how I got there. p is by definition going to be the same. That's why it's at that point. v is definitely going to be the same point. So if I just add them up, this is a valid state variable because it's just the sum of a bunch of other valid state variables. So let's see if we can somehow relate this thing that we've already established as a valid state variable. From the get-go, from our definition, this works because it's just the sum of completely valid state variables. So let's see if we can relate this somehow to heat. So we know what delta u is. If we're dealing with all of the internal energy or the change in internal energy, and I'm not going to deal with all the other chemical potentials and all of that, it's equal to the heat applied to the system minus the work done by the system, right? Let me put everything else there. The change in enthalpy is equal to the heat applied minus the work done-- that's just the change in internal energy-- plus delta PV. This is just from the definition of my enthalpy. Now this is starting to look interesting. What's the work done by a system? So I could write change in h, or enthalpy, is equal to the heat applied to the system minus-- what's the work done by a system? If I have some system here, it's got some piston on it, you know, if we're doing it in a quasistatic, I have those classic pebbles that I've talked about in multiple videos. When I apply heat or let's say I remove some of these pebbles, so I'm at a different equilibrium, but what's actually happening? When is the work being done? You have some pressure being applied up here, and this piston is going to be moving up, and your volume is going to increase. And we showed multiple videos ago that the work done by the system can be, and you can kind of view this as the volume expansion work, it's equal to pressure times change in volume. And let's add the other part. So this was our change in internal energy. And I had several videos where I show this. And now let me add the other part of the equation. So our enthalpy, our change in enthalpy, can be defined by this. Now. Something interesting is going on. I said that I wanted to define something, because I wanted to somehow measure heat content. My change in enthalpy will be equal to the heat added to the system, if these last two terms cancel out. If I can somehow get these last two terms to cancel out, then my change in enthalpy will be equal to this, if somehow these are equal to each other. So under what conditions are these equal to each other? Or another way, under what conditions is delta pressure times volume equal to pressure times delta volume? When does this happen? When can I make this statement? Because if I can make this statement, then these two 1terms are equivalent right here, and then you my change 1in enthalpy will be equal to the heat added. 1Well, the only way I can make this statement is if pressure 1is constant. 1Now why is that? 1Let's just think about it mathematically. 1If this is a constant, then if I just change-- you know, if 1this is just 5, 5 times a change in something is the 1same thing as the change in 5 times that thing, so it just 1mathematically works out. 1Or if you view it another way, if this is a constant, you can 1just factor it out, right? 1Well, if I said, the change in 5x, that would be equal to 5 1times x final minus 5 times x initial. 1And you could say, well, that's just equal to 5 times x 1final minus x initial. 1Well, that's just equal to 5 times the change in x. 1It's kind of almost too obvious for me to explain. 1I think sometimes when you overexplain things, it might 1become more confusing. 1So this applies-- and the 5 I'm just doing as the analogy 1for a constant. 1So if pressure is constant, then this equation is true. 1So if pressure is constant-- so this is a key assumption-- 1then if heat is being applied in a constant pressure 1system-- so we could write it this way. 1I'll write it multiple times, because this is key. 1If pressure is constant, then our definition, our little 1thing we made up, this enthalpy thing, which we 1defined as internal energy plus pressure and volume, then 1in a constant pressure system, our change in enthalpy we just 1showed is equal to the heat added to the system because 1all of these two things become equivalent under constant 1pressure, so I should write that. 1This is only true when heat is added in a 1constant pressure system. 1So how does this gel with what we did up 1here on our PV diagram? 1What's happening in a constant pressure system? 1Let me draw our PV diagram. 1That's P, that's V. 1So what's happening in constant pressure? 1We're at some pressure right there. 1So if we're under constant pressure, that means we can 1only move along this line. 1So we could go from here to there and back to there, or we 1could go from there to there, back to there. 1So we could go there, all the way there, and then go back. 1But what do we see about this? 1Is there any area in this curve? 1I mean, there is no curve to speak of, because we're 1staying in a constant pressure. 1We've kind of squeezed out this diagram. 1We've made the forward path and the return path the same 1exact path. 1So because of this, you don't have that state problem 1because no net heat is being added to the system when you 1go from this point all the way to this point and then back to 1this point. 1So because of that, you can kind of see visually that 1enthalpy in a constant pressure, when you're not 1moving up and down in pressure, is the same thing as 1heat added. 1So you might say, hey Sal, this was a bit of a 1compromise, constant pressure, you know, that's a big 1assumption to make. 1Why is this useful at all? 1Well, it's useful, because most chemical reactions, 1especially ones that occur in an open beaker, or that might 1occur at sea level, and that should be a big clue, they 1occur at constant pressure. 1You know, if I'm sitting at the beach, and I have my 1chemistry set, and I have some beaker of something, and I'm 1throwing other stuff into it, and I'm looking for a reaction 1or something, it's a constant pressure system. 1This is going to be atmospheric pressure. 11 atmosphere. 1I'm sitting at sea level. 1So this is actually a very useful concept for everyday 1chemical expressions. 1It might not be so useful for engines, because engines 1always have pressure changing, but it's very useful for 1actual chemistry, for actually dealing with what's going to 1happen to a reaction at a constant pressure. 1So what we're going to see is that this enthalpy, you can 1kind of view it as the heat content 1when pressure is constant. 1In fact, it is the heat content 1when pressure is constant. 1So somehow-- well, not somehow, I showed you how-- we 1were able to make this definition, which by 1definition was a state variable, because it was the 1sum of other state variables, and if we just make that one 1assumption of constant pressure, it all of a sudden 1reduces to the heat content of that system. 1So we'll talk more in the future of measuring enthalpy, 1but you just have to say, if pressure is constant, enthalpy 1is the same thing as-- and it's really only useful when 1we're dealing with a constant pressure. 1But if we have a pressure constant, enthalpy can be 1imagined as heat content. 1And it's very useful for understanding whether chemical 1reactions need heat to occur or whether they release heat, 1so on and so forth. 1See",science_chemistry_thermodynamics-chemistry
" -  So as of now, we haven't really been able to identify one true cause of Multiple Sclerosis. But we have been able to identify a number of both genetic and environmental factors that may be involved in propagating the disease. So first I kinda wanna talk a little bit about the genetics. So how do we know that there is a genetic component to the disease? Well, we do, what are called, twin studies. So in these twin studies, what we'll do, is we'll take a pair of identical twins, and a pair of fraternal twins, and we'll compare them. So we know that identical twins have the same DNA, and fraternal twins have different DNA. So what we can do, is we can compare the incidence of Multiple Sclerosis in identical twins and in fraternal twins. So let's say one of the identical twins has Multiple Sclerosis, then the likelihood of the other twin having the disease is about 25 to 30 percent. But in fraternal twins, that number is about as low as five to 10 percent. So given the fact that identical twins have the same DNA, and that fraternal twins have different DNA, this tells us that there is a pretty high genetic component in Multiple Sclerosis. But Multiple Sclerosis, as far as genetics is concerned, is actually pretty complicated. It's thought that about over 50 genes are involved. And they're still finding more and more to this day. Now there's actually one gene that I want to talk about, and the reason why is because this gene is involved in autoimmunity, and it's found on Chromosome six. So, here's the chromosome in question, and you'll notice that I've actually highlighted the part here in red. And this part will contain a gene called HLA-DRB1. And you know, this is kind of a lot of letters here, so we'll mostly just focus on this part over here, the HLA part. So what is HLA? Well, it just stands for Human Leukocyte Antigen. So, H-L-A. So, what does this guy do? Well, let's say that you have any general cell over here, on this cell, you're going to have a protein on the surface. And that is going to be our human leukocyte antigen. This human leukocyte antigen will then have some other kind of protein or peptide bounded to it. And that protein or peptide may belong to something like a virus, or bacteria, or something that shouldn't belong. And so what it's gonna do, is it's actually going to present that to another cell, namely, your T cells. So maybe we have a T cell over here. So the T cell is going to look at this peptide that's being presented by the original cell, and it's going to say, ""Okay, so this doesn't belong here, ""so we need to kind of begin an attack and defend the body."" So really, this entire gene is important for allowing the immune system to determine what is part of the body and what isn't part of the body. And it's thought that a malfunction in this gene is implicated in autoimmunity. Now, remember that Multiple Sclerosis is also an autoimmune disease. So, it's thought that when this gene malfunctions, then this could potentially lead to Multiple Sclerosis. So that's some evidence that, you know, genetics may be involved. But now I wanna talk a little bit more about the environment. And there are a lot of different factors. So first what we're going to do is we're actually gonna look at a picture of the earth here. So here, we have the equator. And at the equator is a pretty low incidence of Multiple Sclerosis. And as you move north from the equator, that incidence increases. So why is that, why is there this kind of geographic spread of the disease? Well, at the equator, there's a lot of sunlight. So people who live here will be exposed to a lot of sunlight. When you're exposed to a lot of sunlight, then your skin can actually start to produce vitamin D. So, on average, people who live near the equator will have more vitamin D than people who live further away from the equator. Now why is this important? Well, vitamin D is actually thought to be involved in regulating the immune system. So a lot of immune cells, let's say you have a T cell over here, a lot of these immune cells may have a receptor for vitamin D as well. So maybe you have vitamin D here in red, and it's kind of bound to this receptor of this T cell. And when you have a deficiency in vitamin D, it's thought that this can lead to autoimmunity. So as you move further and further up north, you're exposed to less sunlight. If you're exposed to less sunlight, then you have, you most likely have less vitamin D in you. If you have less vitamin D in you, then this could lead to an autoimmune disorder, namely Multiple Sclerosis. So it's thought that this may be the reason why the incidence of MS increases as you move away from the equator. Another environmental factor is exposure to some kind of virus in your childhood. So what kind of virus are we talking about here? Well, there are a lot of different viruses that may be implicated. So for example, the Epstein-Barr virus, measles, mumps, and even herpes. So it's really important to know that these viruses themselves do not directly cause Multiple Sclerosis. But if you have had exposure to these viruses in the past, then your chances of developing the disease is increased. So why does this happen? Well, it's thought that the proteins in this virus actually resemble some of the proteins that are found in your nervous system. And so this phenomenon is called molecular mimicry. It's when the virus kind of resembles what's in the body, and the immune system actually kind of confuses the two. So the last thing I want to talk about is smoking. Now we all know that smoking is bad for your lungs, but it's also thought that smoking may increase your chances of getting Multiple Sclerosis. So if you look at a group of people who smoke and who have Multiple Sclerosis, if they stop smoking, then the progression of their disease slows down. So why exactly this happens, we're not 100 percent sure. All we know is that there's this correlation between smoking and the development of Multiple Sclerosis. So I've shown you a lot of different risk factors that may be involved in developing Multiple Sclerosis. So here on the genetic side, you have over 50 genes that may be involved, and I've also shown you all these different environmental factors that may be involved as well. But unfortunately, we haven't really been able to connect all these factors together. And because of that, we haven't really been able to identify a single cause for the disease. But as it is right now, these are some of the major risk factors implicated in getting Multiple Sclerosis.",science_health-and-medicine_nervous-system-diseases
" Let's say we have a circle, and then we have a diameter of the circle. Let me draw my best diameter. That's pretty good. This right here is the diameter of the circle or it's a diameter of the circle. That's a diameter. Let's say I have a triangle where the diameter is one side of the triangle, and the angle opposite that side, it's vertex, sits some place on the circumference. So, let's say, the angle or the angle opposite of this diameter sits on that circumference. So the triangle looks like this. The triangle looks like that. What I'm going to show you in this video is that this triangle is going to be a right triangle. The 90 degree side is going to be the side that is opposite this diameter. I don't want to label it just yet because that would ruin the fun of the proof. Now let's see what we can do to show this. Well, we have in our tool kit the notion of an inscribed angle, it's relation to a central angle that subtends the same arc. So let's look at that. So let's say that this is an inscribed angle right here. Let's call this theta. Now let's say that that's the center of my circle right there. Then this angle right here would be a central angle. Let me draw another triangle right here, another line right there. This is a central angle right here. This is a radius. This is the same radius -- actually this distance is the same. But we've learned several videos ago that look, this angle, this inscribed angle, it subtends this arc up here. The central angle that subtends that same arc is going to be twice this angle. We proved that several videos ago. So this is going to be 2theta. It's the central angle subtending the same arc. Now, this triangle right here, this one right here, this is an isosceles triangle. I could rotate it and draw it like this. If I flipped it over it would look like that, that, and then the green side would be down like that. And both of these sides are of length r. This top angle is 2theta. So all I did is I took it and I rotated it around to draw it for you this way. This side is that side right there. Since its two sides are equal, this is isosceles, so these to base angles must be the same. That and that must be the same, or if I were to draw it up here, that and that must be the exact same base angle. Now let me see, I already used theta, maybe I'll use x for these angles. So this has to be x, and that has to be x. So what is x going to be equal to? Well, x plus x plus 2theta have to equal 180 degrees. They're all in the same triangle. So let me write that down. We get x plus x plus 2theta, all have to be equal to 180 degrees, or we get 2x plus 2theta is equal to 180 degrees, or we get 2x is equal to 180 minus 2theta. Divide both sides by 2, you get x is equal to 90 minus theta. So x is equal to 90 minus theta. Now let's see what else we could do with this. Well we could look at this triangle right here. This triangle, this side over here also has this distance right here is also a radius of the circle. This distance over here we've already labeled it, is a radius of a circle. So once again, this is also an isosceles triangle. These two sides are equal, so these two base angles have to be equal. So if this is theta, this is also going to be equal to theta. And actually, we use that information, we use to actually show that first result about inscribed angles and the relation between them and central angles subtending the same arc. So if this is theta, that's theta because this is an isosceles triangle. So what is this whole angle over here? Well it's going to be theta plus 90 minus theta. That angle right there's going to be theta plus 90 minus theta. Well, the thetas cancel out. So no matter what, as long as one side of my triangle is the diameter, and then the angle or the vertex of the angle opposite sits opposite of that side, sits on the circumference, then this angle right here is going to be a right angle, and this is going to be a right triangle. So if I just were to draw something random like this -- if I were to just take a point right there, like that, and draw it just like that, this is a right angle. If I were to draw something like that and go out like that, this is a right angle. For any of these I could do this exact same proof. And in fact, the way I drew it right here, I kept it very general so it would apply to any of these triangles.",math_geometry-home_cc-geometry-circles
" In the last video we defined internal energy as literally all the energy that's in a system. That's kind of the most inclusive version, at least in my head. So that's my system, it's some type of container. And I have a bunch of particles in here. It's literally the sum of the kinetic energies of all these particles. If they had potential energies, we'd throw that in there. If they have electrical potential, we'd throw that in there. If they have bonds with each other, the energies in that bond, we would throw it in there. It's everything. It's all inclusive. And, I told you in the last video it's unintuitive that U stands for internal energy. But I kind of think that, you know, U, it contains the universe of energy. You know, that's just for me to memorize it. Don't think too deeply into what I just said. But this is internal energy. If you show me a system, it has some internal energy. It's a function of its state. I don't care how it got to that state, but if you told me a system at a certain state, maybe with a certain pressure, or a certain volume, or at a certain temperature-- although if you give me pressure and volume that should be enough-- I can tell you what its internal energy is. Especially if you tell me the type of molecule I have, and things like that. Now we also said in the last video that because internal energy is all the energy in the system, it can't be randomly created or destroyed. It can just be transformed from one form to another. So if I have a change in internal energy, it can only be due to-- well, it can be due to more than what I'm describing. But in our simple world where all of the energy in a system-- and maybe we're dealing with gases, because that's normally what you deal with in a first-year chemistry course-- it's going to be the heat that could be added to the system, plus the work done on the system. And like I said in the last video, sometimes they'll say, instead of plus the work done on the system, sometimes they'll say, minus the work that the system does. Either way. And here I just want to make another side discussion here, because I decided to write it without the little deltas here. And the reason why I did that is if you were to write this equation, which you will see, you'll see it in textbooks, teachers will do it-- nothing inherently criminal about that-- but I just do that because it clears in my mind what heat and what work are relative to internal energy. If I were to write delta U is equal to heat delta Q plus delta W to me this implies that at some point I had some amount of heat in my system, and then I have a different amount of heat in my system, and I took the difference between the two and I got a change in heat. So this implies that heat is somehow an inherent macrostate of the system, and that's not the case. I can tell you what the internal energy of this system is. I can tell you its pressure. I can tell you its volume. I can tell you its temperature. These are all macrostates of the system. I don't know how it got to this situation, but I can tell you about it. I cannot tell you what the heat is of this system. And that might be a little unintuitive, because if I ask you, hey I have a cup of coffee, what's the heat of it? You might say, oh, it's, you know, you might give me the temperature. Because in our everyday language we use things like heat and temperature interchangeably. But in thermodynamics, heat is a transfer of energy. A way to think about it is, if internal energy is your bank account. So you could say change in bank account. And it really is like the energy bank account of a system. If you have a change in a bank account, you had some deposits or withdrawals. And heat and work are really just deposits or withdrawals into our energy bank account. Heat is one kind. Maybe heat is like a wire transfer. So you could say it's wire transfers to your account. Transfers to your account plus check deposits. Now it makes a lot of sense to say, you could say, what is my value of my bank account? Or you could say what is my change in my bank account? You take two snapshots of your bank account at two different times. But would it make sense to say-- you know, I could say I wire transferred $10, right? So I could say, this statement would be plus $10. And I could say that I wrote $20 in checks, minus $20 in checks. In which case, my change in my bank account would be minus $10. Now would it make sense for me to say change in wire transfer? That implies that when I started off maybe my bank account had $100 in it and now it has $90. When my bank account had $100 in it, did it have any wire transfer amount? No, wire transfer was how money was deposited or taken away from my account. Likewise, it didn't have a checking deposit account, so I can't really-- it just seems weird to me to say change in wire transfer is $10, or change in check deposits is $20 or minus $20. Would you say, I made a $10 wire transfer and I paid $20 in checks. So I had a net change in my bank account of $10. Likewise, I say how much work was done to me or I did, which is essentially a deposit or withdrawal of energy. Or I could say much heat was given to me or how much heat was released, which is another way of depositing or withdrawing energy from my energy bank account. So that's why I like to stick to this. And I like to stay away from this. And just like I said, you can't say how much heat is in the system. So someone will say, oh, how much heat is in this? You cannot say that. There's no heat state variable for that system. You have internal energy. The closest thing to heat, we'll talk about it in a future video, is enthalpy. Enthalpy is essentially a way of measuring how much heat is in a system, but we won't talk about that just now. And you can't say how much work is in a system. You can't say, oh I have x amount of work in a system. The system can do work or have work done to it, but there's not a certain amount of work, because that energy in the system could be all used for work, it could all be used for heat, it could all be used for a ton of different things. So you can't say those things. And that's why I don't like treating them like state variables, or state functions. So with that said, this is our definition. Let's do a couple of simple problems, just to give you intuition. And I really want to make you comfortable. My real goal is to make you comfortable with, when to know to use plus or minus on the work. And the best way to do it is not to memorize a formula, but just to kind of think about what's happening. So let's say that I have some system here and, I don't know, it's a balloon. And let's say that I have no change in internal energy. Internal energy is 0. And for our purposes we can kind of view it as the kinetic energy of the particles haven't changed. And let's say by expanding a bit, by my balloon expanding a bit-- I did some work. I'll do this in more detail in the next video. So the system does 10 joules of work. My question is, how much heat was added or taken away from the system? So the way I can think about it-- you don't even have to write the formula down, or you can write it-- you could say, look, the internal energy, the amount of energy in the system hasn't changed. The system did 10 joules of work. So that's energy going out of the system. It did 10 joules. So 10 joules went out in the form of work. If the internal energy did not change, then essentially 10 joules of energy had to go into the system. 10 joules had to go into the system. If it didn't, the internal energy would have gone down by the amount of work we had. And the only way, if is this is the net work, the only way that we're talking about, that we can add energy outside of work, is through heat. So 10 joules of heat must have been added. So we can write 10 joules of heat added to system. Now let's look at that from the point of view of the actual formula. If we have delta U is equal to heat added, plus work done to the system, then we would say, OK, this was 0. It's equal to the heat added to the system. Remember, in this way we're saying this is the heat done, or the work done, to the system. W is work done. Now, the system did work to something else. It didn't have work done to it. So if this is work done to the system, and it did work, then this is going to be a minus 10. Minus 10 joules. And then you solve both sides of this. You add 10 to both sides and you get 10 is equal to Q, which is exactly what we got up here. But this can get confusing sometimes, because you're like, oh, is this heat that the system did? Is this heat that was added to the system or taken away? The convention tends to be that this is heat added. But then sometimes it's confusing. Is this the work done to the system or work done by? And that's why I like just doing it this way. If the system does work it loses energy. If the system has work done to it, it gains energy. So let's do another problem. 1I mean, I could have done this exact same thing using the 1other formula that you'll sometimes see. 1Delta U is equal to Q minus the work that the system does 1by the system-- Work done by the system. 1And in this case, once again, change in 1internal energy was 0. 1That is equal to heat added to the system, 1minus the work done. 1So minus-- I told you at the beginning of the problem that 1the system did 10 joules of work-- so minus the work done. 1Minus 10 joules. 1We get the same situation up here from 1two different formulas. 1And we got 10 is equal to Q. 1Either way, the heat added to the system is 10 joules. 1Let's do one more. 1Let's say that, I don't know, 5 joules of heat taken away 1from system. 1And let's say that 1 joule of work done on system. 1So maybe we're compressing the balloon on the system. 1What is our change in internal energy? 1Let's just figure out our change. 1So the way I think of it is 5 joules of heat taken away from 1the system, that's going to reduce our internal 1energy by minus 5. 1And if 1 joule work is done onto the system, we're putting 1energy into it so that'll be plus 1. 1So minus 5, plus 1, is going to be minus 4. 1Or enter our change in internal 1energy is minus 4 joules. 1Now we could have done that a little bit more formally with 1the formula, change in internal energy is equal to 1heat added to the system, plus work done on the system. 1So it's equal to heat added to the system. 1We had 5 joules heat taken away, so this is minus 5, plus 1work done on the system. 1We have 1 joule of work done on the system, and there we 1get, once again, minus 4. 1Now, I could have written that same formula the other way. 1I could have said change in internal energy is equal to 1heat added to the system minus the work that the system does. 1I want to do this both ways, because I don't want you to 1get confused, either way you see it on problems or in 1school, or maybe you take one class that does it one way and 1one class that does it the other. 1If you use it this way, what was the heat 1added to the system? 1We had heat taken away, so it's minus 5. 1So minus the work that the system does, how much work 1does the system do? 1Well, the system had 1 joule of work done to it. 1So it did itself minus 1 joules of work. 1So it's minus minus 1. 1I want to be clear, when I use this formula, this is work 1done by system, done by. 1This is work done to. 1The system had work done to it. 1So it had minus 1 joules of work done by the system, so 1these become pluses, and you get back to a minus 4. 1Do whatever's intuitive for you. 1For me, this tends to be the most intuitive, where you 1don't even use a formula. 1We just think, if I'm doing work, I'm using up energy. 1If I get work done to me, I'm being handed over energy. 1If I have heat taken away from me, I'm giving away energy. 1If I have heat added to me, I'm getting energy. 1See you in the next video.",science_chemistry_thermodynamics-chemistry
" In the next few videos I'm going to embark on something that will just result in a formula that's pretty straightforward to apply. And in most statistics classes, you'll just see that end product. But I actually want to show how to get there. But I just want to warn you right now. It's going to be a lot of hairy math, most of it hairy algebra. And then we're actually going have to do a little bit of calculus near the end. We're going to have to do a few partial derivatives. So if any of that sounds daunting, or sounds like something that will discourage you in some way, you don't have to watch it. You could skip to the end and just get the formula that we're going to derive. But I, at least, find it pretty satisfying to actually derive it. So what we're going to think about here is, let's say we have n points on a coordinate plane. And they all don't have to be in the first quadrant. But just for simplicity of visualization, I'll draw them all in the first quadarant. So let's say I have this point right over here. Let me do them in different colors. And that coordinate is x1, y1. And then let's say I have another point over here. The coordinates there are x2, y2. And then I can keep adding points. And I could keep drawing them. We'd just have a ton of points. There and there and there. And we go all the way to the nth point. Maybe it's over here. And we're just going to call that xn, yn. So we have n points here. I haven't drawn all of the actual points. But what I want to do is find a line that minimizes the squared distances to these different points. So let's think about it. Let's visualize that line for a second. So there's going to be some line. And I'm going to try to draw a line that kind of approximates what these points are doing. So let me draw this line here. So maybe the line might look something like this. I'm going to try my best to approximate it. Actually, let me draw it little bit different. Maybe it looks something like that. I don't even know what it looks like right now. And what we want to do is minimize this squared error from each of these points to the line. So let's think about what that means. So if the equation of this line right here is y is equal to mx plus b. And this just comes straight out of Algebra 1. This is the slope on the line, and this is the y-intercept. This is actually the point 0, b. What I want to do, and that's what the the topic of the next few videos are going to be, I want to find an m and a b. So I want to find these two things that define this line. So that it minimizes the squared error. So let me define what the error even is. So for each of these points, the error between it and the line is the vertical distance. So this right here we can call error one. And then this right here would be error two. It would be the vertical distance between that point and the line. Or you can think of it as the y value of this point and the y value of the line. And you just keep going all the way to the endpoint between the y value of this point and the y value of the line. So this error right here, error one, if you think about it, it is this value right here, this y value. It's equal to y1 minus this y value. Well what's this y value going to be? Well over here we have x is equal to x1. And this point is the point m x1 plus b. You take x1 into this equation of the line and you're going to get this point right over here. So that's literally going to be equal to m x1 plus b. That's that first error. And we can keep doing it with all the points. This error right over here is going to be y2 minus m x2 plus b. And then this point right here is m x2 plus b. The value when you take x2 into this line. And we keep going all the way to our nth point. This error right here is going to be yn minus m xn plus b. Now, so if we wanted to just take the straight up sum of the errors, we could just some these things up. But what we want to do is a minimize the square of the error between each of these points, each of these n points on the line. So let me define the squared error against this line as being equal to the sum of these squared errors. So this error right here, or error one we could call it, is y1 minus m x1 plus b. And we're going to square it. So this is the error one squared. And we're going to go to error two squared. Error two squared is y2 minus m x2 plus b. And then we're going to square that error. And then we keep going, we're going to go n spaces, or n points I should say. We keep going all the way to this nth error. The nth error is going to be yn minus m xn plus b. And then we're going to square it. So this is the squared error of the line. And over the next few videos, is I want to find the m and b that minimizes the squared error of this line right here. So if you viewed this as the best metric for how good a fit a line is, we're going to try to find the best fitting line for these points. And I'll continue in the next video. Because I find that with these very hairy math problems, it's good to kind of just deliver one concept at a time. And it also minimizes my probability of making a mistake.",math_statistics-probability_describing-relationships-quantitative-data
" We're all used to the traditional operators like addition and subtraction and multiplication and division. And we've seen there's multiple ways to represent this. But what we're going to do in this video is a little fun. We're actually going to define our own operators. And what's neat about this is it kind of shows how broad mathematics can be. And on a more practical sense, it's actually something that you might see on some standardized tests. And the reason why they do that is so that you can appreciate that these aren't the only operators out there-- plus exponentiation and all those-- that in mathematics, you can define a whole new set of operators. So let's just do that. So let me just define x diamond y. And I'm going to define that as 5x minus y. So you could view this as defining it a function. But we're defining it using an operator. So if I have x diamond y, by definition, we have defined this operator. That means that's going to be equal to 5x minus y. So given that definition, what would 7 diamond 11 be? Well, you just go to the definition. 7 diamond 11. Instead of an x we have a 7. So it's going to be 5 times 7. So let me do it 5 times 7 minus, and instead of a y, we have an 11. So one way to think about it is, in our definition, every place you saw an x, you could replace with a 7, every place you saw a y, you replace with an 11. So you have minus 11 over here. Let me make the number-- So this is the 7. This 7 is this 7. And this 11 is this 11 right over here. And then we just evaluate that. So 5 times 7 is 35. So this is equal to 35 minus 11, which is equal to 24. So 7 diamond 11 is equal to 24. We can define other things. We can define something crazy like, let me define a-- well, I mentioned a star, let me use a star-- a star-- let me write it this way-- a star b. Let's say that that is the same thing as-- I don't know-- a over a plus b. And so same idea. What would 5 star 6 be? Well, you go back to the definition. By definition, every place where you see the a, you would now replace with a 5. Every time you saw the b, you would now replace with a 6. So this is going to be equal to 5 over 5 plus 6. a plus b. a is 5, b is 6 over 5 plus 6. So this would be 5/11. And then you can compound them. And we haven't defined any order of operations for these particular operations that we've just defined. So we're going to be careful to use parentheses when we put some of these together, but you can do something like, something interesting, like negative 1 diamond 0 star 5. And once again, we just focus on parentheses, because that's the only thing that's telling us what to start on first. Because we haven't figured out, we haven't defined whether diamond takes precedence over star, or star takes precedence over diamond the way that we have that saying that, hey, you do multiplication before you do addition. We haven't defined it for those operations, but that's what the parentheses helps us do. So we want to evaluate these parentheses first. 0 star 5 that is 0-- because you could view this 0 as the a and the 5 as the b--so it's going to be 0 over 0 plus 5, which is just going to be 0. So this over here, 0 or 5 just goes to 0. So this whole expression simplifies to negative 1 diamond-- this diamond right over here-- diamond 0. And now we go to the definition of the diamond operator. Well, that's five times the first number in our operator, or the first term that we're giving the operator. I guess you could think of it that way. So 5 times that. So it'll be 5 times negative 1, x is negative 1 minus y. Well, y here is the 0. Minus 0. So 5 times negative 1 is negative 5. And you will see-- and the idea here is just to make you feel comfortable defining new operators like this. And not being daunted if all of a sudden you see a diamond, and they're defining the diamond for you. And you're like, wait, I never saw a diamond. They're actually defining it for you, so you shouldn't say, I never saw a diamond. You should say, well, they've defined a diamond for me. This is how I use that operator. And sometimes you'll see even wackier things. You'll see things like this. Let me draw. So they'll define. I don't know if you would even consider this an operator. But you'll see something like this, that by definition, if someone writes a symbol like this, and they put-- a, b, c-- let me write it this way-- a, b, c, d. They'll say this is the same thing as ad minus b, all of that over c. And once again, this is just a definition. They have this weird symbolic way of representing these variables in all this. But they're defining how do you evaluate this crazy expression. And so, if someone were to give you, were to say, evaluate this diamond. Let me evaluate the diamond. So evaluate the diamond where, in my little sections of the diamond, I have a negative 1, a 5, a 3, and a 2. We would just use the definition of how to evaluate this diamond. And we'd say, OK, every time we see an a, that is going to be negative 1. So we have a negative 1 times d. Well, d is whatever is in the bottom right section of this diameter or this kite. So d is going to be 2. Let me write it this way. This is a. This is b. This is c. And this is d. So it's going to be negative 1 times 2 minus b-- well b is 5-- minus 5, all of that over c, which is 3. So this is going to be equal to negative 2 minus 5. So that is negative 7 over 3. And you could go crazy like this. And it might be a fun thing, actually, if you have some spare time. Define your own operators and see how creative you can get with those operators.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-relations-functions
" Where we left off in the last video, we'd expressed our line integral around the boundary of our surface. So this is f.dr where our path is this boundary right over here-- this path c. We had expressed it in terms of a line integral around this boundary-- around path c1-- which is the boundary of region R. And the reason why this is going to be valuable to us is now we can directly apply Green's Theorem to this to turn this into a double integral over this region right over here-- the region that it is actually bounding. So let's actually do that. We're just applying Green's Theorem here. So Green's Theorem. And actually, let me box this off right over here. This was just something that we wrote to remind ourselves in the last video. So let me just box it off right over here. But when you apply Green's Theorem, you get that this is going to be the exact same thing as the double integral over the region that c1 bounds-- that region, R, that's in our xy plane-- of the partial of this with respect to x of this business. So I'll do that in that same green color. Q plus R times the partial of z with respect to y minus the partial with respect to y of P plus R times the partial of z with respect to x. And then, dA, little differential of our region. dA. And so let's actually calculate this right here. You take the partials of each of these expressions. And we'll see that if we expand them and then simplify, we'll get something very similar-- or actually, hopefully, identical-- to this right over here. And that'll show that this line integral for this special case is the same thing as this surface integral, which will prove Stokes' theorem for this special case. So let's do it. So let's just apply the partial derivative operator. So first we want to take the partial derivative with respect to Q. And we need to remind ourselves-- and we did this way up here where we first thought about it-- we saw that P, Q, and R, they're each functions of x, y, and z. So we're assuming that's how they're represented. And if z was not a function of x, then, if we were to take the partial of Q with respect to x, we would just write it as a partial of Q with respect to x. But we know that we've assumed that z is itself a function of x and y. So if we're taking the partial with respect to x over here, we have to think first-- Well, how can Q directly change with respect to x? And then, how can it change due to something else changing due to x? And so that other thing that could change due to x is z. y is independent of x, but z is a function of x. So let's keep that in mind. So we're really going to do the multi-variable chain rule. So when we try to take the derivative of this part, of this whole function with respect to x, we have to think about-- How will Q change directly with respect to x? And to that, we have to add how Q could change due to changes in other variables due to changes in x. And the only other variable that Q is a function of that could change due to a change in x is z. So Q could also change to z because z has changed due to x. So the operator here is the partial with respect to x plus the partial of Q with respect to z times the partial of z with respect to x. If we rewrote Q so that z was substituted with x's and y's-- because it is a function of x and y's-- then we would just have to write this first term right over here. But we're assuming this is expressed as a function of x, y, and z. And z itself is a function of x. And so that's why we had to use the multi-variable chain rule. Now, let's move to the next part. And both of these might have some x's in them. So we have to use the product rule right over here. So first, we can take the derivative of r with respect to x. And then, multiply that times z sub y. Then, we have to take the derivative of z sub y with respect to x and multiply that times R. So this is going to be plus. If we take the derivative of this with respect to x, same exact logic-- R can change directly due to x, and it can change due to y. And that could change due to z and multiply that times how z could change due to x. Once again, you could view this as the multi-variable chain rule in action here. But of course, we take the derivative of the first term times the second term. And I'll do the second term in magenta. So the partial of z with respect to y plus the derivative of the second term-- which is the partial of z with respect to y, and then taking the partial of that with respect to x, which we could just write as that-- times the first term. So that's the partial with respect to x of all of this business right over here. And then, we need to subtract the partial of this with respect to y. And we're going to use the exact same logic. So then, we're going to subtract-- and I'll put it in parentheses like that. So P could change directly due to y. I will circle P. Let me do it with a color that I haven't used yet. P could change directly due to y. So we could say the partial of P with respect to y, but it could also change due to z changing because of y. So plus the partial with respect to z times the partial of z with respect to y-- and I'll do R maybe in that same color-- plus the derivative of R. Well, we already figured that, but actually now it's with respect to x, not with respect to y. You have to be careful. So it's going to be the partial of R with respect to y plus the partial of R with respect to z times the partial of z with respect to y times z sub x plus-- now, we take the derivative of the second term times the first term. The derivative of the partial of z with respect to x, then with respect to y, is going to be z. And then we're going to multiply that times R. And now, let's see if we can expand this out. And hopefully, things simplify. And just a reminder, I'm just working on the inside of this double integral. I'll rewrite the double integral and the dA once I get this all cleaned up a little bit. So let me rewrite it a little bit. So this is equal to the partial of Q. I'll try to color-code it the same way. And this is really just algebra at this point. The partial of Q with respect to x plus the partial of Q with respect to z times the partial of z with respect to x plus the partial of R with respect to x times the partial of z with respect to y. And then plus the partial of R with respect to z times the partial of z with respect to x times the partial of z with respect to y. And then we have this term right over here-- which I'll just do in purple-- plus the partial of z with respect to y, and then respect to x, times R. And now, we're going to subtract all of this business right over here. I'll do it in the blue. Minus the partial of P with respect to y minus the partial of P with respect to z times the partial of z with respect to y. And then we're going to subtract from that. Minus the partial of r with respect to y times-- we want to distribute this-- times the partial of z with respect to x minus the partial of R. This gets a little bit tedious. But hopefully, it'll get us to where we need to go. The partial of R with respect to z times the partial of z with respect to y times the partial of z with respect to x. And then, finally, this term right over here minus this-- because we have that negative out there-- minus the partial of z with respect to y, then with respect to x, and then with respect to yR. Now, let's see if we can simplify things. So the first thing-- this and this look to be the same. We just can commute the order in which we actually multiply. But these are the exact same term. So that is going to cancel out with that. And because we assumed way up here that we have continuous second derivatives of the function z-- z is a function of x and y, that that is equal to that-- we can now say that these two right over here are going to be the negatives of each other or that they are going to cancel out. And so this simplified things a good bit. And let's see if I can group terms in a way that might start to make sense. And actually, I'm going to try to see if I can make them similar to this. So I have all the terms that have a z sub x and the z sub y and then the rest of them. So z sub x I'll do in blue. So you have the terms that have a z sub x in it. So you have this term right over here and this term right over here. And we can factor out the z sub x. And we get the partial of z with respect to x times the partial of Q with respect to z minus the partial of R with respect to y. And then, let's do the-- and I want to get the colors the same way, too. I did yellow next. 1Plus, I have all the terms of the partial of z 1with respect to y. 1So it's that term and that term right over here. 1So it becomes plus the partial of z with respect to y 1times the partial of R with respect 1to x minus the partial of p with respect to z. 1And then we have these last two terms. 1And I used the color green up there, 1so I'll use the color green again. 1So for these two terms, I'll just 1write plus the partial of Q with respect 1to x minus the partial of P with respect to y. 1So our double integrals have kind of-- I 1can't really say simplified-- but we 1can rewrite it like this. 1And we don't want to forget this was all a simplification 1of our double integral over the region dA. 1This is what we have been able to using 1Green's theorem and the multi-variable chain rule 1and whatever else. 1We've been able to say that that line 1integral around the boundary of our surface 1is the same thing as this. 1And now, we can compare that to what our surface integral was. 1So let's see if I have space. 1So copy. 1And then, let me see if I have space up here to paste it. 1Well, it doesn't look like I actually have much space 1to paste it, although I'll try anyway. 1So if I paste it, you see that they are identical. 1They are identical. 1Our line integral is identical to this. 1We get the exact same thing. 1So our line integral, f.dr, around this path c 1simplified to this and our surface integral simplified 1to this. 1So using the assumptions we had, they 1both simplified to the same thing. 1So now we know, for this special case, 1our line integral is equal to our surface integral. 1And we are done.",math_multivariable-calculus_greens-theorem-and-stokes-theorem
" -  ""Giovanna usually takes bus B to work, ""but now she thinks that bus A gets her to work faster. ""She randomized 50 workdays between a treatment group ""and a control group. ""For each day from the treatment group, she took bus A; ""and for each day from the control group, she took bus B. ""Each day she timed the length of her drive."" This is really interesting what she did, it's very important, she randomized the 50 work days. Before she did this, instead of just kinda waking up in the morning and just deciding on her own which bus to take. Because humans are infamously bad at being random. Even when we think we're being random, we're actually not that random. She might inadvertently be taking bus A earlier in the week. Or maybe the commute times are shorter. Or maybe she inadvertently takes bus A when the weather is better, when there's less traffic. Remember, there's a natural tendency for human beings to want to confirm their hypothesis. So, if she thinks that bus A is faster maybe she'll want to pick the days where she'll get data to confirm her hypothesis. It's really important that she randomize the 50 workdays. What I could imagine she did is maybe she wrote each of the work days, the dates, on a piece of paper. She would have 50 pieces of paper and then she turned them all upside down or maybe she closed her eyes and then she moved them all over her table. Then with her eyes closed she randomly moved them to either the left or the right of the table. If they moved to the left of the table then those are the days she'll take bus A, if she moves them to the right of the table those are the days she takes bus B. That's how she can make sure that this is truly random. So then they tell us, this is important, ""The results of the experiment showed that the median ""travel duration for bus A is eight minutes less than ""the median travel duration for bus B."" Or one way to think about, if we said, ""The treatment group ""median minus the control group median. ""What would we get?"" Well, the treatment group is eight minutes less than the control group? Right? This is A, this is B, so if this is eight less than this, then this is going to be equal to negative eight. This is just another way of restating what I have underlined right over here. Someone's car alarm went off, hope you're not hearing that. Anyway, I'll try to pay attention while it's going off (chuckles). ""To test whether the results could be explained ""by random chance, she created the table below, ""Which summarizes the results of 1000 re-randomizations ""of the data, with differences between medians ""rounded to the nearest five minutes."" What is going on over here? You might say well look, ""She got her result that she ""wanted to get, this data seems to confirm that ""bus A gets her to work faster. ""What's all this other business with re-randomization ""she's doing?"" The important thing to realize is, and she realizes this, is that she might have just gotten this data that I underlined, by random chance. There's some chance maybe A and B are completely similar, in terms of how long they take in reality. She just happened to pick bus A on days where bus A got to work faster. Maybe bus B is faster but she just happened to take bus A on the days that it was faster. The days it just happened to have less traffic. What she's doing here is she re-randomized the data and she wants to see that with all this re-randomized data, out of these 1000 re-randomizations, what fraction of them do I get a result like this? Do I get a result where A is eight minutes or more faster? Or you could say that the median travel duration for bus A is eight minutes less, or even less than that, than the median travel for bus B. So if it was nine minutes less, or 10 minutes less, or 15 minutes less, those are all the interesting ones. Those are the ones that confirm our hypothesis, that bus A gets to work faster. Let's look at this table, it's not below, it's actually to the right. Let's just remind ourselves what she did here, cause the first time you try to process this it can seem a little bit daunting. So, in her experiment, let me write this down, experiment... The car alarm outside which you probably, hopefully are not hearing, it's actually a surprisingly pleasant sounding car alarm, sounds like a slightly obnoxious bird, but anyway (laughs). Her experiment is, the way I described it, 25 days she would take bus A, 25 days she would take bus B. She would record all the travel times and let's say that I have 25 data points in each column. Let's say they get 12 minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, and you just keep going, there's 25 data points. Let's just say that there are 12 data points less than 20 minutes and 12 data points more than 20 minutes. In this circumstance, her median time for bus A would be 20 minutes and I just made this number up. So in order for this to be eight minutes less than the median time for bus B, the median for bus B would have to be 28 and maybe you have data points here. Maybe this is 18 and you have 12 more that are less than 28. Then you have 12 more that are greater than 28. So the median time for bus B would be 28, once again I just made this data up. If you took treatment group median. I 'll just write TGM for short. TGM minus control group median. What do you get? 20 minus 28 is negative eight. This is the actual results of.... These are theoretical, potential results, hypothetical results for her actual experiment. Now what's all of this business over here? What she did is she took these times and she said, ""You know what, let's just imagine a world where I could ""have gotten any of these times randomly on either bus."" So she just randomly re-sorted them between A and B, she did that a thousand times. The first time, the second time, the third time. She does this 1000 times. I'm assuming she used some type of computer program to do it and each time, once again, she just took the data that she had and she just rearranged it, she just reshuffled it. Maybe A on one day. Maybe it got this 18. Maybe it gets the 25. Maybe it gets a 30. Once again, I got the 18, the 25, the 30 and maybe B gets the... You know she's reshuffling all these other data points that I just have with dots and maybe B... Let's see she had the 18, 25, 30, maybe 12, 20, and 28. So in this circumstance, this random reshuffling and she keeps doing it over and over again. In this random reshuffling, the treatment group median minus the control group median is going to be what? It's going to be equal to positive five. In this random shuffling, this hypothetical scenario, Bus A's median would have been five minutes longer than bus B's. If she gets this result with this random re-sorting, this would have been... She would have had a column here for five. Then she would have put one notch right over here. It looks like she classified things or maybe she didn't even get the data but she classified them by multiples of two. If she got this again then she would have put a two here. Then she would have said, ""Okay, in how many of these ""random reshufflings am I getting a scenario where ""there's a five minute difference? ""Or where the treatment group was five minutes longer?"" What is this saying? For example, this is saying that 18 out of the 1000 reshufflings, which she just randomly re-shuffled the data, 18 out of those 1000 times, she found a scenario where her treatment group median was 10 minutes longer than her control group. Where bus A's median was in this hypothetical re-randomization where the treatment group is 10 minutes slower than the control group. There were 159 times where the treatment group... Once again, in her random reshuffling, these aren't based on observations, these are random reshufflings. There's 159 times where her treatment group is four minutes slower than her control group. The whole reason for doing this is she says, ""Okay, what's the probability of getting a result ""like this or better?"" I say, ""better"", as one that even more confirms her hypothesis, that the treatment group is faster than the control group. Well, the scenario, this scenario is this one right over here and then another one that the treatment group is even faster, is this right over here. Here, the treatment group median is 10 less than the control group median. In how many of these scenarios, out of the thousands, is this occurring? Well, this one occurs 85 times, this one occurs eight. If you add these two together, 93 out of the thousand times, out of her re-randomization or I guess you could say 9.3 percent of the time, the data... 9.3 percent of the randomized, the 1000 re-randomizations, 9.3 percent of the time she got data that was as validating of a hypothesis or more than the actual experiment. One way to think about this is, the probability of randomly getting the results from her experiment or better results from her experiment are 9.3 percent. They're low, it's a reasonably low probability that this happened purely by chance. Now, a question is, ""What's the threshold?"" If it was a 50 percent you say, ""Okay, this was very 1""likely to happen by chance."" 1If this was a 25 percent you're like, ""Okay, it's less 1""likely to happen by chance but it could happen."" 19.3 percent, it's roughly 10 percent. 1For every 10 people who do an experiment like she did, 1even if it was random, one person would get data like this? 1What typically happens amongst statisticians is they draw 1a threshold and the threshold for 1statistical significance is usually five percent. 1One way to think about it, the probability of her getting 1this result by chance, 1this result or a more extreme result? 1One that more confirms her hypothesis by chance 1is 9.3 percent. 1If you're cut-off for significance is five percent. 1If you said, ""Okay, this has to be five percent or less."" 1Then you say, ""Okay, this is not statistically significant."" 1There's more than a five percent chance that I could 1have gotten this result purely through random chance. 1Once again, that just depends on where you 1have that threshold. 1When we go back, I think we've already answered 1the final question, ""According to the simulations, 1""what is the probability of the treatment group's median 1""being lower than the control group's median 1""by eight minutes or more?"" 1Which once again, eight minutes or more, that would be 1negative eight and negative 10. 1We just figured that out, that was 93 out of the 1000 1re-randomizations, so it's a 9.3 percent chance. 1If you set five percent as your cut-off for statistical 1significance, you say, ""Okay, this doesn't quite meet my 1""cut-off so maybe this is not a statistically 1""significant result.""",math_statistics-probability_significance-tests-confidence-intervals-two-samples
" I'm just using two tones here, but you could have very large, or subsets of your program, where you get to a point, and you say, OK I need this to repeat, based on some condition. So to get into loops, the block is right here. If you're working under the complete pallet, you will find it under Flow. Here I'm going to click and drag and drop it somewhere here, doesn't matter. I'll put it here. And as you can see, the loop is actually empty. So if I run this program, I won't even get to these tones, because it will get stuck here. I'm going to drag the sound blocks inside our loop so we can do something. I will go ahead and run this program, to see if it's working. [BEEPING] What if we want to do something a little more interesting? Perhaps we want to terminate this loop based on some sensor condition. So click on the drop down box, and select Sensor. Now a bunch of settings pop up. First it wants to know, OK, what setting, what sensor, do you want to use to control the loop? And in this case I will leave it on Touch Sensor for now. And now I'm going to plug the touch sensor into port two. It could be any port, I'm using port two right now. You need to select the port that this sensor is plugged in to. And finally, the action is asking us, OK, what action will cause this loop to terminate? When I execute the program, it will jump into this loop. And every time it hits the end of the loop, it will check, is the button pressed? And if it has not been pressed, it will continue to loop. And when I press the button, it will terminate the loop. So let's run this and see how it goes. [BEEPING] OK, I'm going to press the button in three, two, one. And it worked. So this is very interesting, because if you think about it, we could have even a color sensor controlling the loop. Perhaps when the color sensor saw red, or when the sound sensor detected a clap. [CLAP] Aside from that, we can also control the loop based on time, which means we could put in the number of seconds we want it to run for. Below time, we have count, which tells us how many times a loop will iterate. Every time it hits the end and jumps back to the beginning, you can think of that as one iteration. So if I put the count to 2, this loop will just run twice. And the final method to control a loop is based on logic. If you select the Logic tab, it will be asking for a true or false. And this is a value, which you will manually wire into here. And I will leave that for another video. The last thing to remember about loops, aside from how they can be controlled, is that they can be nested, which is very powerful. For example, nesting means you can drop a loop inside of another loop. Now sound will be helpful here, because we will be able to listen to what's going on. First, I'm going to drag a sound block inside this loop here. So our program will begin, jump inside the main loop. Then it will hit this sound block, play a tone for 0.5 seconds, play the next tone for 0.5 seconds. Then it will hit this interior loop, which we currently have as running forever, which we probably don't want, because it will get stuck there. So I'm going to put the count to 2, which means when we get here, it will run this loop twice. And inside the loop I have a new sound block, which I will put to Tone, and I'll play a lower tone. So we'll be able to hear when we fall into that loop. After our two iterations of this loop, it will break out, hit our main loop, which will jump back to the beginning, and the process will repeat. So let's listen to what's going on here. I will run the program. [BEEPING] So when you hear that lower tone, that is when we fall into the interior loop. And nesting can be done many times. I can put two loops beside each other here. I could even put a third loop inside here. And so on and so forth. So with nesting and control, you can do pretty much anything you can think of, in terms of repeating behaviors.",science_electrical-engineering_lego-robotics
" -  So what we have depicted in this diagram is the business cycle that we have looked at in other videos. This horizontal axis is time. The vertical axis is real GDP. What we see in this dark blue color, you can view that as full employment output at different points in time, and you can see that it is growing. So this economy is experiencing economic growth. Maybe it's population is increasing, they're getting more productive, maybe with better education or with better technology. But we know that real economies don't just have this nice, clean economic growth. They tend to cycle around their full employment output. There are times when they are above the trend line. Like right over here, you have a positive output gap. So this is a positive output gap at that point right over there. And you could also have negative output gaps. We also talked in other videos about fiscal policy. These are tools that governments might use in order to close these output gaps. For example, when you have a positive output gap, a government might be afraid that things are overheating. Maybe they're afraid of inflation. They might have contractionary fiscal policy. They might try to do something for that moment in time to bring to close that gap a little bit. More likely, when there's a negative output gap and people are out of work, the government will say, ""Hey, let's pass a stimulus package, ""explicitly to try to close this gap. Let's lower taxes. ""Let's increase government spending."" That type of fiscal policy, where the government is doing something special for that circumstance in order to close that output gap, that is discretionary, discretionary fiscal policy. It's at the discretion of the government to do it. What we're going to focus on in this video are automatic stabilizers. These are things that people don't have to take special action based on the circumstances in order for them to help smooth out the business cycle. So automatic stabilizers. So what are examples of automatic stabilizers? So one common one is taxes. So pause this video for a second and think about how do taxes help smooth out these fluctuations? So let's think about what's happening at a part of the business cycle where the economy's expanding, let's say right over there, or let's say right over here. What would be happening with taxes? Well, in these realities, with this positive output gap, you could imagine people's incomes are going to get higher and higher, corporate profits are going to be more and more, and so our change in taxes is going to be positive, and not only is it going to be positive, not only are taxes going to increase in absolute dollar terms, but they're probably gonna grow at a faster rate than the economy. Why is that? When the economy turns positive, when you start expanding more, more and more corporations are going to become profitable. If you think about personal income taxes, below certain incomes in a lot of countries, you don't even have to pay income taxes, and that for every incremental dollar or every incremental $10,000, the tax rate on that incremental chunk could go up. And so that's why the absolute dollar amount of taxes will likely increase at a faster rate than the actual economic growth. And let's think about the other scenario. Let's think about what taxes do when we are in a recession. So let's say we pick that place right over there. Well, in this situation, corporate profits are going to be lower. In fact, some corporations are gonna become unprofitable, in which case they wouldn't pay corporate taxes. People are gonna make less and less money. So your change in taxes here is going to be likely to be negative. And once again, your rate of decrease in taxes is likely to be greater than your rate in decrease of real GDP. The tax multiplier is negative, and so it might smooth out the curve a little bit. Now another example of an automatic stabilizer would be things like welfare payments or unemployment insurance. Why would these be automatic stabilizers? Well, when times are good, when you have this positive output gap, fewer and fewer people are going to need welfare or they're going to need unemployment payments, and so in that world, that is like a decrease in government spending. The government's not going to have to pay for these benefits. And so decrease in government spending, that's contractionary, and so that'll help smooth out the curve a little bit. And once again, when we go into our recession and then when we start having our negative output gaps, more people are going to be on welfare. More people are going to need their unemployment benefits and so that's going to increase government spending, which might, with the multiplier, smooth out this curve a little bit. And so the big takeaway is is when the government does something explicitly for the time that they are in in order to smooth out the curve, that's discretionary fiscal policy. But you might have things in the system, the existing tax policy, existing laws around welfare, or unemployment insurance, or other benefits that might have an effect of, regardless of where we are in the business cycle, they have a dampening effect. They would smooth out these oscillations a little more. They would be automatic stabilizers.",economics-finance-domain_ap-macroeconomics_national-income-and-price-determinations
" Two of the points that define a certain quadrilateral are negative 4 comma negative 2. So let's plot that. So that's negative 4 comma negative 2. And 0 comma 5. So that's 0 comma 5 right over there. The quadrilateral is left unchanged by a reflection over the line y is equal to x over 2. So what does that line look like? y is equal to x over 2. I'll do that in the blue. y is equal to x over 2. So when x is equal to 0, y is 0. The y-intercept is 0 here. And the slope is 1/2. Every time x increases by 1, y will increase by 1/2. Or when x increases by 2, y will increase by 1. So x increases by 2, y increases by 1. X increases by 2, y increases by 1. Or another way to think about it, y is always 1/2 of x. So when x is 4, y is 2. When x is 6, y is 3. When x is 8, y is 4. So we can connect these. Let me try my best attempt to draw these in a relatively straight line. And then I can keep going. When x is negative 2, y is negative 1. When x is negative 4, y is negative 2. So it actually goes through that point right there. And it just keeps going with a slope of 1/2. So this line, and I can draw it a little bit thicker now, now that I've dotted it out. This is the line y is equal to x over 2. And they also say that the quadrilateral is left unchanged by reflection over the line y is equal to negative 2x plus 5. So the y-intercept here is 5. When x is 0, y is 5. So it actually goes through that point. And the slope is negative 2. Every time we increase by 1-- or every time we increase x by 1, we decrease y by 2. So that would go there. We go there. And we keep going at a slope of negative 2. So it's going to look something like this. It actually goes through that point and just keeps going on and on. So this is my best attempt at drawing that line. So that is y is equal to negative 2x plus 5. Now let's think about it. Let's see if we can draw this quadrilateral. So let's first reflect the quadrilateral, or let's reflect the points we have over the line y is equal to x over 2. So this is the line y is equal to x over 2. This magenta point, the point negative 4, 2 is already on that line. So it's its own reflection, I guess you could say. It's on the mirror is one way to think about it. But we can easily reflect at this line over here. This line, if we were to drop a perpendicular-- And actually, this line right over here, y is equal to negative 2x plus 5 is perpendicular to y is equal to x over 2. How do we know? Well if one line has a slope of m, then the line that's perpendicular would be the negative reciprocal of this. It would be negative 1 over m. So this first line has a slope of 1/2. Well what's the negative reciprocal of 1/2? Well the reciprocal of 1/2 is 2/1. and you make that negative. So it is equal to negative 2. So this slope is a negative reciprocal of this slope. So these lines are indeed-- I'm trying to erase that-- perpendicular. So we literally could drop a perpendicular, literally go along this line right over here, in our attempt to reflect. And we see that we're going down 2, over 1 twice. So let's go down 2, over 1, down 2, over 1, twice again. Let me do that in that same color. The reflection of this point, across y is equal to x/2 is this point right over there. So now we have three points of our quadrilateral. Let's see if we can get a fourth. So let's go to the magenta point. The magenta point we've already seen. It's sitting on top of y equals x/2, so trying to reflect it doesn't help us much, but we could try to reflect it across y is equal to negative 2x plus 5. So once again these lines are perpendicular to each other. Actually let me mark that off. These lines are perpendicular. So we can drop a perpendicular and try to find its reflection. So we're going to the right 2 and up 1. We're doing that once, twice, three times on the left side. So let's do that once, twice, three times on the right side. So the reflection is right there. We essentially want to go to that line. And however far we were to the left of it, we want to go that same, that bottom left direction, which you want to go in the same direction, to the top right, the same distance to get the reflection. So there you have it. There is our other point. So now we have the four points of this quadrilateral. Four points of this quadrilateral are-- or the four sides, let me actually just draw the quadrilateral. We have our four points. So this is one side right over here. This is one side, right over here. This is another side, right over here. And you can verify that these are parallel. How would you verify that they're parallel? Well they have the same slope. To get from this point to that point, you have to go over, so your run has to be 4, and you have to rise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So the slope here is 7/4. Rise over run, or change in y over change in x, is 7/4. And over here, you go 1, 2, 3, 4. So you run 4 and then you rise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So the slope here is also 7/4. So these two lines are going to be parallel. And then we could draw these lines over here. So this one at the top. The one at the top right over there. And what's its slope? Well, let's see. We go from x equals 0 to x equals 8. So we go down, our change in y is negative 1 every time we increase x by 8. So this is the slope of-- slope is equal to negative 1/8. And that's the exact same slope that we have right over here. Negative 1/8. So these two lines are parallel as well. This line is parallel to this line as well. So at minimum, we're dealing with a parallelogram. But let's see if we can get even more specific. Because this kind of looks like a rhombus. It looks like a parallelogram, where all four sides have the same length. So there's a couple of ways that you could verify that this parallelogram is a rhombus. One way is you could actually find the distance between the points. We know the coordinates, so you could use the distance formula, which really comes straight out of the Pythagorean theorem. Or even better, you could look at the diagonals of this rhombus-- we could look at the diagonals of this parallelogram. We are trying to figure out if it's a rhombus. And if the diagonals are perpendicular, then you're dealing with a rhombus. And we've already shown that these diagonals, that this diagonal, this diagonal, and this diagonal are perpendicular. They intersect at right angles. And so this must be a rhombus.",math_ab-sixth-grade-math_shape-space
" Welcome to level two linear equations. Let's do a problem. 2x plus 3 is equal to minus 15. Throw the minus in there to make it a little bit tougher. So the first thing we want to do whenever we do any linear equation, is we want to get all of the variable terms on one hand side of the equation and all the constant terms on the other side. And it doesn't really matter, although I tend to get my variables on the left hand side of the equation. Well, my variables are already on the left hand side of the equation but I have this plus 3 that I somehow want to move to the right hand side of the equation. And the way I can-- you can put it in quotes, move the 3 is I can subtract 3 from both sides of this equation. And look at that carefully as to why you think that works. Because if I subtract 3 from the left hand side, clearly this negative 3 that I'm subtracting and the original 3 will cancel out and become 0. and as long as I do whatever I do on the left hand side, as long as I do it on the right hand side as well, because whatever you do on one side of the equal side, you have to do to the other side, then I'm making a valid operation. So this will simplify to 2x, because the 3's cancel out. They become just 0. Equals minus 15 minus 3. Well, that's minus 18. And now, we're just at a level one problem, and you can just multiply both sides of this equation times the reciprocal on the coefficient of 2x. I mean, some people would just say that we're dividing by 2, which is essentially what we're doing. I like to always go with the reciprocal, because if this 2 was a fraction, it's easier to think about it that way. But either way, you either multiply by the reciprocal, or divide by the number. It's the same thing. So 1/2 times 2x. Well, that's just 1x. So you get x equals, and then minus 18/2. And minus 18/2, well, that just equals minus 9. Let's do another problem. And actually, well, if we wanted to check it, we could say, well, the original problem was 2x plus 3 equals minus 15. So we could say 2 times minus 9 plus 3. 2 times minus 9 is minus 18 plus 3. Well, that's equal to minus 15, which is equal to what the original equation said, so we know that's right. That's the neat thing about algebra. You can always check your work. Let's do another problem. I'm going to put some fractions in this time, just to show you that it can get a little bit hairy. So let's say I had minus 1/2x plus 3/4 is equal to 5/6. So we'll do the same thing. First, we just want to get this 3/4 out of the left hand side of the equation, and actually, if you want to try working this out yourself, you might want to pause the video and then play it once you're ready to see how I do it. Anyway, let me move forward assuming you haven't paused it. If we want to get rid of this 3/4, all we do is we subtract 3/4 from both sides of this equation. Minus 3/4. Well, the left hand side, the two 3/4 will just cancel. We get minus 1/2x equals, and then on the right hand side, we just have to do this fraction addition or fraction subtraction. So the least common multiple of 6 and 4 is 12. So this becomes 5/6 6 is 10/12 minus 3/4 is 9/12, so we get minus 1/2x is equal to 1/12. Hopefully, I didn't make a mistake over here. And if that step confused you, I went a little fast, you might just want to review the adding and subtraction of fractions. So going back to where we were. So now all we have to do is, well, the coefficient on the x term is minus 1/2, and this is now a level one problem. So to solve for x, we just multiply both sides by the reciprocal of this minus 1/2x, and that's minus 2/1 times minus 1/2x on that side, and then that's times minus 2/1. The left hand side, and you're used to this by now, simplifies to x. The right hand side becomes minus 2/12, and we could simplify that further to minus 1/6. Well, let's check that just to make sure we got it right. So let's try to remember that minus 1/6. So the original problem was minus 1/2x, so here we can substitute the minus 1/6, plus 3/4. I just wrote only the left hand side of the original problem. So minus 1/2 times minus 1/6, well, that's positive 1/12 plus 3/4. Well, that's the same thing as 12, the 1 stays the same, plus 9. 1 plus 9 is 10 over 12. And that is equal to 5/6, which is what our original problem was. Our original problem was this. This stuff I wrote later. So it's 5/6, so the problem checks out. So hopefully, you're now ready to try some level two problems on your own. I might add some other example problems. But the only extra step here relative to level one problems is you'll have this constant term that you need to add or subtract from both sides of this equation, and you'll essentially turn it into a level one problem. Have fun.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-simple-linear-equations-in-one-variable-icse
" -  What we're going to do in this video is start trying to divide by two-digit numbers. And as we'll see, this is a super important skill that a lot of the rest of mathematics will build off of, but it's also interesting 'cause it's a bit of an art. So let's just start by trying to compute what 186 divided by 31 is. And of course, we could also write this as 186 divided by 31. Pause the video, and see if you can figure it out. All right, now let's work through this together. I assumed you've given it a go at it. So I don't have my 31 times tables memorized, so I can't just immediately tell you the answer. But my brain tries to approximate these numbers so that my times tables knowledge does come in handy. For example, 31 is close to 30. And this is why I'm saying it's a bit of an art, but I'm saying, hey, look, this is pretty close to 30. And if I think about multiples of 30, well, those are just the multiples of three with an extra zero or the multiples of three times 10. So the multiples of 30 are 30, 60, 90. Instead of three times four is 12, 30 times four is 120, 150 instead of 15, 180 instead of 18 for 30 times six, and gee, this looks pretty close to 180. So this looks close to 30 times six. And if this is close to 30, well, maybe, maybe this is, maybe this is going to be six right over here. And I'm gonna put a question mark because then the natural thing to do is to actually try it out. Figure out what is six times 31? I'll put the question mark here again. Is this equal to six? Well, the art part is you've made a good, or we've made a good guess here. Now let's try to verify that maybe it is six, maybe it isn't. So let's multiply six, or let's multiple 31 times six. 31 times six, one times six is six, and then three times six, which is really 30 times six, is gonna be 180 right over here. So this is 186. So it all works out. 186 divided by 31 is indeed six. We can get rid of this question mark here. Let's do another example. So let me delete. Let me delete that as well. Let's say we want to figure out what 336 divided by 48 is equal to. So pause this video, and see if you can figure it out. So the way I would think about it, this thing right over here is close to 50, close to 50. And this thing, well, if you think about the multiples of 50, you have things like 300, which would be 50 times six. And then you have 350, which would be 50 times seven, because five times seven is 35. And so let's think about this, and actually let me write these things down. If I were to say 50 times six, that's the same thing as, well, that's gonna be five times six times 10, which is 300. If I say 50 times seven, that's going to be 350. Five times seven is 35, and then you're multiplying that by 10. But this number is someplace in between 300 and 350. So my candidates for what this is going to be, well, I'm saying, hey, maybe this is six, maybe this is seven. And what I would do is I would try out each of them. So let's try out 48 times six. So let's try that, this first candidate out. 48 times six, so eight times six is going to be 48. Four times six is 24, plus four is 288. So that actually seems a good bit lower than this. It actually seems almost exactly 48 lower. So I could probably, I'm feeling pretty confident that I can squeeze another 48 into this. So instead of squeezing, instead of being able to divide 6/48 into this, I'm feeling pretty good that maybe seven is the answer, but let me try it out. So this, so six is not going to be my answer, I tried it out. Let me try 48 times seven. 48 times seven, eight times seven is 56, four times seven is 28, plus three, 336. That's exactly right. So there you have it, with a little bit of trial and error, but it was an informed trial and error, we got 336 divided by 48 is equal to seven. This is what I meant, that it's a bit of an art.",math_cc-fifth-grade-math_multi-digit-multiplication-and-division
" - So, here is our given rectangle, and we want to draw a rectangle with the same area, the same area, so what is the area of this rectangle? Area is the amount of space a shape covers, so how much space, or how many square units does this shape cover, does our rectangle cover? Each of these is one square unit, so our rectangle covers one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight square units. It has an area of eight square units. So, we want to draw another rectangle that also covers eight square units. If it covers eight square units, than it has an area of eight square units, but we can't just draw the identical rectangle, because we're also told that it should have, our rectangle should have no side lengths the same, so what are the side lengths of our rectangle? Over here on the left, it's one unit long, and going across the top is eight units long. This rectangle had eight square units, and they were broken up into one row of eight, so we need to think of another way that we can break up eight square units. One idea would be two rows of four, 'cause two rows of four would also cover eight, so let's try that. Let's create a rectangle here, two rows of four, and we can just spread this out a little bit so it covers the whole square units, and so this rectangle also covers one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight square units, so the given rectangle, and our rectangle have the same area because they cover the same amount of space, but they have different side lengths, because our new rectangle is, has a side length of two over here on the side, it's two units long, and going across the top is four units long, so it has new side lengths, so here's one way that we could draw a rectangle with the same area, but different side lengths.",math_in-in-class-6-math-india-icse_in-in-6-perimeter-and-area-icse
" -  So I have written here the formal definition for the partial derivative of a two-variable function with respect to X, and what I wanna do is build up to the formal definition of the directional derivative of that same function in the direction of some vector V, and you know, V with the little thing on top, this will be some vector in the input space, and I have another video on the formal definition of the partial derivative if you want to check that out, and just to really quickly go through here, I've drawn this diagram before, but it's worth drawing again, if you think of your input space, which is the X Y plane, and you think of it somehow mapping over to the real number line, which is where your output F lives, and when you're taking the partial derivative at a point A B, you're looking over here and you say, maybe that's your point, some point A B, and you imagine nudging it slightly in the X direction, and saying, hey, how does that influence the function? So, maybe this is where A B lands, and maybe the result is a nudge that's a little bit negative. That would be a negative partial derivative, and you think of the size of that nudge as partial X, and the size of the resulting nudge in the output space as partial F. So, the way that you read this formal definition is you think of this variable H, you know, people, you could say delta X, but H seems to be the common variable people use, you think of it as that change in your input space, that slight nudge, and you look at how that influences the function when you only change the X component here, you know, you're only changing the X component with that nudge, and you say what's the change in F? What's that partial F? So, I'm gonna write this in a slightly different way, using vector notation. Instead I'm gonna say, you know, partial F, partial X, and instead of saying the input is A B, I'm gonna say it's a, you know, just A, and then make it clear that that's a vector, and this will be a two-dimensional vector, so I'll put that little arrow on top to indicate that it's a vector, and if we rewrite this definition, we'd be thinking the limit, as H goes to zero, of something divided by H, but that thing, now that we're writing in terms of vector notation, is gonna be F of, so it's gonna be our original starting point A, but plus what? I mean, up here, it was clear we could just add it to the first component, but if I'm not writing in terms of components, and I have to think in terms of vector addition, really what I'm adding is that H times the vector, the unit vector in the X direction, and it's common to use, you know, this little I with a hat to represent the unit vector in the X direction. So when I'm adding these, it's really the same. You know, this H is only gonna go to that first component, and the second component is multiplied by zero, and what we subtract off is the value of the function at that original input, that original two-dimensional input that I'm just thinking of as a vector here, and when I write it like this, it's actually much clearer how we might extend this idea to moving in different directions. 'Cause now, all of the information about what direction you're moving is captured with this vector here, what you multiply your nudge by as you're adding the input. So let's just rewrite that over here in the context of directional derivative. What you would say is that the directional derivative in the direction of some vector, any vector, of F, evaluated at a point, and we'll think about that input point as being a vector itself, A. Here, I'll get rid of this guy. It's also gonna be a limit, and as always, with these things, we think of some, not, I mean, always, but with derivatives, you think of some variable as going to zero, and then that's gonna be on the denominator, and the change in the function that we're looking for is gonna be F, evaluated at that initial input vector plus H, that scaling value, that little nudge of a value, multiplied by the vector whose direction we care about, and then you subtract off the value of F at that original input. So, this right here is the formal definition for the directional derivative, and you see how it's much easier to write in vector notation, because you're thinking of your input as a vector and your output as just some nudge by something. So, let's take a look at what that would feel like over here. You know, instead of thinking of D X and a nudge purely in the X direction, and I'll erase these guys, you would think of this point as being A, as being a vector valued A, so just to make clear how it's a vector, you'd be thinking of it starting at the origin, and the tip represents that point, and then H times V, you know, maybe V is some vector, often, you know, a direction that's neither purely X nor purely Y, but when you scale it down, it'll just be a tiny little nudge that's gonna be H, that tiny little value, scaling your vector V, so that tiny little nudge, and what you wonder is, hey, what's the resulting nudge to the output? And the ratio between the size of that resulting nudge to the output and the original guy there is your directional derivative, and more importantly, as you take the limit for that original nudge getting really really small, that's gonna be your directional derivative, and you can probably anticipate there's a way to interpret this as the slope of a graph. That's what I'm gonna talk about next video, but you actually have to be a little bit careful, because we call this the directional derivative, but notice, if you scale the value V by two, you know, if you go over here and you start plugging in two times V and seeing how that influences things, it'll be twice the change, because here, even if you're scaling by the same value H, it's gonna double the initial nudge that you had, and it's gonna double the resulting nudge out here, even though the denominator H doesn't stay changed. So when you're taking the ratio, what you're considering is the size of your initial nudge actually might be influenced. So, some authors, they'll actually change this definition, and they'll throw a little absolute value of the original vector, just to make sure that when you scale it by something else, it doesn't influence things, and you only care about the direction. But, I actually don't like that. I think there's some usefulness in the definition as it is right here, and that there's kind of a good interpretation to be had, for when, if you double the size of your vector, why that should double the size of your derivative, but I'll get to that in following videos. This right here is the formal definition to be thinking about, and I'll see you next video.",math_multivariable-calculus_multivariable-derivatives
" Divide x squared minus 3x plus 2 divided by x minus 2. So we're going to divide this into that. And we can do this really the same way that you first learned long division. So we have x minus 2 being divided into x squared minus 3x plus 2. Another way we could have written the same exact expression is x squared minus 3x plus 2, all of that over x minus 2. That, that, and that are all equivalent expressions. Now, to do this type of long division-- we can call it algebraic long division-- you want to look at the highest degree term on the x minus 2 and the highest degree term on the x squared minus 3x plus 2. And here's the x, and here's the x squared. x goes into x squared how many times? Or x squared divided by x is what? Well, that's just equal to x. So x goes into x squared x times. And I'm going to write it in this column right here above all of the x terms. And then we want to multiply x times x minus 2. That gives us-- x times x is x squared. x times negative 2 is negative 2x. And just like you first learned in long division, you want to subtract this from that. But that's completely the same as adding the opposite, or multiplying each of these terms by negative 1 and then adding. So let's multiply that times negative 1. And negative 2x times negative 1 is positive 2x. And now let's add. x squared minus x squared-- those cancel out. Negative 3x plus 2x-- that is negative x. And then we can bring down this 2 over here. So it's negative x plus 2 left over, when we only go x times. So then we say, can x minus 2 go into negative x plus 2? Well, x goes into negative x negative one times. You can look at it right here. Negative x divided by x is negative 1. These guys cancel out. Those guys cancel out. So negative 1 times x minus 2-- you have negative 1 times x, which is negative x. Negative 1 times negative 2 is positive 2. And we want to subtract this from that, just like you do in long division. But that's the same thing as adding the opposite, or multiplying each of these terms by negative 1 and then adding. So negative x times negative 1 is positive x. Positive 2 times negative 1 is negative 2. These guys cancel out, add up to 0. These guys add up to 0. We have no remainder. So we got this as being equal to x minus 1. And we can verify it. If we multiply x minus 1 times x minus 2, we should get this. So let's actually do that. So let's multiply x minus 1 times x minus 2. So let's multiply negative 2 times negative 1. That gives us positive 2. Negative 2 times x-- that's negative 2x. Let's multiply x times negative 1. That is negative x. And then x times x is x squared. And then add all the like terms. x squared, negative 2x minus x-- that's negative 3x. And then 2 plus nothing is just 2. And so we got that polynomial again.",math_algebra-home_alg-polynomials
"  Last video, we looked at how light from the sun can enter the eye-- and this is the eye. So it enters the eye, hits the back of the eye, and somehow through a set of steps, it gets converted into neural impulse. And the impulse gets sent to the brain for you to make sense of the information. So we looked at something called the retina in the last video. And we talked about how the retina is made up of a bunch of different cells. And the two main cells are rods and cones. So we're going to look at just the rods in this video. So the rod, which is shaped like this. Let's give him a little smiley face because he's happy. And what he does is that as soon as light is presented to him, he basically takes that light and then converts it into a neural impulse. So normally, he is turned on. When there's no light, the rod is turned on. But when light is present, it actually turns him off. So with light, he's turned off. So how does this happen? So this occurs through this thing called the phototransduction cascade.  So the phototransduction cascade is the set of steps that occurs at the molecular level that basically takes this rod and turns him off. And in turning him off, he's actually able to turn on a bunch of other cells that eventually lets the brain know, hey, there's light here. So it allows the brain to realize that there's light and allows it to comprehend what's going on make sense of the world. So let's go ahead and examine this phototransduction cascade. So let's give ourselves a little bit of space here, just look at it in a little bit more detail. So let's look at just a part of the rod. So I'm going to redraw the rod over here. And let's just look at this part of the rod, just this very top little bit of the rod. And I'm going to draw it a lot bigger, so that we can really make sense of what's going on here. So inside the rod, which we just made much bigger, there are a bunch of these little disks. So they are really thin little disks, and they're just stacked on top of one another, and there are hundreds of them. And basically they are like this. They just go stacked on top of one another, and they fill up the entire rod. Same thing with cones but we're just going to look at the rods here. So inside of these little disks, there are a whole bunch of different proteins all interspersed throughout the disks. So this protein that I'm drawing in red-- let me just go ahead and draw it a lot bigger, so we're going to go ahead and blow this protein up. And it's basically this multimeric protein, so it consists of a bunch of different subunits. There are actually seven subunits, so there are 5, 6, and 7. So there are all these subunits that make up this little protein right here. So this protein as a whole is called rhodopsin. And it's called rhodopsin because it's in a rod. If it were in a cone, it would be called cone opsin, but it's basically the same protein. And sitting inside of this protein is a small molecule, and it sits just inside. Let's go ahead and just zoom in a little bit, so we can make a little bit more sense of what we're looking at here. Let's go ahead and zoom in over here. So this little molecule is just sitting inside of rhodopsin, and it's kind of bent. You can see here how I drew it just a little bit bent. So this little molecule is called retinal.  And in this bent confirmation, we call it 11-cis retinal. And so what happens is light comes in from the sun, goes in through the pupil, hits the retina, and then hits this little rod. Some of the light will actually hit this molecule. So it'll hit rhodopsin, and it'll actually hit this molecule. So here's the light wave, it comes in, and it just hits the molecule right there. So an interesting thing happens when the light hits the molecule right at this region. And what it actually causes, is it causes the retinal to actually change confirmation. So the light provides enough energy that the retinal goes from this bent confirmation, and it causes it to look more like this. I'll draw it over here. I'll draw a little carbon ring, so it becomes straight. So it went from being bent to being straight. So the light does this, and basically goes from being 11-cis retinal to all-trans retinal. So when the retinal changes shape, it actually causes the rhodopsin molecule to also change shape. So the two are really closely linked, so when the retinal changes shape, the rhodopsin changes shape. So let's go ahead and pretend that maybe it looks like this. So this region that I'm shading in right here is what the new rhodopsin looks like after the retinal has changed shape after the light hit it. So rhodopsin now changes shape, and that basically begins this big cascade of events. So what happens next is there's a molecule-- and I'm going to draw that molecule right here in green-- and it's made up of three different parts. So there's this alpha subunit, there's a beta subunit, and there's a gamma subunit. And this molecule as a whole is called transducin.  So transducin, basically as soon as retinal changes shape and causes rhodopsin to change shape, transducin breaks away from rhodopsin. And the alpha subunit actually comes over here to another part of the disk and binds to a protein called phosphodiesterase, which I'll just draw as this little box over here. So this little protein is called cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, or PDE for short. So PDE, basically what it does-- let's go ahead and zoom out a little bit. What PDE does when it's activated is it takes cyclic GMP, which is floating all around the cell-- it's a little molecule, it's tiny-- and it basically takes the cyclic GMP and converts it into just regular GMP. So this basically reduces the concentration of cyclic GMP and increases the concentration of GMP. And the reason that this is important is because there's another channel over here, so there's a whole bunch of these sodium channels and they're all over the cell. So they're just a whole bunch of them, and basically what they let the cell do is they allow the cell to take in sodium from the outside. So let's just say there's a little sodium ion, and it allows it to come inside the cell. So in order for this sodium channel to be open, it actually needs cyclic GMP to be bound to it. So as long as cyclic GMP is bound, the channel is open. But as the concentration of cyclic GMP decreases because of the phosphodiesterase, it actually causes sodium channels to close. So now we have a closing of sodium channels, and now we basically have less sodium entering the cell. And as less sodium enters the cell, it actually causes the cell to hyperpolarize and turn off. So as the sodium channels close, it actually causes the rods to turn off.  So basically, without light, the rods are on because these sodium channels are open. Sodium is flowing through, and the rods are turned on. They can actually produce an action potential and activate the next cell and so on. But as soon as they're turned off, what happens is very interesting because-- let's just look at this rod over here. So what happens is really interesting, because there's this other cell over here that is called the bipolar cell. And we'll just give it a kind of a neutral base, because it's bipolar. This cell, there are actually two different variants, so there are on-center and there are off-center bipolar cells.  So the on-center bipolar cells normally are being turned off when this rod cell is turned on. But as we mentioned, due to the phototransduction cascade, the rods turn off, which actually turns on the bipolar cell. So basically, on-center bipolar cells get turned on with light and get turned off when there's no light. So that's how they get their names. So when the bipolar cell gets turned on, it activates a retinal ganglion cell, which then sends an axon to the optic nerve, and then into the brain. And so that process is known as the phototransduction cascade, and it basically allows your brain to recognize that there's light entering the eyeball.",science_health-and-medicine_nervous-system-and-sensory-infor
" Well now you've learned what I think is quite possibly one of the most useful concepts in life, and you might already be familiar with it, but if you're not this will hopefully keep you from one day filing for bankruptcy. So anyway, I will talk about interest, and then simple versus compound interest. So what's interest? We all have heard of it. Interest rates, or interest on your mortgage, or how much interest do I owe on my credit card. So interest-- I don't know what the actual formal definition, maybe I should look it up on Wikipedia-- but it's essentially rent on money. So it's money that you pay in order to keep money for some period of time. That's probably not the most obvious definition, but let me put it this way. Let's say that I want to borrow $100 from you. So this is now. And let's say that this is one year from now. One year. And this is you, and this is me. So now you give me $100. And then I have the $100 and a year goes by, and I have $100 here. And if I were to just give you that $100 back, you would have collected no rent. You would have just got your money back. You would have collected no interest. But if you said, Sal I'm willing to give you $100 now if you give me $110 a year later. So in this situation, how much did I pay you to keep that $100 for a year? Well I'm paying you $10 more, right? I'm returning the $100, and I'm returning another $10. And so this extra $10 that I'm returning to you is essentially the fee that I paid to be able to keep that money and do whatever I wanted with that money, and maybe save it, maybe invest it, do whatever for a year. And that $10 is essentially the interest. And a way that it's often calculated is a percentage of the original amount that I borrowed. And the original amount that I borrowed in fancy banker or fice terminology is just called principal. So in this case the rent on the money or the interest was $10. And if I wanted to do it as a percentage, I would say 10 over the principal-- over 100-- which is equal to 10%. So you might have said, hey Sal I'm willing to lend you $100 if you pay me 10% interest on it. So 10% of $100 was $10, so after a year I pay you $100, plus the 10%. And likewise. So for any amount of money, say you're willing to lend me any amount of money for a 10% interest. Well then if you were to lend me $1,000, then the interest would be 10% of that, which would be $100. So then after a year I would owe you $1,000 plus 10% times $1,000, and that's equal to $1,100. All right, I just added a zero to everything. In this case $100 would be the interest, but it would still be 10%. So let me now make a distinction between simple interest and compound interest. So we just did a fairly simple example where you lent money for me for a year at 10% percent, right? So let's say that someone were to say that my interest rate that they charge-- or the interest rate they charge to other people-- is-- well 10% is a good number-- 10% per year. And let's say the principal that I'm going to borrow from this person is $100. So my question to you-- and maybe you want to pause it after I pose it-- is how much do I owe in 10 years? How much do I owe in 10 years? So there's really two ways of thinking about it. You could say, OK in years at times zero-- like if I just borrowed the money, I just paid it back immediately, it'd be $100, right? I'm not going to do that, I'm going to keep it for at least a year. So after a year, just based on the example that we just did, I could add 10% of that amount to the $100, and I would then owe $110. And then after two years, I could add another 10% of the original principal, right? So every year I'm just adding $10. So in this case it would be $120, and in year three, I would owe $130. Essentially my rent per year to borrow this $100 is $10, right? Because I'm always taking 10% of the original amount. And after 10 years-- because each year I would have had to pay an extra $10 in interest-- after 10 years I would owe $200. Right? And that $200 is equal to $100 of principal, plus $100 of interest, because I paid $10 a year of interest. And this notion which I just did here, this is actually called simple interest. Which is essentially you take the original amount you borrowed, the interest rate, the amount, the fee that you pay every year is the interest rate times that original amount, and you just incrementally pay that every year. But if you think about it, you're actually paying a smaller and smaller percentage of what you owe going into that year. And maybe when I show you compound interest that will make sense. So this is one way to interpret 10% interest a year. Another way to interpret it is, OK, so in year zero it's $100 that you're borrowing, or if they handed the money, you say oh no, no, I don't want it and you just paid it back, you'd owe $100. After a year, you would essentially pay the $100 plus 10% of $100, right, which is $110. So that's $100, plus 10% of $100. Let me switch colors, because it's monotonous. Right, but I think this make sense to you. And this is where simple and compound interest starts to diverge. In the last situation we just kept adding 10% of the original $100. In compound interest now, we don't take 10% of the original amount. We now take 10% of this amount. So now we're going to take $110. You can almost view it as our new principal. This is how much we offer a year, and then we would reborrow it. So now we're going to owe $110 plus 10% times 110. You could actually undistribute the 110 out, and that's equal to 110 times 110. Actually 110 times 1.1. And actually I could rewrite it this way too. I could rewrite it as 100 times 1.1 squared, and that equals $121. And then in year two, this is my new principal-- this is $121-- this is my new principal. And now I have to in year three-- so this is year two. I'm taking more space, so this is year two. And now in year three, I'm going to have to pay the $121 that I owed at the end of year two, plus 10% times the amount of money I owed going into the year, $121. And so that's the same thing-- we could put parentheses around here-- so that's the same thing as 1 times 121 plus 0.1 times 121, so that's the same thing as 1.1 times 121. Or another way of viewing it, that's equal to our original principal times 1.1 to the third power. And if you keep doing this-- and I encourage you do it, because it'll really give you a hands-on sense-- at the end of 10 years, we will owe-- or you, I forgot who's borrowing from whom-- $100 times 1.1 to the 10th power. And what does that equal? Let me get my spreadsheet out. Let me just pick a random cell. So plus 100 times 1.1 to the 10th power. So $259 and some change. So it might seem like a very subtle distinction, but it ends up being a very big difference. When I compounded it 10% for 10 years using compound interest, I owe $259. When I did it using simple interest, I only owe $200. So that $59 was kind of the increment of how much more compound interest cost me. I'm about to run out of time, so I'll do a couple more examples in the next video, just you really get a deep understanding of how to do compound interest, how the exponents work, and what really is the difference. I'll see you in the next video.",economics-finance-domain_ap-macroeconomics_ap-financial-sector
" - You know, there's that saying that it takes a village to raise a kid. Well, I guess you could say that it takes an entire body, and I mean every single organ of a body, to make a baby. It's like the best example of teamwork that there is, all the organs in the body working together to support the growth and the development of the fetus, but also just as important, to make sure that mom's body isn't sacrificing its own needs to support the pregcy. So in order to accomplish that, pretty much every organ system undergoes a significant amount of change. And I wanna go through what those changes are. So let's start with the cardiovascular system, so the heart and the blood vessels throughout the body. And, I guess you could say, at the very basic, most essential, level, the body needs more blood to carry oxygen and those nutrients to the fetus. So the blood volume increases by something like 40 to 50 percent throughout the pregcy. And it's not just that there's more blood. The heart is also working harder to more efficiently supply that blood to the fetus. So, for example, the heart beats more quickly. It beats, like, 10 to 15 beats more each minute than usual. And the stroke volume, so the amount of blood that's pumped out with each heartbeat, increases, which means that the cardiac output, or the amount of blood that's pumped out of the heart each minute, also increases. So in summary, more blood is being pumped out of the heart to meet the demands of the fetus. So if you had to take a guess, what do you think happens to blood pressure during pregcy? I'm gonna guess that you guys guessed that it increases, because that's certainly what I thought happened. But it actually decreases. And it decreases for a couple of different reasons. Firstly, there's a lot of progesterone floating around in the blood during pregcy. And, if there's something that progesterone does really well, it relaxes smooth muscle. And that includes the smooth muscle that surrounds all of the blood vessels. So that relaxation causes dilation of the blood vessels, which then lowers the blood pressure. So that's a first cause, sort of, of the decrease in blood pressure through pregcy. The second thing that contributes to the lower blood pressure is the placenta, which is an addition of an entirely brand-new blood vessel circuit to the circulatory system. It's like when you add a resistor in parallel, reducing the resistance of the entire circuit. I'm just joking. That doesn't help anyone understand it any better. I guess you can think of it kind of, kind of as a tall apartment building and what would happen to the pressure in the shower heads if you added a whole additional floor of apartments, with shower heads that are really leaky and let out a lot of water. The placenta is kind of like that. It's a really low-resistance circuit. And also, while we're talking about the cardiovascular system, there's a syndrome that's called Supine, it's called Supine .. ""Supine"" means when you're lying on your back, Supine Postural, so it's Supine Postural, ""Postural"" meaning related to posture, Supine Postural Hypotensive Syndrome, so Supine Postural Hypotensive Syndrome. And it's weird that I'm talk about a syndrome in a video that's talking about physiology during pregcy. But I guess you could say, it's a syndrome, or something that goes wrong, due to normal pregcy physiology. So anyways, what it refers to is when, late in the course of a pregcy, the uterus becomes larger, right? And when the uterus becomes larger, it can compress the inferior vena cava. So that kind of looks like this. And since the inferior vena cava gathers the blood from the veins of the lower body and returns that blood to the heart, the compression of the inferior vena cava means that less blood is pushed back to the heart, meaning that less blood is pumped out with each heartbeat. And that leads to low blood pressure, or hypotension. Right? So that's where the ""Hypotensive"" in this name comes from. So the woman starts to feel light headed and like she's about to faint, especially when she's on her back, because that's the position, when she's on her back, that's the position in which the uterus is exerting the most pressure on the inferior vena cava. A really quick way to resolve that issue is for the woman to turn to her left side, and that tilts the uterus to the left and off of the inferior vena cava, allowing more blood to return to the heart. So that's all or most of the functional changes that occur with the cardiovascular system in pregcy. And the growing uterus also shifts the heart to the left a little, so there are also some anatomical changes, too. Now, I know that's a lot of information, but the cardiovascular system undergoes lots of changes to support the pregcy. So now let's move on to what changes occur in the respiratory system. So oxygen. Okay. Oxygen consumption increases in pregcy. Right? The fetus uses oxygen, the mom is using more oxygen to support all the changes in the body. So that means that mom's body needs to bring in more oxygen into the blood. And that's mostly done by increasing minute ventilation. It's mostly done by increasing minute ventilation, or the volume of air that's taken in each minute. And it's not that pregt ladies intentionally take deeper breaths, because that would get really uncomfortable very quickly. It's all that progesterone once again. So it's all that progesterone in the blood. And what that progesterone does is, it acts on the central respiratory centers in the brain to instruct the lungs to take in more air with each breath. So that's how you end up with more air being taken in with each breath during pregcy. And a quick thing that needs to be mentioned is that, when you have more air being inhaled with each breath, more carbon dioxide is being exhaled with each breath. Right? Does that make sense? And carbon dioxide is an acid. So in order to keep the pH of the blood balanced, the body responds to that decrease in carbon dioxide, so that decrease in an acid, by increasing the secretion of bicarbonate, which is a base, from the kidneys. So you have increased secretion of bicarbonate from the kidneys. So what you end up with is either normal or a very slightly alkalotic, so a slightly basic, blood pH. Okay. And lastly, there are a couple of anatomical changes, too. So, the enlarging uterus pushes the diaphragm upwards, almost four centimeters through the course of the pregcy. And that would really make it difficult to breathe. But the chest wall during pregcy is also more mobile, it's more flexible. And your chest wall circumference is larger. So that works to make up for that upward shift of the diaphragm. Okay, so let's finish off down here by discussing the changes that occur with the kidney. So two things. First thing, we said that there's an increase in blood volume during pregcy, right? And secondly, all of the arteries in the body are dilated during pregcy, including the ones that supply the kidney. So if you add those two things up, you end up with having more blood flow to the kidney. And what that means is, you end up with an increase in the rate of filtration of blood through the kidney. It's kind of like, you know those water filters that you can attach directly to your faucet? Right? Imagine if you had one of those. And if your pipes and your faucet got much larger, they got much wider, and there's more water running through the pipes, the rate at which the water was being filtered through the water filter would increase drastically. Well, this is the exact same thing. The kidney is just like your water filter in that it filters all of your blood. Now, with regards to the bladder, there is a contentious topic of whether the bladder holds more or less urine in a pregt woman. There's some thought that progesterone, which, remember, causes relaxation of smooth muscle, relaxes and increases the capacity of the bladder. And then there's other thought that the pressure of the uterus, the large uterus on the bladder, decreases the capacity of the bladder. So we're not entirely sure. But one thing is certain, and that is that pregt women definitely urinate more frequently than normal. And that has to do with increased urine production, as well as that pressure on the bladder from the uterus. And that pressure from the uterus also leads to dilatation of the ureter. So the ureters become dilated. And that's really important. And it kind of looks like this, where the pressure from the larger uterus causes the ureters to become wider, to become dilated. And that uterus putting pressure here sort of acts as a road block. And urine builds up in the ureters behind that road block. That built-up stagt urine acts as a medium for bacterial growth, right? Because we know urinary stasis is a risk factor for bacterial growth. And that's perhaps why pregt women are more susceptible to developing pyelonephritis, 1or infection of the kidney, 1than are non-pregt women. 1It's because of that urinary stasis 1that occurs as a result of the large uterus 1putting pressure on the ureters. 1All right. So those are some 1of the physiologic changes that occur in pregcy, 1with the cardiovascular system, 1the respiratory system, and the renal system.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
"  For any certain task, what we're going to have is a noise threshold. So, we're going to a have a noise distribution, and the noise distribution might kind of look something like this. So, this is just background noise. So, what this basically shows is if we were to take a bunch of individuals, and we showed them a bunch, we experimentally tested signal detection theory, you would get this graph, just kind of indicating the noise, and then we'd get a second graph, which is kind of shifted over to the right a little bit, and this is the signal distribution. So, this is the signal distribution, and in the blue over here, we have the noise distribution. So, the difference between the means of these two distributions is d-prime. So, if the signal distribution was shifted over here to the right, then d-prime would be really big. It would be a really easy task. It would be something kind of like this, whether there is a green dot on the screen or not. But, on the other hand, if the signal distribution were shifted over to the left, then d-prime would be super small, and it'd be something more like this, like the more difficult task. So, the x-axis, here we have the intensity of the stimulus. So, that would be how easy the stimulus is to distinguish from the background. Okay, so, we've got the first variable, which is d-prime, and the second variable is C, and that is the strategy of the individual. So, strategy can actually be, strategy can be expressed via the choice of the threshold. So, what does the individual deem as necessary? What threshold is necessary to surpass, in order for them to say yes versus no? So, we're just going to label the different strategies. So, there's B, there's D, there's C, and there's beta. So, these are different strategies, and they're just variables given to the different strategies. So, if we were to use this B strategy, this would basically say, okay, I'm going to choose a certain threshold. So, let's say that I choose this threshold over here. So, let's say that I choose two. So, anything that is greater than two, I will say yes to, and anything that is less than two, I will say no to. So, in that case, the probability of a hit is this area over here, and the probability of a false alarm is this area over here. So, that would be the B strategy. The D strategy basically says, okay, so the position of my threshold is going to be relative to the signal distribution. So, basically what that comes out to be is d-prime. So, the signal distribution, if it's over to the right, will have a big d-prime, so d-prime minus B. So, we choose a threshold, let's say two, and let's say that d-prime in this example is one, then we would have two minus one, and we'd get one. So, if we were using the D strategy, then anything above a one would get a yes, anything below would get a no. So, the C strategy would be an ideal observer. So, this would be someone that would be minimizing the possibility of a miss and of a false alarm. So, the C strategy is basically, if we were to write an equation for it, it would be B minus d-prime over two. So, in our example it would be two minus one divided by two, so that is equal to one point five. So, if you were using a C strategy, that of an ideal observer, then we would say anything above one point five would get a yes, anything below would get a no. And so, we said over here that the C variable is indicative of the strategy that a person uses. So, when C equals zero, then the participant is an ideal observer. If C is less than one, we say that the participant is liberal, and if C is greater than one, we say the participant is conservative in their strategy. And this would be ideal. So, when we say conservative, that means that they respond, no, more often than an ideal observer, and when we say liberal, then that means that the participant says no less often than the ideal observer. So, the final variable that we have to talk about is beta. So, if we're using this beta virtue, we accept the value of the threshold equal to the ratio of the height of the signal distribution to the height of the noise distribution. And so, it's easier to actually look at beta in this way. So, if we were actually writing an equation, we would say the natural log of beta is equal to d-prime times C. And so, in this case, it would equal one times one point five, which equals one point five.",science_health-and-medicine_nervous-system-and-sensory-infor
" -  We are told researchers scored 31 athletes on an agility test. Here are their scores. It's in this histogram. And what I'm going to ask you is, which of these intervals, interval A, B, or C, which one contains the median of the scores, and which one, or give an estimate which one contains the mean of the scores. Pause this video and see if you can figure that out. So let's just start with the median. Remember, the median you could view as the middle number, or if you have an even number of data points, it would be the average of the middle two. Here we have an odd number of data points, so it would be the middle number. So what would be the middle number if you were to order them from least to greatest? Well, it would be the one that has 15 on either side, so it would be the 16th data point. 16th data point. And so we could just think about which interval here contains the 16th data point. You could view it for the 16th from the highest or the 16th from the lowest. It is the middle one. All right, so let's start from the highest. So this interval C contains the 13 highest data points and then interval B goes from the 14th highest all the way to the 18th highest. So this B contains the median. It contains the 16th highest data point, or if you started from the left, it would also be the 16th lowest data point. So that's where the median is. The median. Now what about an estimate for the mean? Well, you have calculated the mean in the past, but when you're looking at a distribution like this, when you're looking at a histogram, one way to think about the mean is it would be the balancing point. If you imagine that this histogram was made out of some material of, let's say, uniform density, where would you put a fulcrum in order to balance it? If you put the fulcrum right over here, it feels like you would tip over to the left because this is a left-skewed distribution. You have this long tail to the left. If you really wanted to balance it out, it seems like you would have to move your fulcrum in that direction of that left skew, in the direction of the tail. And so I would estimate to balance it out, it would actually be closer to that, which would be interval A. Interval A would contain the mean. The intention of this type of exercise isn't for you to try to calculate every data point, in fact, they don't give you all of the information here, and add them all up and then divide by 31. It's really to estimate and to also get the intuition that when you have a left-skewed distribution like this, you will often see a situation where your mean is to the left of the median. If you have a right-skewed distribution, it would be the other way around. And as we will see, when we see a symmetric distribution, the mean and the median will be awfully close to each other, or when you have a roughly symmetric distribution. If you have a perfectly symmetric distribution, they might be exactly in the same place. So let's do another example. So here it says we have the ages of 14 coworkers, and I want you to do is say roughly where is the mean and roughly where is the median? Is it roughly at A, is it roughly at B, or its it roughly at C? Pause this video and try to figure it out. So let's first start off with the median. We have 14 data points. So this would be the average of the middle two data points. It would be the average of the seventh and eighth data point. Well, you could say one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and then the eighth one is here. So the seventh data point is a 30. The eighth one is in the 31 bucket. So the average of the two would get you to B. Another way that you could think about it is you can just eyeball it and see you have just as many data points below B as you do have above B, and so that also gives you a good indication that B would be where the median is. So that is where the median is. Now what about the mean? Well, this is a perfectly symmetric distribution. If I wanted to balance it, I would put the fulcrum right in the middle. So I would say that the mean would also, the mean would also be at B, and we are done.",math_ap-statistics_summarizing-quantitative-data-ap
" -  So we saw in previous videos that a ball of mass m rotating in a circle of radius r at a speed v has what we call angular momentum, and the symbol we use for angular momentum is a capital L, and the amount of angular momentum that it would have would be the mass of the ball times the speed of the ball, so that means this is basically just the magnitude of the momentum, but then we multiply by the radius of the circle it's traveling in, and that gives us the angular momentum of this ball going in a circle, which is great and good to know, but sometimes you don't have a ball going in a circle and you wanna know the angular momentum. So, for instance, instead of this case, let's say you have this case, where instead of a ball going around in a circle, you've got a rod of mass m and radius R and the whole rod rotates around in a circle. Let's say the outside edge travels at a speed v just like the ball did. So the question is, will this rod also have an angular momentum that's equal to mvR and it won't. You can probably convince yourself of that because for the ball all the mass was traveling at a speed v and all the mass was at the outside edge of the circle that it traces out. In other words, all this mass is traveling at a radius of R. But for this rod, some of the mass, in fact, only part of the mass, only this outside edge of the mass, is actually traveling at a radius R. That's the part that travels at the full radius R. The rest of these pieces of mass, like this one in here, traces out a circle. It definitely traces out a circle, but the circle it traces out is not equal to the radius R. It's got a diminished R value. So how do we determine the angular momentum of an object whose mass is distributed in a way that some of the mass is close to the axis and some of the mass is far away from the axis. That's what we're gonna do in this video. That's the goal and the approach physicists take to this is almost always the same. We say, well, I've got the formula for the angular momentum of a single particle traveling at a single radius, so let's just imagine our continuous object being composed of a bunch of single masses all traveling at a single radius. So if I break this continuous mass up into individual pieces, right? So if I imagine it being broken up into all these little pieces, then if I found the angular momentum of each piece and added it up, I'd get the total angular momentum for the whole object. So let's try this. So the angular momentum of some piece of the object, let's say that little piece of mass, is gonna be, well the mass of that little piece, I'm gonna write m. It's not the entire mass of this entire rod, it'd just be the mass of that small piece times the speed of that piece times the radius that it is at. So to make this clear, let me just write this as like piece one, so this would be m1, v1 and R1 and this would be the angular momentum of that small piece, and you could do this for mass two over here, and you would get that the angular momentum of mass two would be m2, v2 and R2. Now keep in mind that these v's are all gonna be different so the speed out here at the outside edge is gonna be fastest. This speed's not gonna be as great, and this speed closer to the middle is even smaller because they're tracing out smaller circles in the same amount of time as these outside pieces trace out larger circles in the same amount of time. So at this point, you might be worried. You might be like, ""This is gonna be really hard. We're gonna have to add all these up. They've all got different speeds. They're all at different radii. How are we gonna do this?"" Well, you gotta have faith and something magical is about to happen. So let me show you what happens if we imagine adding all these up. I only draw two. You gotta imagine there's an infinite amount of these so that makes it seem even harder, but imagine breaking this up into an infinite amount of these little discrete masses and considering each individual angular momentum, they'd be very small because this m1 would be an infinitesimal very small piece of mass, and let's add them all up and see what we get. So if we add up all of the mvR's of every piece of mass on this rod, that would be the total angular momentum of the rod. So in other words, this is really just m1, v1, R1 m2, v2, R2 and so on. You'd have an infinite amount of them, right? I can't write them all out 'cause there's an infinite amount. But just imagine that. So what can we possibly do with this? How do we clean this up? When you're doing a physics problem, you don't want to solve an infinite series by writing each term out infinitely. We want a clever way to deal with this, and there's a really clever way to deal with this. Watch this. So if we write this as L equals the sum of mvR. One problem we have is that each mass has a different v. If I can pull things out of this summation, it would help me out 'cause it would simplify things. I could just factor them out, but right now I can't factor out the R, 'cause these all are different radii from the axis. You always measure your radius from the axis here, and they're all at different radii from the axis, and they all have different speeds. But, remember, we like writing quantities in terms of angular variables because the angular variables are the same for every point on this mass. So every point on this rotating rod has a different speed v but they all have the same angular speed omega, so that's a key. That's often what we do and we're gonna do that here. I'm gonna write this as summation of m, but instead of writing v, I'm gonna write this as R times omega. So, remember, for something rotating in the circle, the speed v is gonna be equal to R times omega and that's what I'm gonna substitute down here, so the speed at any point here is the radii of that point times the angular speed of this rod rotating in a circle, and I still have to multiply by the last R here, so this was v. We substituted in what v was, but we have to multiply by R and what do we get? We get that L is gonna be the summation of mR squared omega. And this is great. The omega is the same for every single mass in here. Every single mass travels at the same angular speed, so we could factor this out of the summation. Imagine all these terms would have an omega. We can factor that out, and I could just bring that outside of the summation. So I'll write this as the summation of mR squared, and to make this clear, I'm gonna put parentheses here. It's that summation and then that whole thing times omega, 'cause we're just factoring out omega. And you might not be impressed. You might be like, ""All right. Big deal. We've still got an infinite sum in here. What the heck am I gonna do with that?"" You don't have to do anything with that. This is where the magic happens. Look at what sum you've got. You've got the sum of all the mR squareds. Remember what mR squared was? Mr squared was the moment of inertia of a point mass, and if I add up all the mR squareds, I get the moment of inertia of the entire mass, this entire object. I get its total moment of inertia. So what we found was a really handy way to write the angular momentum of an object. It's just the moment of inertia of an object, I, times the angular speed of that object. So this is a great formula, and it totally makes sense for this reason. Think about regular momentum, right. Regular momentum, p, was just equal to mv. Well, if you then told me, ""Determine the angular momentum,"" and I didn't wanna go through this derivation, I mighta just been like, ""All right, angular momentum, shoot."" Well, I'm just gonna replace mass with angular mass, and angular mass, the angular inertia, is just the moment of inertia, and I'll just replace the speed with the angular speed, and look, I just get this formula. So it makes sense because if you replace all the linear quantities with their angular counterpart, you indeed just get the angular momentum of a rotating object. So this is how you do it. If you've got an object, an extended object where the mass is distributed about the entire object, if you just take the moment of inertia of that object and multiply by its angular speed, you get its angular momentum. So, for instance, if this rod has a mass of let's say three kilograms, and that mass is evenly distributed. Let's say the radius of this object is two meters. So that's the distance from the axis to the outside edge. And let's say the angular speed of this object was, let's say 10 radians per second, we can figure out the angular momentum of this rod by saying that the angular momentum is gonna equal the moment of inertia. Well the moment of inertia of a rod about one end is equal to 1/3 mL squared. That's the moment of inertia of a rod about the end, and I then multiply by the angular speed of the object. So if I plug in numbers, I get the angular momentum of this rod is gonna be, I'll use purple here, 1/3 times three kilograms times the length of the object was two meters, and we square that, and then we multiply by the angular speed and that was 10 radians per second, which give us an angular momentum of 40 kilogram meters squared per second. So recapping, if you've got a point mass where all the mass rotates at the same radius and you wanna find the angular momentum, the easiest way to get it is probably with the formula mvR. However, if you have a mass whose mass is distributed throughout the object so that different points on the object are at different radii, the easiest way to get the angular momentum of that object is most likely with the formula I omega, where I is the moment of inertia of the object and omega is the angular velocity of the object.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-system-of-particles-and-rotational-motion
" In the first video on evolution, I drew something that I called an ape. And then I drew a tail on it. And what I want to do in this video is clarify that that was absolutely wrong. Apes have no tails. And it's actually one of the main distinguishing characteristics of apes. There's obviously other primates that also have no tails. But apes definitely have no tails. And just to clarify, there's kind of two families within apes. And their common names are the lesser apes and the great apes. And the lesser apes are things like gibbons. And the great apes are things like chimpanzees, and gorillas, and me, human beings. So these right here, these are the great apes.

" Simplify the rational expression and state the domain. Let's see if we can start with the domain part of the question, if we can start with stating the domain. Now, the domain is the set of all of the x values that you can legitimately input into this if you view this as a function, if you said this is f of x is equal to that. The domain is a set of all x values that you could input into this function and get something that is well-defined. The one x value that would make this undefined is the x value that would make the denominator equal 0-- the x value that would make that equal 0. So when does that happen? Six minus x is equal to 0. Let's add x to both sides. We get 6 is equal to x, so the domain of this function is equal to the set of all real numbers except 6. So, x could be all real numbers except 6, because if x is 6 then you're dividing by 0, and then this expression is undefined. We've stated the domain, now let's do the simplifying the rational expression. Let me rewrite it over here. We have x squared minus 36 over 6 minus x. Now, this might jump out at you immediately, as it's that special type of binomial. It's of the form a squared minus b squared, and we've seen this multiple times. This is equivalent to a plus b times a minus b. And in this case, a is x and b is 6. This top expression right here can be factored as x plus 6 times x minus 6, all of that over 6 minus x. Now, at first you might say, I have a x minus 6 and a 6 minus x. Those aren't quite equal, but what maybe will jump out at you is that these are the negatives of each other. Try it out. Let's multiply by negative 1 and then by negative 1 again. Think of it that way. If I multiply by negative 1 times negative 1, obviously, I'm just multiplying the numerator by 1, so I'm not in any way changing the numerator. What happens if we just multiply the x minus 6 by that first negative 1? What happens to that x minus 6? Let me rewrite the whole expression. We have x plus 6, and I'm going to distribute this negative 1. If I distribute the negative 1, I have negative 1 times x is negative x. Negative 1 times negative 6 is plus 6. And then I have a negative 1 out here. I have a negative 1 times negative 1, and all of that is over 6 minus x. Now, negative plus 6. This is the exact same thing as 6 minus x if you just rearrange the two terms. Negative x plus 6 is the same thing as 6 plus negative x, or 6 minus x. Now you could cancel them out. 6 minus x divided by 6 minus x, and all you're left with is a negative 1-- I'll write it out front-- times x plus 6. If you want, you can distribute it and you would get negative x minus 6. That's the simplified rational expression. In general, you don't have to go through this exercise, multiplying by a negative 1 and a negative 1. But you should always be able recognize that if you have a minus b over b minus a that that is equal to negative 1. Or think of it this way: a minus b is equal to the negative of b minus a. If you distribute this negative sign, you get negative b plus a, which is exactly what this is over here. We're all done.",math_algebra-home_alg-rational-expr-eq-func
" A lot of what we do with Laplace transforms, taking them and taking their inverse, it's a lot of pattern matching. And it shouldn't just be a mechanical thing, and that's why I've gone through the exercise of showing you why they work. But in order to just kind of make sure we don't get confused, I think it might be useful to review a little bit of everything that we've learned so far. So in the last video, we saw that the Laplace transform-- well, let me just write something. The Laplace transform of f of t, let me just get some notation down, and we can write that as big capital F of s, and I've told you that before. And so given that, in the last video I showed you that if we have to deal with the unit step function, so if I said, look, the Laplace transform of the unit step function, it becomes 1 at some value c times some shifted function f of t minus c, in the last video, we saw that this is just equal to e to the minus cs times the Laplace transform of just this function right there, so times the F of s. And it's really important not to get this confused with another Laplace transform property or rule, or whatever you want to call it, that we figured out. I think it was one of the videos that I made last year, but if you're just following these in order I think it's three or four videos ago. And that one told us that the Laplace transform of e to the at, times f of t, that this is equal to-- and I want to make this distinction very clear. Here we shifted the f of t and we got just kind of a regular F of s. In this situation, when we multiply it times a e to the positive at, we end up shifting the actual transform. So this becomes F of s minus a. And these two rules, or properties, or whatever you want to call them, they're very easy to confuse with each other. So we're going to do a couple of examples that we're going to have to figure out which one of these two apply. Let's write all the other stuff that we learned as well. The very first thing we learned was that the Laplace transform of 1 was equal to 1/s. We know that that's a pretty straightforward one, easy to prove to yourself. And more generally, we learned that the Laplace transform of t to the n, where n is a positive integer, it equaled n factorial over s to the n plus 1. And then we had our trig functions that we've gone over. Let me do this in a different color. I'll do it right here. The Laplace transform of sine of at is equal to a over s squared, plus a squared. And the Laplace transform of the cosine of at is equal to s over s squared plus a squared. And you'll be amazed by how far we can go with just what I've written here. In future videos, we're going to broaden our toolkit even further, but just these right here, you can already do a whole set of Laplace transforms and inverse Laplace transforms. So let's try to do a few. So let's say I were to give you the Laplace transform. And you know, this is just the hard part. I think you know how to solve a differential equation, if you know how to take the Laplace transforms and go back and forth. The hard part is just recognizing or inverting your Laplace transforms. So let's say we had the Laplace transform of some function F of s. Let's say it's 3 factorial over s minus 2 to the fourth. Now, your pattern matching, or your pattern recognition part of your brain, should immediately say, look, I have a Laplace transform of something that has a factorial in it, and it's over an exponent. This must be something related to this thing right here, right? If I just had the Laplace transform-- let me write that down-- the Laplace transform of-- you see a 3 factorial and a fourth power, so it looks like n is equal to 3. So if you write the Laplace transform of t to the 3, this rule that we showed right here, this means that it would be equal to 3 factorial over s to the fourth. Now, this thing isn't exactly this thing. They're not quite the same thing. You know, I'm doing this to instruct you, but I find these, when I'm actually doing them on an exam-- I remember when I did them when I first learned this, I would actually go through this step because you definitely don't want to make a careless mistake and you definitely want to make sure you have a good handle on what you're doing. So you're like, OK, it's something related to this, but what's the difference between this expression right here and the expression that we're trying to take the inverse Laplace transform of, and this one here? Well, we've shifted our s. If we call this expression right here F of s, then what's this expression? This expression right here is F of s minus 2. So what are we dealing with here? So you see here, you have a shifted F of s. So in this case, a would be equal to 2. So this is the Laplace transform of e to the at times our f of t. So let me write this down. This is the Laplace transform of e to the-- and what's a? a is what we shifted by. It's what we shifted by minus a, so you have a positive a, so e to the 2t times the actual function. If this was just an F of s, what would f of t be? Well, we figured out, it's t the 3, t to the third power. So the Laplace transform of this is equal to that. Or we could write that the inverse Laplace transform of 3 factorial over s minus 2 to the fourth is equal to e to the 2t times t to the third. Now, if that seemed confusing to you, you can kind of go forward. Let's go the other direction, and maybe this will make it a little bit clearer for you. So let's go from this direction. If I have to take the Laplace transform of this thing, I'd say, OK, well, the Laplace transform of t to the third is easy. I think the tool isn't working right there properly. Let me scroll up a little bit. So I could write it right here. So if I wanted to figure out the Laplace transform of e to the 2t times t to the third, I'll say, well, you know, this e to the 2t, I remember that it shifts something. So if I know that the Laplace transform of t the third, this is an easy one. It's equal to 3 factorial over s to the fourth. That's 3 plus 1. Then the Laplace transform of e to the 2t times t the third is going to be this shifted. This is equal to F of s. Then this is going to be f of s minus 2. So what's F of s minus 2? It's going to be equal to 3 factorial over s minus 2 to the fourth. I think you're already getting an appreciation that the hardest thing about these Laplace transform problems are really kind of all of these shifts and kind of recognizing the patterns and recognizing what's your a, and what's your c, and being very careful about it so you don't make a careless mistake. And I think doing a lot of examples probably helps a lot, so let's do a couple of more to kind of make sure things really get hammered home in your brain. So let's try this one right here. This looks a little bit more complicated. They give us that the Laplace transform of some function is equal to 2 times s minus 1 times e to the minus 2s, all of that over s squared minus 2s plus 2. Now this looks very daunting. How do you do this? I have an e here. I have something shifted here. I have this polynomial in the denominator here. What can I do with this? So the first thing, when I look at these polynomials in the denominator, I say can I factor it somehow? Can I factor it fairly simply? And actually, in the exams that you'll find in differential equation class, they'll never give you something that's factorable into these weird numbers. It tends to be integers. So you see, OK, what two numbers? They have to be positive. When you give their product, you get 2. And then when you add them, you get negative 2, or they could both be negative. But there's no two easy numbers, not 1 and 2. None of those work. So if you can't factor this outright, the next idea is maybe we could complete the square and maybe this will match one of the cosine or the sine formulas. So how can we complete the square in this denominator? Well, this can be rewritten as s squared minus 2s. And I'm going to put a plus 2 out here. And you can watch, I have a bunch of videos on the completing of the square, if all of this looks foreign to you. And to complete the square, we just want to turn this into a perfect square. So to turn this into a perfect square-- so something when I add it to itself twice becomes minus 2, and so that when I square it, when I add it to itself twice, it becomes minus 12, it's minus 1. 1And when I square it, it'll become plus 1. 1I can't just add plus 1 arbitrarily to some 1expression, I have to make it neutral. 1So let me subtract 1. 1I haven't changed this. 1I added 1 and I subtracted 1. 1A little bit of a primer on completing the square. 1But by doing this, I now can call this expression right 1here, I can now say that this thing is s minus 1 squared. 1And then this stuff out here, this out here is 2 minus 1. 1This is just plus 1. 1So I can rewrite my entire expression now as 2 times s 1minus 1 times e to the minus 2s-- make sure I'm not 1clipping off at the top-- e to the minus 2s, all of that over 1s minus 1 squared plus 1. 1So a couple of interesting things seem to 1be happening here. 1Let's just do a couple of test Laplace transforms. So if a 1Laplace transform of cosine of t, we know that this is equal 1to s over s squared plus 1, which this kind of looks like 1if this was an s and this was an s squared plus 1. 1If this was F of s, then what is this? 1Well, let's ignore this guy right here for a little bit. 1So what is it? 1We know, actually, from the last video. 1We saw, well, what if we took the Laplace transform of e to 1the-- I'll call it 1t. 1But let's say e to the-- yeah I'll just write it e to the 1t 1times cosine of t? 1Well, then this will just shift this Laplace 1transform by 1. 1It will shift it by 1 to the right. 1Wherever you see an s, you would put an s minus a 1. 1So this will be equal to s minus 1 over s minus 1 1squared plus 1. 1We're getting close. 1We now figured out this part right here. 1Now, in the previous video, I think it was two videos ago, 1or maybe it was the last video, I forget. 1Memory fails me. 1I showed you that if you have the Laplace transform of the 1unit step function of t times some f of t shifted by some 1value of c, then that this is equal to e to the minus cs 1times F of s. 1OK, And this can get very confusing. 1This can get very confusing, so I want to be 1very careful here. 1Let's ignore all of this. 1I called this F of s before, but now I'm going to backtrack 1a little bit. 1And let's just ignore this, because I'm going to redefine 1our F of s. 1So let's just ignore that for a second. 1Let's define our new f of t to be this. 1Let's say that that is f of t. 1Let's say f of t is equal to e to the t cosine of t. 1Then if you take the Laplace transform of that, that means 1that F of s is equal to s minus 1 over s minus 1 1squared plus 1. 1Nothing fancy there. 1I just defined our f of t as this, and then 1our F of s is that. 1Now, we have a situation here. 1Let's ignore the 2 here. 1The 2 is just kind of a scaling factor. 1This expression right here, we can rewrite as that expression 1is equal to-- this is our F of s. 1This expression right here is equal to 2 times our F of s 1times e to the minus 2s. 1Or let me just write it. 1Let me switch the order, just so we make it look right. 12 times e to the minus 2s times F of s. 1Well, that looks just like this if our 2 was 1equal to our c. 1So what does that tell us? 1That tells us that the inverse Laplace transform, if we take 1the inverse Laplace transform-- and 1let's ignore the 2. 1Let's do the inverse Laplace transform of the whole thing. 1The inverse Laplace transform of this thing is going to be 1equal to-- we can just write the 2 there as a scaling 1factor, 2 there times this thing times 1the unit step function. 1What's our c? 1You can just pattern match. 1You have a 2 here. 1You have a c, a minus c, a minus 2, so c is 2. 1The unit step function is zero until it gets to 2 times t, or 1of t, so, then it becomes 1 after t is equal to 2, times 1our function shifted by 2. 1So this is our inverse Laplace transform. 1Now, what was our function? 1Our function was this thing right here. 1So if our inverse Laplace transform of that thing that I 1had written is this thing, an f of t, f of t is equal to e 1to the t cosine of t. 1Then our inverse-- let me write all of this down. 1Let me write our big result. 1We established that the inverse Laplace transform of 1that big thing that I had written before, 2 times s 1minus 1 times e to the minus 2-- sorry, e to the minus 2s 1over s squared minus 2s plus 2 is equal to this thing where f 1of t is this. 1Or we could just rewrite this as 2 times the unit step 1function starting at 2, where that's when it becomes 1non-zero of t times f of t minus 2. f of t minus 2 is 1this with t being replaced by t minus 2. 1I'll do it in another color, just to ease the monotony. 1So it would be e to the t minus 2 cosine of t minus 2. 1Now, you might be thinking, Sal, you know, he must have 1taken all these baby steps with this problem, because 1he's trying to explain it to me. 1But I'm taking baby steps with this problem so that I myself 1don't get confused. 1And I think it's essential that you do 1take these baby steps. 1And let's just think about what baby steps we took. 1And I really want to review this. 1This is actually a surprisingly good problem. 1I didn't realize it when I first decided to do it. 1We solved this thing. 1We wanted to get this denominator into some form 1that is vaguely useful to us, so I completed the square 1there and then we rewrote our Laplace transform, 1our f of s like this. 1And then we used a little pattern recognition. 1We said, look, if I take the Laplace transform of cosine of 1t, I'd get s over s squared plus 1. 1But this isn't s over s squared plus 1. 1It's s minus 1 over s minus 1 squared plus 1. 1So we said, oh, well, that means that we're multiplying 1our original time domain function. 1We're multiplying our f of t times e to the 1t. 1And that's what we got there. 1So the Laplace transform of e to the t cosine of t became s 1minus 1 over s minus 1 squared plus 1. 1And then we had this e to the minus 2s this entire time. 1And that's where we said, hey, if we have e to the minus 2s 1in our Laplace transform, when you take the inverse Laplace 1transform, it must be the step function times the shifted 1version of that function. 1And that's why I was very careful. 1And you had this 2 hanging out the whole time, and I could 1have used that any time. 1But the simple constants just scale. 1A function is equal to two times the Laplace transform of 1that function and vice versa. 1So the 2's are very easy to deal with, so I kind of 1ignored that most of the time. 1But that's why I was very careful. 1I redefined f of t to be this, F of s to be this, and said, 1gee, if F of s is this, and if I'm multiplying it times e to 1the minus 2s, then what I'm essentially doing, I'm fitting 1this pattern right here. 1And so the answer to my problem is going to be the 1unit step function-- I just throw the 2 out there-- the 2 1times the unit step function times my f of t shifted by c. 1And we established this was our f of t, so we just 1shifted it by c. 1We shifted it by 2, and we got our final answer. 1So this is about as hard up to this point as you'll see an 1inverse Laplace transform problem. 1So, hopefully, you found that pretty interesting.",math_differential-equations_laplace-transform
" Let's see if we can find the cube root of 3,430. And if you're like me, it doesn't jump out of your mind what number times that same number times that same number-- if you have three of those numbers and you were to multiply them together-- would be equal to 3,430. So what I'm going to do is to try to prime factorize this to find all the prime factors of 3,430 and see if any of those prime factors show up at least three times. And that'll help us with this. So 3,430-- it's clearly divisible by 5 and 2, or it's divisible by 10. So let's do that. So first we can divide it by 2. It's 2 times-- let's see. 3,430 divided by 2 is 1,715. Then we can divide it by 5, as well. We can factor 1,715 into 5 and-- let me do a little bit of long division on the side here. So if I have 1,715, and I'm going to divide it by 5. 5 doesn't go into 1. It goes into 17 three times. 3 times 5 is 15. Subtract, you get 2, and then you bring down a 1. 5 goes into 21 four times. 4 times 5 is 20. Subtract. Bring down the 5. 5 goes into 15 three times, so it goes exactly 343 times. So 1,715 can be factored into 5 times 343. Now, 343 might not jump out at you as a number that is easy to factor. It's clearly an odd number, so it won't be divisible by 2. Its digits add up to 10, which is not divisible by 3. So this isn't going to be divisible by 3. It's not going to be divisible by 4, because it's not divisible by 2. It's not going to be divisible by 5. If it wasn't divisible by 3 or 2, it's not going to be divisible by 6. And now we get to 7. Usually when you see a nutty number like this that doesn't seem to be divisible by a lot of things, it's always a good idea to try things like 7, 11, 13. Because those tend to construct very interesting numbers. So let's see if this is divisible by 7. So if I take 343 and if I want to divide it by 7, 7 goes into 30-- it doesn't go into 3-- 7 goes into 34 four times. 4 times 7 is 28. Subtract, 34 minus 28 is 6. Bring down a 3. 7 goes into 63 nine times. 9 times 7 is 63. Subtract. We don't have any remainder. And I forgot to do that last step up here. 3 times 15 is 15. Subtract, no remainder. It went in exactly. So here, 343 can be factored into 7 and 49. And 49 might jump out at you. It can be factored into 7 times 7. So this is interesting. I can rewrite all of this here-- the cube root of 3,430-- now as the cube root of-- I'm just going to write it in its factored form-- 2 times 5 times-- I could write 7 times 7 times 7, or I could write times 7 to the third power. That captures these three 7's right over here. I have three 7's, and then I'm multiplying them together. So that's 7 to the third power. And from our exponent properties, we know that this is the exact same thing as the cube root of 2 times 5 times the cube root-- so let me do that in that same, just so we see what colors we're dealing with. So the cube root of 2 times 5, which is the cube root of 10, times the cube root-- and I think you see where this is going-- of 7 to the third power. Keeping track of the colors is the hard part. And the cube root of 10, we just leave it as 10. We know the prime factorization of 10 is 2 times 5, so you're not going to just get a very simple integer answer here. You would get some decimal answer here, but here you get a very clear integer answer. The cube root of 7 to the third, well, that's just going to be 7. So this is just going to be 7. So our entire thing simplifies. This is equal to 7 times the cube root of 10. And this is about as simplified as we can get just using hand arithmetic. If you want to get the exact number here, you're probably best off using a calculator.",math_pre-algebra_pre-algebra-exponents-radicals
" I thought about using Velcro for doing this and actually tried sticking Velcro on the back of the batteries, but they tended to not stay very well. So as I put this in, I want to make sure that I loop it like this so that that top part is facing upward, and that'll mean that as I pull this through, it'll give it a nice, tight fit on the back side. All right. So you don't have to tighten it down all the way just yet, but you should get it pretty tight. It should be definitely not moving around. The batteries should be pretty firmly planted in their location. Yeah. That's pretty good there. All right. And we'll get the other one through. And again, we want to orient everything the same way just because if you put the zip tie the other way, it will not sit tightly against the battery. All right. It's fairly important when you mount the batteries that those are in the center, or pretty close to the center of the device, because it's where most of the weight is. So when you need to take these out, you can press it over to side and pull the batteries out. It's not super easy, but it'll hold them pretty well, and it's fairly, like I said, inexpensive. OK, so once you've got that pulled to a level of-- you want to make sure it's really tight, because that plastic will loosen over time. And just cut it off like that.",science_electrical-engineering_robots
" The perimeter of a rectangular fence measures 0.72 kilometers. The length of the fenced area is 160 meters. What is it's width? Now, the first thing that jumps out at me, and it might have jumped out at you, is that they're giving us different units. They're giving us the perimeter in terms of kilometers, and they're giving us the length in terms of meters. And I'm assuming that they want the width in terms of meters, since that's what they're giving us the length in. So what I want to do right from the get go is just convert the perimeter into meters. So we have the perimeter, and I'll just represent that with a p, is equal to 0.72 kilometers. Which I'll write km for short. Kilometers, 1,000 meters. That's what the prefix kilo- means. And so we can say that for every 1 kilometer we have 1,000 meters. Or we have 1,000 meters per every 1 kilometer. And you might say Sal, how do you know to multiply by 1,000, instead of divide by 1,000? And one way to think about it, and this is probably the best way to think about it, is just look, a kilometer is a bunch of meters. It's actually 1,000 meters. So if I'm converting kilometers into meters, I should have a much larger number. Whatever my number is in kilometers, it must be a much larger number of meters. So that's what tells you to multiply. And also, if you care about dimensional analysis, the dimensions cancel out here too. We have kilometers in the numerator, kilometers in the denominator. And so when you multiply it, you have 0.72 times 1,000 meters. And to multiply anything times 1,000, or really any power of 10, you say, look, if I multiply it by 10, I'll move the decimal to the right one space. That'd be multiplying it by 10, it would be 7.2. Multiplying it by 100 would give us 72. If we're multiplying by 1,000, that would give us 720. And I'll put a trailing 0 here, just so that we have something to move to the right of. So this is going to be equal to 720 meters. So that is the perimeter. Now let's remind ourselves what the perimeter even is. And then hopefully we can figure out the width. So let me draw a little box over here. And they tell us that the length is 160 meters. So let's say that's this dimension right over here. The length is 160 meters. So that would be this dimension and this, it's a rectangle. So these sides are both the same length. And our width is what we need to solve for. So that's our width, and this is also our width. And the perimeter is the measure going around it. So the perimeter is going to be this length, plus this width, plus that same length again, plus that width over there. Or another way to think about it-- and this might be a simpler way-- so there's a couple of ways you could think about it. You could say that the perimeter is equal to the length plus the width, plus the length plus the width. And then we know what the length is. So the perimeter would be equal to 160 meters plus the width. Actually, let me write the units down. 160 meters plus the width, plus 160 meters plus the width. And then we know what know the perimeter is, that's actually 720 meters. So 720 meters is the perimeter. So you would get 720 meters is equal to 160 meters, plus the width, plus 160 meters plus the width. Now there's a bunch of different ways to solve for the width. One way, you could just say, look, if I just have the width plus the length once, that's going to add up to half of the perimeter. So if I just go halfway around the rectangle, that's going to add up to half the perimeter. So if I take my width, which is w, plus my length, which is 160 meters, this should be equal to 1/2 of the perimeter. This should be equal to 1/2 times our perimeter, which is 720 meters. Or you get width plus 160 meters is equal to 1/2 times 720, or 720 divided by 2 is 360 meters. And so now you have a situation where we have the width plus 160 meters is 360 meters. So we could now subtract 360 from both sides. Or sorry, we could subtract 160 from both sides to solve for it. Or you could even do it in your head. If I say something plus 160 is 360, you could, in your head, say well, that something must be 200. 200 plus 160 is 360. So you could just say your width is 200 meters. Or if you want to do it a little bit more formally, you could say look, subtract 160 meters from both sides of this equation. And you are left with the width is equal to 200 meters. So that's one way to do it. We've solved the problem. The other way is, you could actually go straight from this equation. So we get 720. I'm just going to assume everything is in meters. 720. 160 meters plus 160 meters is 320. And that's going to be the same thing as the width plus the width. Or 2 times the width. Anything plus itself is just 2 times that anything. Now if this plus 320 is equal to 720, you could do in your head. You could say well, what plus 320 is 720? Well, this thing must be equal to 400. Or you could do it more formally, and subtract 320 from both sides of this. And you would get-- if you subtract 320 from here-- you would get 400 is equal to, subtract 320 from this side, you get 2 times the width. So if I have 2 times something is equal to 400, that something must be 200. Or if we want to do it more formally, you could divide both sides of this equation by 2. Either way, you will get the width is equal to 200 meters.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-perimeter-and-area-icse
" OK, so today we're going to show you how to make a projectile launcher. This launcher was originally designed by Dave Berggren's class in High Tech High in San Diego. He's an engineering teacher there and was a mentor of mine when I worked there. So there are a number of different parts on this. We're going to talk about each of them. It's made out of three pieces of wood. There's two 1-foot square pieces that are 3/4 of an inch thick. Those are 3/4-inch oak veneer plywood. We also have another piece here that's a 5-inch oak veneer plywood piece, also 3/4 inch thick. And so let's talk about this first. This piece has a bunch of different holes. They're set at 10-degree increments along this arc, and there's a 5/16 bolt that you can pull in and out and slide to change the angle of the launcher here. There's another piece right here. This is a piece of PVC. It's 2-inch PVC. It's screwed on to this extruded aluminum piece. This is 3/4-inch extruded aluminum, and it's connected with a 8/32 by 1 and 1/2 inch machine screw. And then if you look over here, we have a stop that's a 5/16 bolt. And that causes the bar to stop so that the ping-pong ball is released. And we have a pivot point. That's also a 5/16 bolt, and those are 2-inch long bolts. And the piece of aluminum here, this is extruded 3/4-inch square tubular aluminum, and it's 11 inches long. And then we have an eye screw here. That's a 5/32 eye screw that connects our spring. This spring is a 15/32 3-inch spring. And then we have another 5/16 bolt, a nut, and we've countersunk a hole so the nut sits below the surface. Let's take a look on the inside here. We've also created some holes, so we have a 5/8-inch center hole and a 1-inch hole. And the 1-inch hole goes down about 1/8 of an inch. The 5/8-inch hole goes down about 1/2 an inch, and that allows the nuts and washers on the backside of these bolts to sit inside the bottom piece and for the two pieces of wood to sit flush, which allows for 0 degree angle launches and things. We also have 2 and 1/2 inch hinges here in the back, and so that's pretty much the launcher there. Let's go ahead and get started. So this is our launcher, and it's the original design. We've got the angle adjustment mechanism here. You pull it back, and you can launch it. So that's basically how it works. You can pull the pin out, drop it down, and have it flat. So you're going to need a saw to cut the wood-- a circular saw will work great, like this one-- a drill to put some holes in it. You're going to also need a square. A try square like this works. You can also use a rafter square. And something to determine angles-- a compass. A file is important. You're also going to need a wrench and a pliers, hacksaw, and some spade bits and spiral drill bits. So we've got our 3/4-inch piece of oak veneer plywood here, and we've got all our parts laid out-- so our PVC and our different assorted washers and nuts. And you can see that we also have our different bolts and springs there, as well, and our piece of extruded aluminum. And so we're going to go ahead and start making our first hole, and that's going to be the hole for the 5/16 bolt that holds the spring in place-- that bolt right there. And so the way we do this is we have two nuts on either side of the bolt that we tighten down against each other to hold the bolt in place and keep it nice and stable. We're going to use a 7/8-inch spade bit. And we've got it taped about a 1/4 inch up, so we only go down 1/4 of an inch. And that'll allow us to countersink a hole. And then we're using our 5/16 spiral bit so we can put our bolt in the wood. And we're getting everything set up. This is our pattern we drew on the computer, and we're going to use that pattern to cut out different angles. We're going to use a small 3/32 bit to drill pilot holes, which makes it easier to drill our larger holes with the 5/16 bit, which is the size of the bolt that we'll actually have there. So the pilot holes help us to guide that larger bit into the correct location. OK, so now we're going to drill the center hole. And we're going to use a 7/8 drill bit. It's a spade bit. We've got it taped 1/4 of an inch up, and that will allow a recess for both our top nut and our washer to sit in. And then we'll use our 5/16 spiral bit to finish off the hole. Now we're going to drill our countersunk holes. These are the holes that go in the bottom piece and allow the washer and nut and bolt protruding from the top through the bottom of the top to sit inside of the bottom board. So we're just marking the center points for all of those different bolts, and we're going to use a 1-inch spade bit. And we'll go down about 1/8 of an inch with that 1/8 inch spade bit. We're taping that off about 1/8 of an inch, and then we're using a 5/8 inch spade bit to go down the rest of the way, which is about 1/2 an inch. And that'll leave enough space for the washer and the end of the bolt. So there's the 5/8 inch spade bit going the rest of the way. And make sure you do the smaller spade bit second. Now we're going to go ahead and set in our hinges. They're measured about an inch in from the edge. They're about 2 and 1/2-inch long hinges. So we've lined everything up with the aluminum, clamped it down, lining the hinges up, and then we're just marking the centers. And now we're going to take a 1/16-inch drill bit and tape it about 1/2 inch up. And so we've got the holes, and we're going to put our screws in, not going in all the way just yet, but most of the way. And then we're going to mark the other side and put the holes in for that. And now we're going to put our screws in on that side. And then we'll go through, and we'll tighten all of them down the rest of the way. All right. So now we're going to cut the angle portion, the part that has the arc of holes that allows us to set the different degrees of angle. So we are just using our aluminum as a fence. We're marking our part there. This is the last cut we have to make on it. It's 5 inches square. So we'll take our circular saw and trim that off. All right, now we've got our piece, so we're just going to file that off very quickly to clean up the edges. And now we're going to tape a pattern that we printed from the computer and use our 3/32-inch bit to create our pilot holes. So we'll put our pilot holes in that. And now we'll use our 5/16-inch bit to finish off the holes, make them the full size. All right, so that's the part that we just made. We're getting it lined up and centered. And we're going to mark it to line it up with our device, and we're marking it so that we can put our screws in about 3/8 of an inch up from the very bottom of the device. That means that the screws will be in the center of the bottom board we're screwing into. And we're using 1/16-inch drill bit, and we're spacing those holes about 1 inch and 1/4 apart. I'm going to use some 1 inch and 1/2 long panhead wood screws to hold the angle piece in place. So we're just drilling those holes and putting those wood screws in right now, tightening it all down. And we'll check to make sure that it all fits right and moves, and it does. OK. So now we're going to cut our launcher bar. And we're just using a hacksaw. That's measured at 11 inches, so it sits inside the edge from either side about 1/2 an inch. And we're cleaning it up with a file there. And now we're going to mark our center and drill our center. We're, again, going to use the 3/32-inch bit to create that pilot hole. And then we'll take the bar down, and we're going to line it up with the pieces that we want to bolt onto the bar. And so we've got our PVC there and our eye screw for the spring. So we're going to drill the holes for those two components. All right, so we're drilling our pilot holes in the aluminum bar that's going to launch the ping-pong ball, and that's a 3/32 bit there. Now that we have our pilot holes, we can put the larger holes in place for our eye screw and for the machine screw that's going to hold the PVC cradle in place. Now we're making our PVC cradle. And we're just going to cut it in half, using a clamp and a hacksaw. And in order to get it just right, we need to reposition it there. Now, the hacksaw leaves a rough edge, so we'll clean edge up with a break-off blade knife. You want to be careful doing that, so you don't cut yourself. And then we'll use a file to just smooth off the edges the rest of the way. Then we'll mark the center about 3/8 of an inch up and drill a pilot hole and then our final hole. Now we're going to assemble all the different components. We're inserting washers and then nuts on the top, lock washers and nuts on the bottom for the bolt holding the spring in. And now we're going to put our eye screw in, and then we're going to insert the center pivot screw. And that's got two nylon washers and then two washers and two nuts and a lock washer on it. So we can tighten that down. That holds the bolt in place but still allows the aluminum to spin freely, you can see there. Now we're going to put our stop in place, and that's just another 5/16 bolt with some nylon washers around it. And we've got a PVC cradle that we've trimmed out there for our machine screw, because it's got a flanged head. And we're tightening that down now. So we'll use our wrench to hold that in place and a screwdriver 1to tighten that up. 1So we've got our cradle ready to go. 1So now we're going to take the spring 1and try and attach it using our needle-nose pliers to the eye 1screw, and then we're going to take our launcher 1and take it outside and do some tests. 1We did a number of tests with it, 1and we found that some of the time, the ball 1would curve to the left. 1And so we're going to make some design modifications 1in our next video.",science_physics_discoveries
" We covered the idea of vector length many, many videos ago. And I realize that I forgot to cover an important topic. This topic's going to be useful when we do some types of transformation -- actually, the projections that I'll do in the next video. The notion that I forgot to do is the notion of a unit vector. And all this is, is a vector that has a length of 1. Has length and we've defined length. It has a length of 1. So if something is a unit vector, let's say that u here is a unit vector, and it's a member of Rn. Then that means that if we have u, u looks like this, has n components, u2 all the way to un. We know what the length of this is, right? We know that the length of u, sometimes called the norm of u, it's just equal to the square root of the squared sums of all of its components. And if you think about it, this is just an extension of the Pythagorean theorem, to some degree. So it's u1 squared plus u2 squared all the way to un squared. And it's the square root of that. If this is a unit vector, if this is a unit vector, so this is a unit vector, that implies that the length of u will be equal to 1. And that doesn't matter in what dimension space we are. This could be R100 this could be R2. For it to have a unit vector in any of those spaces, their length is 1. The next obvious question is, how do you construct a unit vector? Let's say that I have some vector, v. And let's say it's not a unit vector. It's v1 v2 all the way to vn. And I want to turn it into some vector u that is a unit vector, that just goes in the same direction. So u will go in the same direction, as v, but the length of u is going to be equal to 1. How do I construct this vector u here? What I could do is, I could take the length of v. I could find out what the length of v is, and we know how to do that. We just apply this definition of vector length. And what happens if I figure out the length of v, and then I multiply the vector v times that? What if I make my u, what if I say u is equal to, 1 over the length of v times v itself? What happens here? If I take the length of this thing right here, what do I get? The length of u is equal to the length of this scalar. Remember this is just some number, right? It's equal to this scalar, and I'm assuming v is a non-zero vector. The length of whatever this scalar number is times v. And we know that we can take this scalar out of the formula, we can show that -- I think I've shown it in a previous video -- that the length of c times v is equal to c times the length of v. Let me write that down. And that's essentially what I'm assuming right here. That if I take the length of c times some vector, v, that is equal to c times the length of v. I think we showed this when we first were introduced to the idea of length. So we know that this is going to be equal to 1 over the length of vector v -- that's my c -- times, so this thing right here is that thing right there, times this thing, times the length of vector v. Well what's this going to be equal to? 1 over something times that something. Well this is just going to be equal to 1. So that's all a unit vector is. If you want to find a unit vector -- or sometimes it's called a normalized vector -- that goes in the same direction as some vector v, you just figure out the length of v using the definition of vector length in Rn. And then multiply 1 over that length times the vector v -- and this is just a scalar -- and then you get your vector u. Let me to do an example, just to make sure you get the idea. Let's say I have some vector v and it's in R3. Let's say it's 1, 2, minus 1. What is the length of v? The length of v is equal to the square root of 1 squared plus 2 squared plus minus 1 squared, and that is equal to the square root of 1 plus 1 plus 4 -- square root of 6. So that is the length of v. If I want to construct a normalized vector u that goes in the same direction as v, I can just define my vector u as being equal to 1 over the length of v -- 1 over the square root of 6 -- times v. So times 1, 2, minus 1. Which is equal to 1 over square root of 6, 2 over square root of 6, and minus 1 over the square root of 6. And I'll leave it for you to verify that the length of u is going to be equal to 1. I'll just throw out one other idea here that you'll often see. When something is a unit vector, instead of using this little arrow on top of the vector, they'll often write a unit vector with a little hat on top of it, like that. That signifies that we're dealing with a unit vector. And for those of you've taken your vector calculus, or have done a little bit of engineering, you're probably familiar with the vectors i, j, and k. And the reason why they have this little hat here is because these are all unit vectors in R3. They're members of R3 and they're all unit vectors. These are actually the basis vectors in R3. And for those of you who have been watching my transformation videos, these are equivalent to the vectors e1 -- which I could write with a hat on it, really -- e2, and e3. Which are the standard basis vectors in R3. Now that you've been exposed to it, now I can start to use the idea of a unit vector in future videos.",math_linear-algebra_matrix-transformations
"  So continuing the history of the ideal gas equation here. We get to the 19th century with an Italian chemist name Amedeo Avogadro. Actually his name was Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro di Quaregna e di Cerreto, but we're going to call him Amedeo. Amedeo spent a bit of his time experimenting with tiny particles. In honor of his experiments, the number of particles in one mole of something was named Avogadro's Number which is approximately 6.02 times 10 to the 23. One thing that Avogadro postulated was that equal volumes of gas at the same temperature and pressure contain equal number of particles whether those particles are atoms or molecules. For instance, if you filled up four balloons to exactly one liter at 25 degrees Celsius with different gases, so let's have a green balloon, and we can say that this green balloon is argon, and we'll have a pink balloon, and I'll try to make it the exact same size as the previous one, and we'll say it's nitrogen. Then we've got a blue balloon that we'll say is hydrogen. Again, I'm off a little bit in the sizes, but we're saying that all of these have exactly one liter volume. Then our fourth balloon will be yellow, and we'll say it's filled with methane. What Avogadro was saying was that at one liter each one of these four balloons would have the same number of particles. I'm using five particles, but the point is that all of these balloons would have the same number of particles. At one liter, each of these balloons would contain .041 moles. If we use Avogadro's Number here, that's the same thing as saying that each of these balloons would be filled with 2.5 times 10 to the 22 particles. If you think about it, this is the exact same thought behind our value for the molar volume at STP. We said that for any gas, one mole at STP would take up a volume of about 22.4 liters. The fact that we know this is true for any gas not just kind of a particular gas, is credited to the work of Amedeo Avogadro. Avogadro used this idea and some intuition to develop his law which is V is equal to A, a constant A, times the number of moles which means that the moles of gas, the number of particles of gas in the system varies directly with the volume. Or the quotient of V and N is equal to a constant. I'm sure that you've used this same intuition when you've blown up a balloon. As you put in more air particles, as you blow more air into the balloon, the balloon gets larger. For example, if we put in one mole of air particles, the balloon would be about 22.4 liters. As we blew more air into it, say another third of a mole, we would increase the volume to 29.88 liters. Another third of a mole of air gets us up to 29.88 liters. Our volume is getting bigger. If we were to blow even more air into this system, we would increase the volume even more. So another third of a mole of air would bring our volume up to 37.35 liters. Our volume has expanded proportionally to the amount of air that we've increased in this system. Avogadro's law validates the V,N part of the ideal gas equation because the volume and the moles are directly proportional to each other. Let's put this principle to work in an example. When .15 moles of helium gas are added to a piston containing .82 miles of another gas, by what percent does the total volume increase assuming isothermal and isobaric conditions? Isothermal is same temperature, and isobaric is same pressure. We have same temperature, same pressure, and we're looking for the percent of volume increase related to the molar increase. This is a perfect opportunity to use Avogadro's Law. Let's start with V1 divided by N1 is equal to V2 divided by N2. We know this is true because Avogadro's Law says that the quotient of the volume and the number of moles is constant for an ideal gas. So the initial conditions would equal the final conditions. We have a ratio set up here, and we can rearrange this ratio to say that V1 over V2 is equal to N1 over N2. Here we've got kind of an interesting part that we can actually start using to solve this problem because what we see is that the increase in volume is directly proportional to the increase in moles. For that reason, the percent change in volume looks like the final volume minus the initial volume divided by the initial volume. This is just the formula kind of for percent change which is pretty intuitive. The final volume minus the initial volume, the change, divided by the initial volume is going to give us the percent change. We know that this is equal to the percent change in the number of moles so we can say N2 minus N1 divided by N1. This really gets us to a point where we can use the values in the formula because it gives us an initial number of particles, an initial moles and it gives us the change in moles. We had the final moles as well. To find the final moles because it just says that .15 moles are added to .82. We'll need to add those together so .82 plus .15 is equal to .97. So .97 is our final number of moles. That would be our N2. Let's substitute these values in. Our final moles is .97 minus our initial moles which is .82 divided by our initial moles. That's going to give us .15 divided by .82. Now we're at a point where we can solve this, and we can just kind of evaluate this expression and that would give us the total, or the percent of the total volume increase, but I want to take a second and I want to think about how we could think about this kind of with some common sense and use rounding to give us an approximate answer. So .15 divided by .82 is between .15 divided by 1, and .15 divided by .75. And .15 divided by 1 is 15%, and .15 divided by .75 it goes into .75 five times so that would give us 20% because one-fifth is 20%. If we had to think about this expression in a hurry, say on a test, and we didn't have a calculator, we could use rounding to give us a pretty approximate answer. We know that the answer is between 15 and 20%. It turns out that that actual answer if you do use a calculator is really close to 18.3%. So when .15 moles of helium gas are added to a piston containing .82 moles of another gas, by what percent does the total volume increase? It's just about exactly 18.3%. We were able to solve this problem with a little bit of critical thinking based on the principles of Avogadro's Law.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-phy-kinetic-theory
" - Hi, I'm Hank, and I'm a human. But let's pretend for a moment that I'm a moth. And not just any moth. A peppered moth. Now let's pretend that I'm living in London in the early 1800s right as the Industrial Revolution is starting. Life is swell. My light-colored body lets me blend in with the light-colored likens in tree bark, which means that birds have a hard time seeing me and which means that I get to live. But it's starting to get noticeably darker around here with all these coal-powered factories spewing soot into the air, and suddenly all the trees have gone from looking like this to looking like this. So thanks to the soot-covered everything, I've got problems. But you know who doesn't have problems? My brother. He looks like this. Yeah, he has a different form of the gene that affects pigmentation. Moths like him represent about 2% of all the peppered moths at the start of the Industrial Revolution, but by 1895, it'll be 95%. Why? Well, you're probably already guessing, as the environment gets dirtier, darker moths will be eaten less often and therefore will have more opportunities to make baby moths, while the white ones will get eaten more so overtime the black color trait will become more common. As for me. (upbeat music) My friends, it's a wonderful example of natural selection, the process by which certain inherited traits make it easier for some individuals to thrive and multiply, changing the genetic makeup of populations over time. For this revelation, which remains one of the most important revelations in biology, we have to thank Charles Darwin, who first identified this process in his revolutionary 1859 book, On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection. Now, lots of factors play a role in how species change over time, including mutation, migration, random changes in how frequently some allele show up, a process known as genetic drift. But natural selection is the most powerful and most important cause of evolutionary change, which is why today we're going to talk about the principles behind it and the different ways in which it works. Darwin came to understand the process of natural selection because he spent his adult life, even most of his childhood, obsessed with observing nature. He studied barnacles, earth worms, birds, rocks, tortoises, fossils, fish, insects, and to some extent even his own family. And I'll get back to that in a bit. But it was during Darwin's famous voyage on the HMS Beagle in the 1830s surveying expedition around the world that he began to formulate this theory. Darwin was able to study all kinds of organisms and he kept amazing journals. Looking back on his notes he hit upon a couple of particularly important factors in species survival. One of them was the many examples of adaptions he noticed on his journey. The ways in which organisms seem to be ideally shaped to enhance their survival and reproduction in specific environments. Maybe the most famous example of these were the variations of beaks Darwin observed among the finches in the remote Galapagos Islands off the coast of South America. He observed more than a dozen closely related finch species all of which were quite similar to mainland finch species, but each island species had different shape and size beaks that were adapted to the food available specifically on each island. If there were hard seeds, the beaks were thick. If there were insects, the beaks were skinny and pointed. If there were cactus fruit, the beaks were sharp to puncture the fruit's skin. These superior inherited traits led to Darwin to another idea. The finches' increased fitness for their environment, that is their relative ability to survive and create offspring. Explaining the effects of adaptation and relative fitness would become central to Darwin's idea of natural selection. And today, we often define natural selection and describe how it drives evolutionary change by four basic principles based on Darwin's observations. So, first principle is that different members of a population have all kinds of individual variations. These characteristics, whether they're body size, hair color, blood type, facial markings, metabolisms, reflexes, they're called phenotypes. The second is that many of these variations are heritable and can be passed on to offspring. If a trait happens to be favorable, it does future generations no good if it can't be passed on. Third, and this one tends to get glossed over a lot even though it's probably the most interesting, is Darwin's observation that populations can often have way more offspring than resources like food and water can support. This leads to what Darwin called the struggle for existence. He was inspired here by the work of Thomas Malthus, an economist who wrote that when human populations get too big, we get things like plague and famine and wars and then only some of us survive and continue to reproduce. If you missed the SciShow Infusion that we did on human overpopulation today and Malthus's predictions, you should check it out now. This finally leads to the last principle of natural selection which is that given all of this competition for resources, heritable traits that affect individuals fitness can lead to variations in their survival and reproductive rates. It's just another way of saying that those of favorable traits are more likely to come out on top and will be more successful with their baby making. So, in order to wrap all these principles together, in order for natural selection to take place, a population has to have variations, some of which are heritable. And when a variation makes an organism more competitive, that variation will tend to be selected. Like with the peppered moth, it survived because there was a variation within the species, the dark coloration, which was heritable and in turn allowed every moth that inherited that trait to better survive the hungry birds of London. But notice how this works. A single variation in a single organism is only the very beginning of the process. The key is that individuals don't devolve. Instead, natural selection produces evolutionary change because it changes the genetic composition of entire populations. And that occurs through interactions between individuals and their environment. (happy piano music) Let's get back to Darwin for a minute. In 1870, Darwin wrote to his neighbor and parliamentarian, John Lubbock, requesting that a question be added to England's census regarding the frequency of cousins marrying and the health of their offspring. His request was denied but the question was something that weighted heavily on Darwin's mind 'cause he was married to Emma Wedgwood, who happened to be his first cousin. Her grandfather was Josiah Wedgwood, founder of the company that remains famous for its pottery and china, and he was also Darwin's grandfather. In fact, much of Darwin's family tree was complicated. His marriage to Emma was far from the first Wedgwood-Darwin pairing. Darwin's maternal grandparents and mother were also Wedgwoods and there were several other marriages between cousins in the family, though not always between those two families. So, Darwin and to a greater extent his children carried more genetic material of Wedgwood origin than Darwinian. And this cost some problems, the likes of which Darwin was all too aware thanks to his own scientific research. Darwin of course spent time studying the effects of crossbreeding and inbreeding in plants and animals, noting that consanguineous pairs often resulted in weaker and sickly descendance, and the same was true of his family. Emma and Charles had 10 children, three of whom died in childhood from infectious disease, which is more likely to be contracted by those with high levels of inbreeding, and while none of Darwin's seven other children had any deformities, he noted that they were not very robust and that three of them were unable to have children of their own. Likely, another effect of inbreeding. Now, so far, we've been talking about natural selection in terms of physical characteristics like beak shape or coloration, but it's important to understand that it's not just an organism's physical form, or its phenotype, that's changing, but its essential genetic form, or its genotype. The heritable variations we've been talking about are a function of the alleles that organisms are carrying around. And as organisms become more successful, evolutionarily speaking, by surviving in larger numbers for longer and having more kids, that means that the alleles that mark their variation become more frequent. But these changes can come about in different ways, and to understand how, let's walk through the different modes of selection. The mode we've been talking about for much of this episode is an example of directional selection, which is when a favored trait is at one extreme end of the range of traits, like from short to tall or white to black or blind to having super night goggle vision. Over time, this leads to distinct changes in the frequency of that expressed trait in a population, when a single phenotype is favored. So, our peppered moth is an example of a population whose trait distribution is shifting toward one extreme, almost all whitish moths, to the other extreme, almost all blackish. Another awesome example is giraffes' necks. They've gotten really long over time because there was selection pressure against short necks which couldn't reach all of those delicious leaves. But there's also stabilizing selection which selects against extreme phenotypes and instead favors the majority that are well adapted to an environment. An example that's often used is a human's birth weight. Very small babies have a harder time defending themselves from infections and staying warm, but very large babies are too large to deliver naturally. Because of this, the survival rate for babies has historically been higher for those in middle-weight range, which helps stabilize the average birth weight. At least until cesarean sections became as common as bad tattoos. So, what happens when the environment favors extreme traits at both ends of the spectrum whilst selecting against common traits? That's disruptive selection. Now, examples of this are rare but scientists think that they found an instance of it in 2008 in a lake full of tiny crustaceans called Daphnia. The population was hit with an epidemic of a yeast parasite and after about a half a dozen generations, a variance had emergence in how the Daphnia responded to the parasite. Some became less susceptible to the yeast but were smaller and had fewer organism, the others actually became more susceptible but were bigger and able to reproduce more, 1at least while they were still alive. 1So there were two traits that were being selected for, 1both in extremes and both to the exclusion of each other. 1Susceptibility and fecundity. 1If you got one, you didn't get the other. 1Also an interesting example 1of selection being driven by a parasite. 1Now, while these are the main ways 1that selective pressures can affect populations, 1those pressures can also come from factors 1other than environmental ones 1like food supply or predators or parasites. 1There's also sexual selection, 1another concept introduced by Darwin 1and described in the Origin of Species 1as depending not on a struggle for existence 1but a struggle between individuals of the same sex, 1generally the males, 1for the possession of the other sex. 1Basically, for individuals to maximize their fitness, 1they not only need to survive 1but they also need to reproduce more, 1and they can do that one of two ways. 1One, they can make themselves attractive 1to the opposite sex. 1Or two, they can go for the upper hand 1by intimidating, deterring, 1or defeating the same sex rivals. 1The first of these strategies is how we ended up with this. 1I mean, the peacock tail isn't exactly camouflage. 1But the more impressive the tail, 1the better the chances a male will find a mate 1and will pass its genes to the next generation. 1Sad looking peacock tails will diminish over generations, 1making it a good example of directional sexual selection. 1The other strategy involves fighting, 1or at least looking like you want to fight 1for the privilege of mating, 1which tends to select for bigger or stronger 1or meaner-looking mates. 1And, finally, thanks to us humans, 1there are also unnatural forms of selection, 1and we call that artificial selection. 1People have been artificially selecting plants and animals 1for thousands of years 1and Darwin spent a lot of time in the Origin of Species 1talking about breeding of pigeons 1and of cattle and of plants 1to demonstrate the principles of selection. 1We encourage the selection of some traits 1and discourage others, 1that's how we got grains that produce all those nutrients. 1Which is how we managed to turn the gray wolf 1into domesticated dogs that can look like this 1or like that. 1Two of my favorite examples of artificial selection. 1Now, these are different breeds of dogs. 1Oh, where are you going? 1No, no. 1But they're still both dogs, they're the same species. 1Technically, a corgi and a greyhound could get together 1and have a baby dog, 1though it would be a weird-looking dog. 1But what happens 1when selection makes populations so different 1that they can't even be the same species anymore? 1Well, that's what we're gonna talk about next episode 1on Crash Course Biology. 1How one species can turn into another species.",science_biology_crash-course-bio-ecology
"  Next time you're with a group of friends, and you have to go pee, be a little fancy. Stand up and announce to them that I must now undergo micturition. Micturition, which is a fancy phrase for ""to pee,"" or ""to urinate."" And so in this video we're gonna talk about the process of micturition. Beginning where we left off in the kidney, after we concentrate urine in our nephrons, we have this part that sort of touches the tip of the renal medulla, that's our renal calyx. Our renal calyx will be the part to first collect urine from the collecting tubules, and we said several renal calyces coalesce together into the renal pelvis, so that's the renal pelvis right there, and then the renal pelvis itself leaves the kidney through this tube called the ureter, and we've got two ureters right there. The ureter then conducts our urine inferiorly, or towards our feet, by connecting into the bladder. And note that these dotted lines imply that the ureter's attached to the back, or the posterior aspect of the bladder. So our ureters are like a one-way street, because they have valves that prevent backflow of urine upwards. That means that the urine will only flow down towards your feet, but there are certainly some exceptions to this, which I encourage you then to think about what can happen. What could happen if you allow urine to sort of flow backwards instead of in one direction towards the loo, or the toilet, and we'll talk about that in a minute, but for now, from our ureter our urine makes it into the bladder that I've drawn right here, and you can see it from the front like this, but it may be useful to take a look at it from the side. So if I say this is the top, and then the bottom is over here, and our anterior side, or the front on this side, and our posterior aspect, or the back on this side, our bladder would look like this. We'd have this top right here, and then kind of spin down, like so, and this front part right here would be kind of pointy, and so this comes down and collects here. And don't forget that our ureters conduct urine to the back right there, so we can draw two of them, these guys right there, and this is our posterior aspect, and the fancy thing about our bladder is that it's lined with something that's called transitional epithelium, which is something like what you've heard of before. You may have heard of squamous epithelium, which is just flat epithelial cells, or columnar epithelium, which are taller cells. Transitional just means they're somewhere in between. And the reason why we do this, is because it allows the bladder to expand. Remember, the bladder is going to be filling up with urine, and holding onto it, until we're at an appropriate place to go to the bathroom. So until then, our transitional epithelium allows our bladder to fill up and hold about 300 to 500 milliliters of urine, which is about the volume of a tall bottle of water. This then leads to a structure down here, and I'll draw going that-a-way, and I'll draw it here as well. That goes straight into the loo. This final part of our urinary tract is called the urethra. And we don't just have urine leak from the bladder and go straight into the urethra. There's some control here at the neck of the bladder. Right about there, we have what's called the internal, because it's deep inside us, the internal urethral, because it surrounds the urethra, sphincter. That's the internal urethral sphincter, and it's just a circle of muscle, that is not under our control, but it makes sure that the bladder keeps urine within it, and doesn't leak out urine, unless it's really full. And so we don't have control over the internal urethral sphincter. So if you were to guess what type of muscle this is, I'm sure you'd say, this certainly is going to be smooth muscle, because it's involuntarily controlled. And just for reference, that sits about right there. So that's going to be our internal urethral sphincter. So now that we've covered the bladder, I think this would be a good opportunity to take a look at a video, within this video, that shows how the ureters spray urine into the bladder. We call this a ureter jet, and sometimes you can see this on ultrasound, like here. I've oriented the ultrasound like this, so you can kind of take a look at the top, and the bottom of the bladder, but some of the rest of this image may be a little different, but just focus on the bladder for right now, and let's play this video. Oh, and I should mention that this thing right here tells you how much flow that you have, so notice whenever you see anything in yellow or orange, that just means that's urine that's being ejected into the bladder. So as I press play, notice that we have one stream that fires in, that's one ureter. And then when that stops, we're very lucky to see another ureter right there fire some urine into our bladder. I got this video from one of my mentors. Dr. John Fox was very nice to lend me this. Going back to the cartoon world that we have here, we can focus on what happens once urine leaves the bladder and goes into the urethra. The urethra will conduct urine to the outside world, and that's the organ that we use to pee away our urine, but the path from the bladder to the bathroom is very different if we're talking about men versus women. So I've got this female bladder right here, that's going to lead into a female urethra, that we're going to talk about, and I'm gonna contrast that with the male urethra. Now to be complete, the female urethra has sort of the same set-up as the male urethra. It leads out of the body, and has its own internal urethral sphincter right up there. And then there's a part of the urethra that happens afterwards right here that's called the membranous urethra, so membranous because we pass though a membrane, or a sheet that circles the urethra, and so we already talked about something that circles the urethra already, and that's kind of right above the structure I'm drawing in right now. We had the internal urethral sphincter that was circling our urethra at the neck of the bladder. Down here, this membrane, or this sheet that we have sort of circling our urethra is the external urethral sphincter. And because it's external, and it's something that WE control, this is going to be made up of skeletal muscle. And this is what we learn to control through potty training. Now to contrast that with the male situation, we don't go directly into the membranous urethra. No, instead we have a portion that's called the prostatic urethra, because we pass through an organ called the prostate. It's not directly involved in the urinary system, but it circumscribes the urethra right there. After the prostatic urethra, then we have the membranous urethra. So that's the part that's the same as what we've got in women. So we have our membranous urethra, and of course, in dudes, we've also got this sheet, or this muscle that's surrounding our urethra here, that's our external urethral sphincter that's under voluntary control because it's skeletal muscle, and then from there, we lead into what's called the spongy urethra. The spongy urethra is just the part of the urethra that's in the penis. So that's in the penis, and then afterwards, the urine leaves the body, and it's out in the external world. This entire system right here is in contact with the external environment. Now as you may have guessed, women don't have a spongy urethra. So what happens after the membranous urethra is actually kind of short-lived. This is actually going to be pretty short in comparison to the male urethra, so the connection to the outside world is a little more direct in females than it is in men. Now this kind of goes back to that comment I made earlier about backflow. We make sure that our valves here in the ureter makes urine go in one direction, to the bladder, and then we're gonna go out this way. But if we don't have valves, and we do have backflow, we can end up having what's called stasis, or urine just kind of hanging out up here, or maybe up in the kidney for a long period of time. Now that can be problematic, especially because we're in contact with the external environment, and you know that there are things like bacteria, and viruses, and fungi that can cause an infection. So if we have stasis right here, I'll just write a little telephone pole right there, stasis right there, we may have a greater risk of infection, because one of the functions of urinating is also to dispel bacteria that may have made it up the urethra from contact with the external environment. So we have a greater risk of infection if we have backflow, and we have a greater risk of infection if we have a shorter urethra, which is what happens in females. And that's the whole reason why women tend to have more urinary tract infections, so I'll write that down, that's a urinary tract infection, a UTI. They happen more so in women than they do in men because women have a shorter urethra. Either way, the urine makes it out of the body, goes into the loo, and effectively discards the waste products that we've made in our body, that we've filtered and concentrated in our kidneys.",science_high-school-biology_hs-human-body-systems
" -  So in the last video I described how to interpret three dimensional graphs and I have another three dimensional graph here, it's a very bumpy guy. And this happens to be the graph with the function f of x, y is equal to cosine of x multiplied by the sine of y and you know I could also say like, that this graph represents I could also say that this graph represents z is equal to that whole value because we think about the output of the function as the z coordinate of each point and what I want to do here is describe how you can interpret the relationship between this graph and these functions that you know by taking slices of it. So for example let's say that we took a slice with this plane here and what this plane here is is it represents the value x equals zero and you can kinda see that because this is the x-axis. So when you're at zero on the x-axis you know, you pass through the origin and then the values of y and z can go freely so you end up with this plane. And let's say you want to just consider where this cuts through the graph, okay, so we'll limit our graph just down to the point where it cuts it and I'm going to draw a little red line over that spot. Now what you might notice here that red line looks like a sinusoidal wave in fact it looks exactly like the sine function itself you know, passes through the origin it starts by going up and this makes sense if we start to plug things into the original form here. Because if you take f and you plug in x equals zero but then we still let y range freely what it means is that you're looking at cosine of zero multiplied by sine of y And what is cosine of zero? cosine of zero evaluates to one so this whole function should look just like sine of y in that when we let y run freely the output, which is still represented by the z coordinate, will give us this graph that's just a normal two-dimensional graph that we're probably familiar with. And let's try this at a different point. Let's see what would happen if instead of plugging in x equals zero let's imagine that we plugged in y equals zero and this time before I graph it and before I show everything that goes on let's just try to figure out purely from the formula here what it's going to look like when we plug in y equals zero. So now I'm going to write over on the other side. We have f of x will still run freely y is going to be fixed as zero and what this means is we have cosine of x so maybe expect to see something that looks kinda like a cosine graph and then sine of zero. Except, what is sine of zero? Sine of zero cancels out and just becomes zero which multiplied by cosine of x means everything cancels out and becomes zero so what you'd expect is that this is going to look like a constant function that's constantly equal to zero. And let's see if that's what we get. So I'm going to slice it with y equals zero here and you look at the y axis we see when it's zero and x and z both run freely. I'm going to chop off my graph at that point, and indeed it chops it just at this straight line, the straight line that goes right along the x-axis. But let's say that we did a different constant value of y. Rather than y equals zero, and we'll erase all of this, let's say that I cut things at some other value. So in this case what I've chosen is y is equal to pi halves and it looks kinda like we've got a wave here and it looks like a cosine wave and you can probably see where this is going. This is when x is running freely and if we start to imagine plugging this in I'll just actually write it out. We've got cosine of x and then y is held at a constant sine of pi halves. Sine of pi halves is just, this just always equals one so we could replace this with one which means the function as a whole should look like cosine x. So again the multi-variable function we've frozen y and we're letting x range freely and it ends up looking like a cosine function and I think a really good way to understand a given three-dimensional graph when you see it, let's say you, you look back at the original graph when we don't have anything going on. Get rid of that little line. So you've got this graph and it looks wavy and bumpy and a little bit hard to understand at first but if you just think in terms of holding one variable constant it boils down always into a normal two-dimensional graph and you can even think about, as you're lighting planes, kinda slide back and forth what that means for the amplitude of the wave that you see and things like that. This become especially important, by the way, when we introduce a notion of partial derivatives.",math_multivariable-calculus_thinking-about-multivariable-function
" So you're pretty familiar with this image of the heart. We have the four chambers. And I'm just going to start by labeling them-- the right atrium and right ventricle on this side and the left atrium and left ventricle on this side. And the question is this. What happens if we choose two spots? I'm going to choose this one right here, with the little x in left ventricle and some other spot over here in the aorta, let's say, with the purple x. And this is, of course, our aorta up here. What happens if I follow the pressure at those two spots? So of course, I was going to say maybe if I'm the red blood cell sitting there, but we know red blood cells move around. But let's say I'm just following the pressure at those two spots, those locations, over time. So this will be time over here. What does the pressure look like at that location? And let's say I'm following for, let's say, one second. So, if my heart rate was somewhere like 60 beats a minute, that would basically mean one second would be one beat. This is 60 beats a minute. And just keep in mind, 60 beats a minute is actually pretty low. So that would be like if I'm reading a book or sitting around relaxing. And on this side, let's do pressure. And I'll do 0 to, let's say, 100 up here. And remember, the units of pressure are millimeters of mercury. Now actually, before I start, let me even jump into some naming, just so we don't have to stop later. These are the valves. This is the mitral valve. And below it, I've drawn the tricuspid valve. And put together, we would call these the AtrioVentricular valves. This is the AtrioVentricular valves. And AtrioVentricular, I've capitalized A and V because sometimes you'll see the word AV valves. AtrioVentricular valves are also known as AV valves. And the other two valves, here, this is the pulmonary valve down here. And on the other side of it right here is the aortic valve. Put together, we would call these the semilunar valves. And actually, semilunar, you might think of it as like a half moon. But there's no shorthand for that, usually. So people just call them the semilunar valves. So what does the pressure tracing look like at my yellow x? Let's go back to that question. So I'll start out here on the axis. So it starts out really low. Left ventricular pressure is surprisingly low most of the time. And you'll actually see that now when I draw it out. You know, I always think of it as this chamber that's cranking and pushing and high pressure. And that's true. There is some of the points along the way when the pressure gets very high. But for most of the time, it's actually pretty low. And it creeps along, goes up very slowly. Well, why is it going up at all? That's the first question. Why doesn't it just stay steady? Whatever pressure it is, why is it going up? Well, it's going up because there's actually flow here through the mitral valve. So blood is going into the left ventricle initially, and when there's more blood in that chamber, over time, the pressure slowly builds up. Just like if I'm pouring water into a water balloon, over time, every little bit more water I put in there, the pressure in the balloon goes up. So, that's why it's creeping up. And then you get to a point where all of the sudden, there's a muscle contraction. So you have a depolarization wave that comes through, and all of this heart muscle is cranking, just pushing in. And of course, simultaneously, the right ventricle is doing the exact same thing. So all of the things that I'm saying for the left ventricle, for the most part apply also on the other side. So they're contracting. And the left ventricle contracts hard, and the pressure begins to rise. Now just right there, just right where it begins to rise, you might say, well, what did you even do? And at that moment where I drew a slight increase, a tiny little increase-- you can see it if you squint your eyes-- at that moment, this valve closes. Why? Because at that moment, at that very moment, there is a little bit of push back here. And the slightest bit of push back makes the valve shut. So once the pressure on the left ventricle side is greater than the pressure on the left atrium side, the valve shuts. And so the valve closes at that point. And then you have a rise, a rapid rise, in the left ventricular pressure. And it goes up, up, up, like that. So let me just write that down since I just said it. The AV valves close. And that's a new thing, because they were open. So let me box that. AV valves close. And the semilunar valves, the other ones, they stay open. Semilunar stays open-- nothing new there. Actually, sorry, I said open, and I'm even writing open. But I mean close. Sorry. So let me not confuse you and just change that right now. Semilunar valves stay shut. And to drive home that message, I'll even put a block there. So they're still shut. So all the valves at this point are now closed. And that might be news to you. You might have thought, well, I thought at some point, some valves were always open. And that's not true. At this point, both valves are closed. And the left ventricle is basically squeezing. But the blood has really nowhere to go. It's just sitting in a trapped room, and the pressure is rising and rising fast. And then at some point, it gets to a spot where an interesting thing occurs. So let me actually draw that here. Let me erase this slightly. Let's draw the aortic pressure. So the aortic pressure, let's say, is something like this. And it's drifting down. Well, why is aortic pressure drifting down? Well, it's because in the aorta, blood is rushing away. Remember, from the previous squeeze, you've got blood rushing away, out all these vessels. It's going away. And as blood rushes away, of course, pressure is going to fall. Remember, there is a relationship between having more blood volume and pressure. So as the blood volume in the aorta drifts away, the pressure drifts down. And this aortic pressure is rising. And at that spot-- it's hard to see, again. I'm going to just circle it to draw your attention to it. But at that spot, you'll see the aortic pressure is slightly below left ventricular pressure. And because the pressure is slightly below, all of the sudden, this is no longer blocked. Now you've got a free path here. This valve opens up, and blood can come in. So new blood can come in from the left ventricle. So blood starts rushing in. And of course, the left ventricle is still contracting, so it still continues to rise. And it gets to about there. And the aortic pressure is going to rise. And so let me draw that. Actually, I might have switched colors, but you'll forgive me. It starts to rise. And it follows the course of the left ventricle. So basically, it's rising with the left ventricular pressure because there's a continuous space there. There's no valve between the two. So what happened at this spot exactly? Let's just recap it. Well, the AV valve is still closed. Nothing has changed there. But the semilunar valve opened. And that's the interesting new thing. That's the cool, new thing that allowed the blood to go from the left ventricle out into the aorta. And now what happens? Well at some point, all this contraction I've drawn relaxes. It finally goes away. It goes away on both sides. And all these black arrows, I'm going to erase. And this muscle now, instead of depolarizing, begins to re-polarize. Now, why didn't I erase that last black arrow? Because again, there is some pressure in the left ventricle. And in fact, looking at my graph, you can see there's not just some, but there's a lot of pressure still in there. So all that's changed is that the muscle is now relaxing. And if the muscle is relaxing, then this yellow line begins to drift down. And if the left ventricular pressure drifts down, so does the aortic pressure. That drifts down too. Well at some point, what will happen? Well, the aortic pressure is still high. And think about this. This is actually a tricky point. It's still high because there's resistance. Remember, there's resistance from all of the blood vessels. There's resistance here. All these blood vessels are offering lots of resistance. So, with all this resistance from the blood vessels, the aortic pressure stays high. And the left ventricular pressure is relaxing. It's drifting back down. And so this arrow, instead of blood just going one way, there's a little bit of pressure coming back the other way. There's a little bit of pressure going this way, this way, and this way. And there is some pressure this way still because the left ventricle still has some pressure. So they're matched. There's pressure coming from the aorta and also pressure coming from the left ventricle. Initially, the left ventricle just overwhelmed the amount of pressure in the aorta. But as it's drifting back down, now that aortic pressure is matching the left ventricular pressure. And at this particular moment, that left ventricular pressure 1is going to be lower than the aortic pressure, something 1like that-- an interesting cross-over. 1And that's, again, because the aortic pressure stays 1high because of all that resistance, 1but the left ventricular pressure 1continues to drift down because it's relaxing. 1And the moment that the pressure in the aorta 1is greater than the pressure in the left ventricle, 1this shuts down again. 1So that valve slams shut. 1And so at that point, what would we say? 1Well we say, well, the semilunar valve closed, 1and the AV valve opened. 1Sorry, I keep saying that, and I apologize. 1The AV valve is still closed. 1I didn't mention anything with the AV valve. 1That's still closed, as it has been for the last two points 1on our graph. 1In fact, let me just label this point one, point two, 1point three. 1So at this point, what's the next thing 1that's going to happen? 1Well, the left ventricle continues to relax, 1and it goes all the way down through my word, 1semilunar closed, all the way down almost to 0. 1And before it gets there, before it gets all the way to 0, 1the pressure's so darn low in here 1that now, left atrial pressure is actually 1higher than left ventricular pressure. 1And blood can flow back through. 1So if blood can flow back through, 1then we know that as blood fills up a ventricle, 1the pressure continues to slowly rise over time. 1And it gets to about there, which 1is the same spot that we began at. 1And meanwhile, the aorta continues 1to drift down because, just as in the beginning, 1we said well, when time passes, blood drifts down 1through to all the vessels. 1So blood is now drifting away, as it did before, 1into all the vessels. 1And as it drifts away, the pressure in the aorta 1drifts back down again. 1And it goes something like that. 1Actually I guess further, because my second is not 1there-- something like that. 1And you have to assume, based on my drawing, 1that these two points are the same. 1And if they're not, then I haven't drawn it correctly. 1So that's what the aorta does at the end. 1So let me just label this now, this last point 1here, this point four. 1Sorry, before I get to point four, point three, 1the thing that was interesting and new-- I should just box it. 1I'm just trying to box the things 1I want to draw your attention to-- is 1that the semilunar valve closed. 1So what is happening at point four? 1Now at point four-- a couple things. 1The AV valve now finally opens. 1I said that prematurely before. 1And that's the new thing. 1The AV valve opened. 1And the semilunar valve is still closed. 1So that did not change. 1So this is exactly what happens at the four stages, the four 1important points. 1So, just to recap-- and actually, as I recap, 1let me mention something new that's interesting as well. 1Remember that when valves close, they usually make noise. 1So it's like a slamming of the door. 1So when a valve shuts, it makes noise. 1And so you have to look on these four points, 1when does a valve close for the first time? 1Well, the AV valve closes right here. 1This is the point where it first closed. 1So when the AV valve closes, it makes a loud thwack, 1a loud noise. 1In fact, sometimes people call it a lub. 1You hear that lub noise if you listen to your heart. 1And that's the first heart sound because that door just shut. 1And you can see, based on the pressure differences, 1it's really closing because the left ventricular 1pressure is going up so fast. 1So when you hear that first lub-dub, when 1you hear that lub, that's also the beginning 1of the high pressure, the contraction 1of the left ventricle. 1Now point two, does any door close? 1Does any valve shut? 1Not really. 1The semilunar valve opens, but opening of a valve 1doesn't really cause any noise. 1At point three, the semilunar valve closes. 1So that's where the aortic valve and pulmonary valve slam shut. 1So again, you get some noise up here. 1This causes noise. 1So at point three, if I was to draw a straight line down here, 1you'd get some noise. 1I'm going to cover up my number four, but that's OK. 1You know where it is. 1And this is the second noise. 1And it's coming from the closing of the semilunar valve. 1And then, point four, the AV valve opening, well, 1opening doesn't create noise, and the semilunar valve 1is still shut. 1So really, the two sounds, the heart sounds, S1, S2, 1come from the closing of the AV valves 1initially, the mitral and tricuspid. 1And then the dub comes from the closing 1of the aortic and pulmonary valves.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system
" In this video, we're going to take our motor that's going to be our wheel from our hair dryer, and we're going to find a way to connect it to our tap light housing. So we're marking the screw boss locations on our tap light. And that's where the screws from the tap light connected to the bottom of the tap light housing. And we're going to measure between those. And so we've got about nine centimeters between those, so four and a half centimeters will be right in the center. And we're going to mark that because we don't have a direct line connecting it. We're going to double check those measurements with our ruler on both sides. And it's important that the mark is right in the center so that our wheels line up when we put them in. So we're going to do the same on the other side. Again, it's about nine centimeters across, so four and a half between. And then we're going to just drop that mark down the side. And we're going to use the inside of our tape roll to create the arc that we need for our wheel well. And we're going to measure off of the boss, the screw boss, to the bottom. And that'll be 1.5 centimeters. And we're going to measure off of that. And then we'll transfer that 1.5 centimeters to the outside, and that'll be the top of the arc that we're going to create with our tape roll. So we're going to just line it up with the mark there. And then we'll take our Sharpie, and we'll draw our arc. So once we have our arc drawn, we can begin removing the material that we need to remove so that the motors fit inside of the tap light housing. And now we're going to put on safety gloves. And we're going to use a break off blade knife. The break off blade is probably not the best knife to use for this. I'd probably use an X-Acto knife or another kind of carving knife, but it's the one I happen to have. You can see the blade just snap there, so make sure if you do use this kind of knife that you wear safety glasses. But right now, we're just whittling away at the material. And it's very soft, very easy to cut with a knife. You can just trim it down. You want to just take the material away just a little bit at a time. And then, obviously, you want to try and make sure they stay inside that black line. You don't want to cut too far away. Otherwise your wheel well will not line up with the wheel just perfectly. Of course if you do go a little over, it's fine. It won't hurt anything, but it definitely won't look quite as good. So we're just trimming up the inside edge of that wheel well now and cleaning it up with the knife. And we'll do this on both sides, so it's the exact same process on the other side. So we're lining it up to see if it fits with the motor and it looks like it's pretty well. So we're just lining our motor up with housing, making sure that the opening is the right size. You see the vanes here on the motor, that connects the inner motor surround to the outer motor surround, the surround that basically protects you from the fan blades? We're going to have to remove some of those in order to get the fan to contact the floor. Now the fan is acting like our wheel, and in order for it to move the craft forward, we have to remove the bottom part of that outer housing around the fan, the clear plastic housing. So we're going to remove two of the vanes on the bottom and three on the top. And the two that we're going to keep we just marked with our Sharpie. So the two that we're removing on the bottom, we're using our nipper pliers. So we're snipping those off. And then we're going to take our hacksaw blade, and we're going to clamp the motor in place as best we can. And we're going to take our hacksaw blade and trim off-- just basically cut straight through the outer housing, the outer clear plastic piece that goes around the blades. We want to make sure that we line the two propeller blades up in such a way that when we cut through the outer housing, we don't cut into the propeller blades. Because we want to use those as our wheel. Now this is time lapsed, so it's going faster than normal. But I've already cut through the other side. This side's almost cut through. I'm going to use the nipper pliers to trim off the rest. Then we're going to make sure that we've got enough blade exposed, and it does look like it. We're going to clean up the edges with a break off blade knife. And that's just to clean off the burrs and the rough edges of our motor. Make sure everything is clean and exposed and ready to go. And we're just trimming off the excess there. So now you can see the motor spins freely and can connect with the floor. And on top of the motor, there's a-- we're just checking to make sure it still works and spins freely. So on top of the motor, you can see there's a Sharpie marker mark. And that was drawn from just taking the bezel and putting it over the motor. And so we want to see if we can cut that mark out. And so we're going to take our hacksaw blade, and we're going to cut the plastic housing at an angle so we can try and get as close to that line as possible. So it's at about a 20 degree angle. And we're just cutting straight down to try and cut along that line that we drew with our Sharpie. And the point of this is basically just to get that plastic surround to sort of wrap around the tap light housing. And we're cutting through it. It takes a good bit of work to get it lined up, but since we're doing it by hand we can hold it like that. Now we're taking our nipper pliers, and we're snapping those connections. And we're just going to cut right through the rest of the housing. Now we're pretty close to where we need to be. So in order to get it to fit just right, we're going to need to trim it. And we're going to use our nipper pliers to finish the trimming and make sure that we can get the kind of fit that we want. It takes a fair bit of patience, but I think it's better to take a little bit off at a time than to try and do it all at once and not get a nice, clean fit. So we're just snapping through the different parts there. And you can see that the motor fits nicely against the white plastic housing. So we've got protection on our motor, around our blades, and it fits nicely against the outside. We're taking just a little bit more material off now to make sure that the motor fits pretty well. And again, this material cuts very easily with our nipper pliers. So you could potentially cut the whole thing with the nipper pliers and not use the hacksaw if you wanted to, but I felt like it was a little easier to use the hack saw. So we're just checking our motor out, and making sure it fits, and double checking the connection between the motor and the housing. Giving it a close inspection. You can see that there's a pretty good fit there. We're trying to find out if there's any places where there may be an interference, or the parts don't come together the way we want them to. And we're also looking at how we could fasten the motor to the housing and making sure everything clears. So there are a couple of little nibs, plastic nibs, left from when we cut off the vanes using our nipper pliers. So we're just filing those down so that the motor will sit flush with the Lexan. And the motor needs to sit flush, because we're going to zip tie the motor in place. We're going to hold it in place. And if the motor has those bumps on it, it won't have quite as good a fit. So right now, we're just making marks. We made four little marks there. And those marks go on either side of the motor. And we're going to use those to run our zip tie through. So we'll run our zip tie through from one side to the other. And we're just going to use a quarter inch drill bit. All right, so now we're just removing the screws from our polystyrene housing and getting them out of the way. And we're going to drill our holes that we marked for the motor. And that will allow us to run our zip tie through. And we're just going to clean the edges of the holes up with our break off blade knife there, making sure that they line up with our motor. And they do. And those holes are roughly a quarter of an inch in diameter. Doesn't really matter exactly the size, but as long as they're just a little bigger than your zip tie, you're fine. So we're going to thread the zip tie through. We want to make sure that the bump on the end of the zip tie is on top of the Lexan so that the zip tie holds tightly against the motor. And because the motor has got two levels of plastic, we're putting a little shim in there, just a little piece of extra plastic. And that'll help hold the motor flat. And now we're going to pull the zip tie down. We'll pull it down all the way and snap it in place. You can see now the motor's pretty securely in place. We're going to go ahead and grab another zip tie and do the other side. So we'll grab-- oh we're just pushing the shim the rest of the way in. I forgot to mention that. We want to make sure the shim is tightly secured in there. And the shim is just made out of another-- it's same type of Lexan, same thickness. We just cut a little piece of it that's about half an inch square and stuck it underneath that part of the motor. All right, so one more zip tie on this motor. And the other motor's done exactly the same way, but we're going to run the zip tie through and connect it. Again, the raised portion of the zip tie needs to be above the Lexan. We'll feed the bottom of the zip tie through and pull it tight against the motor. This'll give us the ability to adjust the motor if we need to. Make sure that it's lined up along the imaginary axis between two, where the two motors will be. And as we're tightening that down, we may want to grab a screwdriver to finish tightening it the rest of the way. And we'll leave the zip ties long so we can make some changes later, if we need to undo the zip ties. So basically, that's how to mount the motors for your Bit-zee Bot. The other one's done exactly the same way. Thanks.",science_electrical-engineering_robots
" -  So, now that we've talked about the epidermis, or our top most layer of skin, let's descend further down, and talk about the dermis, these next two layers of skin, and then we'll also talk about the hypodermis, which is the bottom most layer of skin here. So as you can see, your dermis has two layers to it, and again, it sits right below your epidermis, so your epidermis, the top most layer of skin sits up here, and if you can recall, the bottom most layer of your epidermis is called the ""stratum basale,"" the basal layer of your epidermis. So below that we have our first layer of the dermis which is called the ""papillary dermis."" This is the topmost layer of the dermis, and then below the papillary dermis, we have what's called the ""reticular dermis,"" the reticular dermis, right here. The main difference between the dermis versus the epidermis is the type of tissue we have here. Recall that in the epidermis, we had ""epithelial tissue."" So, I'll write epithelial tissue, up here. And then within the dermis both layers are going to have something that's called ""connective tissue."" You've probably seen that written out as CT (connective tissue). So connective tissue is different in that it doesn't necessarily involve cells. Epithelial tissue involves things like simple squamous epithelial cells, columnar epithelial cells. Even transitional epithelial cells, that you may have seen in the bladder. And your connective tissue contains a litany of other proteins. Things like actin which is what you must have heard of when we talked about the muscular system, or collagen which is another structural protein. These are some of the most popular proteins you see mentioned when we talk about connective tissue, but they also include things like laminin, elastin, desmin. Connective tissue mainly holds things together. If you remember a tendon, a tendon is connective tissue that holds the muscle onto a bone, and between the papillary dermis, and the reticular dermis, there are two types of connective tissue we see here. In the papillary dermis we have very thin, loose connective tissue, and this allows for all the stuff in the papillary dermis to sort of move around and change shape and position, versus what we have in the reticular dermis which is thicker, more dense, or denser connective tissue. Denser connective tissue, and the purpose of this is to make things stay still. We anchor things down in the reticular dermis, and we'll talk exactly about what we're anchoring down here in a moment, but as we hop back up to the papillary dermis, there are a variety of things that we have here that have to change shape and position and are able to do so because the connective tissue is so loose. One of the main things we find in the papillary dermis are blood vessels. If you recall when you have an arterial from an artery branch off into a capillary, so you've got these purple capillaries right here, and then come back together to make a venule, a venule which goes off to a vein. Realize now that this is the most superficial or the topmost layer of your skin that actually has blood vessels here. So one of the roles is that the capillaries have to deliver oxygen and nutrients that nourish not only your dermis, but actually go up into the epidermis as well because the epidermis doesn't have any blood vessels. It relies entirely on the papillary dermis to nourish it, and thank goodness this is thin, loose connective tissue because there's plenty of room here for the capillaries to engorge with blood, fill up with nutrients, and then these nutrients can diffuse across and go up from the dermis into the epidermis, and even go lower, if necessary. The other thing we have in our dermis are nerve endings. These nerve endings, and I'll write this just because my drawing is not as obvious. These nerve endings that sit in our dermis allow us to perceive things like touch and even pain, and then that will pass on a signal across the nerve going in this direction right here, like that, and this signal is relayed all the way to a cell body, and this cell body can sit somewhere much further away than the skin. Now as we get to the reticular dermis we'll see why it's important to have thick, dense connective tissue down here, and this connective tissue helps anchor things down. One of the things that you can have, and I'll sort of draw it like this ascending to your epidermis and so it leaks out over here. This is a gland. You'll have tons of sweat glands and exocrine glands of other varieties that start in your reticular dermis, and are anchored and held down here that extend out with a duct to secrete their contents to the epidermis to the outside world, kind of at the top layer of your skin. So you've got plenty of glands that sit here. In addition, you'll also have this follicle right here. This follicle will have from it emerging a hair. This hair ... I guess I should label this also. The hair, of course, is going to protrude at the top of your skin. It's not that you just have a hair that sits inside and then this guy right here is just your hair follicle, and so your hair follicle is anchored within your reticular dermis, and the hair itself is allowed to grow and extend out to the top and protrude from your epidermis. One of the other things that we have kind of sitting in your dermis that's anchoring itself onto the hair, or the hair follicle, is this slab of muscle that we've got right here. So this guy, I'll write if off there, this is an ""arrector pili muscle."" An arrector pili muscle, and this is involved in extending or having your hair stand straight up when you're cold or when you're scared. Finally, now that we've talked about the dermis, we can move to our last layer of skin. Although, it's technically not skin, but it's called the ""hypodermis."" This is the hypodermis, which is a great name because as you might recall, hypo just means ""below"" and this layer sits right below the dermis. Another name for it is subcutaneous fat, and I think that that's also a great name for what we have here. Subcutaneous, if you might remember, cutaneous is just another name for skin, so subcutaneous fat, and that's exactly what we have down here. We have tons of layers of fat that could vary from person to person, and although fat gets a lot of flack we have to realize that it's very important because there are two main functions they help us achieve. First of all fat absorbs shock. People that are more insulated with fat are able to withstand traumatic injuries, maybe more effectively than others, and the other thing that it does for us is that it insulates our tissue, because realize that now that we've finished talking about our skin, we've talked about the epidermis, the dermis and now we've even covered the hypodermis. What sits right below this? You're going to find muscle. Muscle sits down here. It's below that and perhaps even bone. You know, if you're talking about your chest wall right above your rib, if you put your finger right kind of where your clavicle is above your rib cage, or even on your ribs, realize that your epidermis, dermis, and your hypodermis are all that separate your finger from your rib bone, or even your muscle if you're pressing on your bicep or your calf. We spent a lot of time kind of talking about the components of what's in our skin, but how does this even help us clinically? How do doctors use this to diagnose diseases? The best one to talk about as an example here would be for the diagnosis of burns. Now a burn is a horrible thing that could happen and one of the things that we do to differentiate the types of burns you can have is to say what degree of a burn you sustained, and interestingly enough the different layers of your skin correspond to the different degrees of burn you can have. You can have a first-degree burn, which is just sort of a reddening that can occur on your epidermis. You can have a second-degree burn, which is characterized by burning into the dermis, so much so that you don't have nerve pain after some time. That's the difference between a first-degree and a second-degree. A first-degree hurts awfully, but if you have a place that's been burned that doesn't hurt so much anymore, it's because you've burned and killed off nerve tissue here, and so they're not able to send a signal up to the cell body. And then finally there's a third-degree burn, which is going past the hypodermis into things like your fat, the muscle that's below, the bone that's below as well, and, of course, the third-degree burn is characterized by not having any pain, and having more of a darker coloration to it, because now you're burning more than just connective tissue. You're actually burning bone or muscle, or fat, as well. It's this exact anatomy, right here, that we've talked about that allow doctors to distinguish between whether 1a patient has sustained 1a first, second, or third-degree burn, 1and that's something you can do now as well.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" -  So this little boy here has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and we want to look at how we might go about managing this condition. Now you might have noticed there that I said that we want to manage it, I didn’t say anything about curing his cerebral palsy, and that’s because cerebral palsy is a lifelong disorder. The damage that has occurred in the movement centers of the brain and caused cerebral palsy, it’s permanent. We don’t really have a way of undoing or totally fixing this damage. So we can’t really cure or even completely treat cerebral palsy. So instead what we want to do is focus on reducing or managing the problems that someone with cerebral palsy experiences. So in order for us to figure out what we might need to do, let’s start off by checking out this spectrum here that shows us the range of movement impairments that someone with cerebral palsy can experience. Now, people with cerebral palsy don’t just have movement impairments, and we’ll talk more about some of the other problems that can arise shortly. But for now I just want to focus in on this one aspect of cerebral palsy. So the spectrum here is pretty wide, right? So at the mild end of our spectrum we’ve got a kid here who seems to be able to walk and run around without much assistance. And then on the severe end of our spectrum we’ve got a kid here in a wheelchair who needs a lot of assistance to get around. So these are kind of the two extreme ends of the spectrum of movement impairments that we can see in someone with cerebral palsy. So someone with cerebral palsy can fall kind of anywhere along this wide spectrum, and where they fall, well that depends on the kind of brain damage that they have and how bad that damage is. So when we look at this spectrum you can probably imagine that someone over here on the spectrum is gonna have very different needs than someone over here on the spectrum. So what we need to do to manage this person’s cerebral palsy well, it might look a little different compared to what we need to do to manage this person’s cerebral palsy. So considering the diversity of movement impairments that different people with cerebral palsy can have, well you can imagine how diverse managing cerebral palsy can be between these different people cause we need to individualize our management plans to make sure that we’re addressing the strengths and the limitations that each person with cerebral palsy has. So let’s check out some of the tools that we have to manage cerebral palsy. So if we start off on the mild end of our spectrum here, what might we see over here? Well for someone on the mild end of our spectrum if they have spastic cerebral palsy, so the most common type of cerebral palsy, where the affected muscles are really stiff, well they might have a bit of this muscle stiffness. And you might remember that this stiffness occurs because the muscles are actually too active. They’re getting too many messages from the neurons that control them, and that’s what makes them really stiff. So one thing that we can do to help reduce this muscle stiffness, is we can try to intervene here with medications that block some of those extra signals going from the neurons to the muscles. So one of these medications that we often use for just this purpose in someone with cerebral palsy is actually botox. The same botox that you’ve probably seen on late night tv commercials about getting rid of wrinkles on your face. So it’s actually interesting how botox works. It’s actually a neurotoxin, it relaxes muscles. So in the case of those wrinkles in the tv commercials, botox relaxes the muscles that cause the wrinkles. And so for cerebral palsy it does a really similar thing. It actually does the exact same thing. It makes the stiff muscles in spastic cerebral palsy less stiff, but there’s a bit of a catch. Botox doesn’t really like to travel very far, so it needs to be injected straight into the muscles that we want to make less stuff. So we do our little botox injection and then the toxin, what it does is it actually prevents the neurons from being able to talk to and stimulate the muscles, and it does this by blocking the release of a chemical called acetylcholine from these neurons. And it’s the acetylcholine that the neurons are sending to the muscles to stimulate them and make them active. So when botox this acetylcholine message from even reaching the muscles, the muscles aren’t able to be so active anymore, and this helps reduce that muscle stiffness. Now, spastic cerebral palsy isn’t the only type of cerebral palsy that we can manage by using medications. So for dyskinetic cerebral palsy, where the main problem is too much movement, the problem again is that the muscles are just too active. But this time we don’t manage the problem by using medications at the site of the muscle like we did with spastic cerebral palsy. Instead we manage the problem by using medications that work on the control center, the brain. So whereas before we used botox injections in specific spastic muscles that we knew to be really stiff, with dyskinetic cerebral palsy we kind of have to tone down the activity of all of the muscles, the whole system. We can’t just treat one area or one muscle group like we can with spastic cerebral palsy. So to have this global full body effect we use a medication called an anticholinergic. So this helps reduce those extra movements that someone with dyskinetic cerebral palsy experiences. Because remember, acetylcholine is one of the chemicals that’s required to make movements of our muscles. And an anticholinergic is going to reduce the activity of acetylcholine at all places in your body, right? Anticholinergic; so less movement. Now you might remember that there’s also a third type of cerebral palsy. Ataxic cerebral palsy, where the person is really shaky and unstable on their feet. Now, with this type of cerebral palsy we don’t really have a medication that can help with the shakiness or the instability, but it’s not uncommon for people with ataxic cerebral palsy to also have spastic cerebral palsy, or dyskinetic cerebral palsy. So sometimes people with ataxic cerebral palsy may also be on some of these medications to help with their spasticity or their dyskinesia. So as we move down our severity spectrum here we often need to add a few more things to our management plan. So while we’re on the topic of medications, one problem that can arise is that this spasticity, this muscle stiffness, can often be worse or more widespread in someone who’s further down our severity spectrum here. So when this is the case sometimes botox isn’t enough to deal with their spasticity. Remember, with botox we need to inject it straight into that muscle that’s effected, because botox does not like to travel very far. But if we have too many effected muscles that’s a lot of botox injections. So when spasticity is too widespread to be managed by botox alone, we need something else that can act in a more widespread kind of way. So we actually have a medication called baclofen that comes in and blocks the activity of the neurons in the brain that are ultimately responsible for that increased muscle activity that causes stiffness. So we can induce some global muscle relaxation with this medication. Now, as we’ve moved down our spectrum here you can see that crutches or maybe wheelchairs might be needed to help the person with cerebral palsy get around, because some parts of the body might be too stiff or maybe too shaky for them to get around without some extra support. And one thing that we need to look out for when this is the case is we need to make sure that any muscles that aren’t being used as much as they normally would, we don’t want those muscles getting too weak, or stuck or twisted in abnormal positions. Because when this is left over time it can lead to joint dislocations that can cause muscle, tendon, or bone damage that might require surgery later on to fix. So an important part of managing cerebral palsy, and this is true across our whole spectrum here and across the different types of cerebral palsy, is making sure that those effected muscles are used and stretched as much as possible to try to prevent damage from disuse or abnormal positions later on. And actually, most people with cerebral palsy, regardless of where they fall on the spectrum, will attend regular physiotherapy to keep their muscles as healthy as possible. So if we head down to the far end of our spectrum here this is where we might see the need for surgery to correct for problems that can occur when the muscles are very stiff and joints like the hip can become damaged from the legs being in abnormal positions that put strain on the joint. Sometimes surgery is also used to try to lengthen those muscles and tendons that have been shortened because the muscles are so stiff and contracted. So at the end of this spectrum there are some other problems that can crop up that might also need to be managed. So sometimes the muscles in the mouth and the throat, that are really important for eating and swallowing, well these muscles can also become really stiff and this can make it really hard for the person to eat normally, so they might need a feeding tube to make sure that they’re getting all of the nutrients that they need. They might also have trouble closing their mouth properly, and controlling their saliva because the facial muscles can become really stiff. So drooling may become a problem that needs to be managed with medications like botox injections into the effected muscles. And remember, right now we’re talking about people that are a bit further down our spectrum here. This isn’t what happens for everyone with cerebral palsy. And remember that cerebral palsy is ultimately caused by damage to movement centers in the brain. So sometimes this damage can lead to other disorders like epilepsy, which is where the person has recurrent seizures. And this is actually really common in people 1with cerebral palsy. 1About half of people with cerebral palsy 1also have epilepsy. 1So we would need to manage other disorders 1like epilepsy with its own medications. 1So for epilepsy these medications are called 1anticonvulsants. 1So these are some of the ways that we can work 1to manage cerebral palsy, and management will 1sort of be tailored to where a person might be 1on this spectrum.",science_health-and-medicine_mental-health
" After coursing throughout the blood vessels of our bodies, a hormone eventually meets a receptor that was created specifically for it by the target cells that it was sent to stimulate. And the way that hormone interacts with the receptor happens in one of two very characteristic ways. And I want to show you today how that happens. And so the first major mechanism of hormone action at the cell that I'm going to start with is by secondary messengers. And I'm going to start with secondary messengers because, historically, they're a little bit more confusing. But essentially what's happening is a hormone is binding to a receptor on a cell. So let me draw a cell and its receptor. And I'll draw a hormone binding to it. But the process of that binding, instead of just stimulating the effect, it really sets off this chain reaction that leads to secondary messengers inside the cell being released. So let me draw those. And you've got these secondary messengers being released, and these are actually what's stimulating whatever effect is desired, whether that may be insulin being released or glucose being taken up inside the cell, or any of the other countless things taking place in our bodies that are controlled by hormones. And so in order to give you a visual for how this might take place in the cell, I've pre-drawn some pictures in the key. So let me pull those in here. And I want you to be sure that these drawings are not to scale in any way. But really, this is the best I can at least do in explaining the process, because all of this is happening at the atomic level, and atoms are really tiny. But anyway, what we have in this picture is a receptor. And I've drawn that in pink, and it's located inside the cell membrane. So this is the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane, and we've got the inside of the cell, and the outside. And then also in the cell membrane, we've got a G protein, and I've drawn that in green. It's called a G protein because it binds to molecules that include the nucleotide guanine. And that's the same G from the DNA bases that you might be a little bit more familiar with. But it's currently bound to a molecule called guanine diphosphate. And then we'll see how that changes. But we also have this adenylate cyclase enzyme that's in the cell membrane. And remember that an enzyme speeds up reaction. So we're going to see how adenlyate cyclase speeds up a reaction. But what starts this process off is the hormone is going to bind to the receptor. So it's going to look like that. And you're going to have the hormone bound to the receptor. And once that hormone binds to the receptor, it's going to change shape. And that's going to allow it to interact with the G protein here. And so that looks like this. And what you saw happen was that as the G protein interacts with the receptor in a hormone complex, it's going to exchange that GDP that it started with, that guanine diphosphate for GTP. So essentially, it's exchanging a guanine bound to two phosphates for a guanine bound to three phosphates. And what happens is that enables the G protein to move through the cell membrane and interact with adenylate cyclase. And so that activates the adenylate cyclase. And as an enzyme, that activated adenylate cyclase facilitates the conversion of ATP, which is the energy currency of the cell, into cAMP. And cAMP stands for cyclic adenosine monophosphate. So we've taken this ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, and created a cyclic adenosine monophosphate. And we also have the additional two phosphates. But it is this cAMP molecule that activates the protein inside the cell whose effect is really being targeted by the hormone in the first place. And so eventually, this system resets, but not before several adenlyate cyclase enzymes were activated, resulting in a lot of cAMP being produced. And so we call this signal amplification. And what I mean by signal amplification is that, in theory, one hormone can bind to a receptor. And that process can set off a chain reaction that leads to a lot of cAMP being produced. And so it can mean that less hormone is required to ultimately activate the protein or the effect that's being desired. And so secondary messengers are a means in which hormones act on the cell. But really, if I'm being honest, this effect happens differently for a lot of cells. And all of the mechanisms of secondary messenger hormone action aren't known right now. And honestly, there are a lot of secondary messengers other than cAMP. But really, the takeaway is that for the majority of the hormones in your body, binding to the cell surface activates a series of reactions that initiate a response inside the cell. And so it's very similar to the use of a phone service provider. And because we as people-- let me draw us-- because we're unable to communicate directly with people sometimes, because of separation or convenience or lack of efficiency, we use a phone service to project our voice to them through a phone conversation. So through a phone conversation, we'll direct our voice to people that we want to communicate with. Or maybe we use the delivery of a text message. A text message will transmit some intended message that we have for people that we can't communicate directly with, for whatever reason. And so that's very similar to how secondary messengers assist hormones that can't communicate with a receptor directly inside of the cell. And so peptide hormones and catecholamines, both of which can't cross the cell membrane, use secondary messengers to communicate. And then the other major method of hormone action on a cell is as a primary messenger. Certain hormones, like steroids and thyroid hormones, can actually cross the cell membrane. And it eliminates this entire middleman system that we set up before. So let me pull in another cell membrane. And so the hormone crosses the cell membrane and it binds to a receptor that's located either in the cytosol or in the nucleus. And so we could imagine a nucleus, and there might be DNA inside. But when the hormone binds to the receptor that's either in the cytoplasm or inside the nucleus, that binding process is going to directly affect transcription in the nucleus, or translation in the cytoplasm, of the protein that's being activated by the hormone. And this process has quite a few less moving parts than the secondary messenger system did. But again, it stems back to the fact that these are steroid and thyroid hormones that are typically lipid-based and are capable of crossing through the cell membrane on their own. And so they don't need all of that extra machinery set up for them. But anyway, these are both primary messengers and secondary messengers. And those are the two main processes by which hormones act on the cell that they're created to target.",science_health-and-medicine_advanced-endocrine-system
" Plot the real zeroes of the given polynomial on the graph below. And they give us p of x is equal to 2 x to the 5th plus x to the 4th minus 2x minus 1. And when they say plot it, they give us this little widget here. Where if we click at any point on this, we get our point. And we get as many points as we would like. And we can drag these points around. Or if we don't want these points anymore, we can just dump them in this little trash bin at the bottom right. So let's think about what the zeroes of this polynomial actually are. And to do that I'll take my scratch pad out. And this is a little daunting at first. This is a 5th degree polynomial here. Factoring 5th degree polynomials is really something of an art. You're really going to have to sit and look for patterns. If they're actually expecting you to find the zeroes here without the help of a computer, without the help of a calculator, then there must be some type of pattern that you can pick out here. So let me just rewrite p of x. So p of x is equal to 2 x to the 5th plus x to the 4th minus 2x minus 1. And one way that's typically seen when you're trying to factor this type of polynomial is to try to essentially undo the distributive property a few times. And if you want to relate it to techniques for factoring quadratics, it's essentially factoring by grouping. So for example, you see a 2x minus 1, or something that looks like a 2x minus 1 right over here. And over here you have a 2x to the 5th plus x to the 4th. So you have a 2x of a higher degree term plus a 1 x of a one degree lower. So there seems to be some type of a pattern. 2 times x of a higher degree-- this is a first degree term-- minus 1 times-- you could do this as x to the 0-- of a lower degree term. And so let's think about it a little bit. What happens if we essentially try to group these two terms, and we group these two terms right over here. And we try to factor out anything to essentially clean it up a little bit, to see if we can make sense of it. Well these two terms, their greatest common factor is x to the 4th. We could write this as x to the 4th times 2x plus 1. And this should get us excited because this looks pretty close to that, especially if we were to factor out a negative 1 here. So we could factor out a negative 1. And then this is going to be 2x plus 1. And that's exciting because now we can factor out a 2 x plus 1 from each of these terms. So you have a 2x plus 1. We're gonna factor both of these out, to get 2x plus 1-- which we just factored out. And if you factored it out of this term right over here, you're left with x to the 4th. And if you factor it out this term, you're left with just the minus 1. Minus 1. And now this is exciting because 2x plus 1, this is pretty easy to figure out when does this thing equal 0. And we'll do that in a little bit. And this is pretty easy to factor. This is a difference of squares. This right over here can be rewritten as x squared plus 1 times x squared minus 1. And of course we still have this 2x plus 1 out front. 2x plus 1. And once again we have another difference of squares. We have another difference of squares right over here. That's the same thing as x plus 1 times x minus 1. And let me just write all the other parts of this expression. x squared plus 1. And you have 2x plus 1. 2x plus 1. And I think I factored p of x about as much as could be reasonably expected. So p of x is equal to all of this business. And remember, the whole reason why I wanted to factor it is I wanted to figure out when does this thing equal 0? So if p of x can be expressed as the product of a bunch of these expressions, it's going to be 0 whenever at least one of these expressions is equal to 0. If any of these is equal to 0 then that's just going to make this whole expression equal to 0. So when does 2x plus 1 equal 0? So 2x plus 1 is equal to zero. Well you could probably do this in your head, or we could do it systematically as well. Subtract 1 from both sides, you get 2x equals negative 1. Divide both sides by 2, you get x is equal to negative 1/2. So when x equals negative 1/2-- or one way to think about it, p of negative 1/2 is 0. So p of negative 1/2 is 0. So this right over here is a point on the graph, and it is one of the real zeroes. Now we could try to solve this. x squared plus 1 equals 0, and I'll just write it down just to show you. If we try to isolate the x term on the left-- subtract 1 from both sides-- you get x squared is equal to negative 1. Now if we were to start thinking about imaginary numbers, we could think about what x could be. But they want us to find the real zeroes. The real zeroes. So there's no real number where that number squared is equal to negative 1. So we're not going to get any real zeroes by setting this thing equal to 0. There's no real number x where x squared plus 1 is going to be equal to 0. Now let's think about when x plus 1 could be equal to 0. We'll subtract 1 from both sides. You get x is equal to negative 1. So p of negative 1 is going to be 0. So that's another one of our zeroes right there. And then finally let's think about when x minus 1 is equal to 0. We'll add one to both sides. X is equal to 1. So we have another real 0 right over there. And so we could plot them. So it's negative 1, negative 1/2, and 1. So it's negative 1, negative 1/2 and 1. And we can check our answer, and we got it right. Now one thing that might be bugging you, is like hey Sal, you just happened to group this in exactly the right way. What if I try to group it in a different way? What if I tried to-- Well actually let's try to do that. That could be interesting. Just to show you that this isn't voodoo. And actually there's several ways to get there. There's several ways to get there. So what if instead of writing it like this, where you're writing it kind of in the highest degree term and the next highest degree and so on and so forth, you were to write it like this: p of x is equal to 2 x to the 5th minus 2x plus x to the 4th minus 1. Well actually, even this way you could do a fairly interesting grouping. If you grouped these two together, you see that they have the common factor 2 x. You factor 2x out, you get 2x times x to the 4th minus 1. And I think you see what's going on. And then this can be rewritten as plus 1 times x to the 4th minus 1. Minus 1. And now you can factor out an x to the 4th minus 1. And you're left with-- I'll do this in a neutral color-- x to the fourth minus 1 times 2 x plus 1, which is much easier to factor now. A difference of squares. Exactly what we did the last time around. So there are several ways that you could have reasonably grouped this, and reasonably undone the distributive property. But I do admit it is something of an art. You really just have to play around in see, well let's group the first two terms, let's see if there's a common factor here. Let's group the second two terms, let's see if there's a common factor here. Hey, once we factor out those common factors, it looks like both of these two terms have this common expression as a factor. And then you could start to factor that out.",math_algebra-home_alg-polynomials
" - [Presenter] I think that talking about risk factors for drug abuse can be really difficult. And that's just because there are so many different factors that feed into it. And also, I don't want to put too much emphasis on any one cause. I don't want to demonize any one thing. So I want to say right off the bat, that there is no one thing that can lead to drug abuse or addiction. Instead, there are numerous factors that relate to each other in complicated ways. And I also want to mention that the presence of any, or even all of these risk factors does not actually guarantee that an individual will become addicted to any substance, or will even use at all. Alright, well with all of that said, now I am going to talk about some risk factors for substance abuse. So things that seem to correlate with substance abuse later in life. And we're going to talk about biological risk factors, psychological risk factors, and sociocultural and environmental risk factors. And let's start off with the biological factors. We know that if a child has a parent who abuses substances, they are more likely to abuse them as well. And this in combination with the fact that identical twins have more similar rates of addiction than fraternal twins, seems to imply that there could be a genetic component to addiction. This is also supported by the fact that adopted children tend to resemble their biological parents more than their adopted parents in term of addiction rates. But even if genetics are involved, even if someone can have a genetic predisposition to substance abuse, this does not guarantee that a person will develop a substance abuse problem. Instead, it might make them more vulnerable to having one. Another biological risk factor, has to do with the D2 receptor, which is a type of dopamine receptor in the reward circuitry of the brain. Some studies suggest that individuals with fewer D2 receptors, might have a higher risk of addiction than those with a typical amount of receptors. We know that many substances are associated with an increase in dopamine within the rewards circuits in the brain. And we also know that the body tries to counteract the effects of drugs through down regulation, so over time the body will take away dopamine receptors if too much dopamine is present. And this would stop an individual from feeling pleasurable experiences both when they take the drug, meaning that they'll have to take more to get the same high, but also in basically everything else in their life. And you can see how all of this would be particularly bad for individuals who had fewer D2 receptors to begin with. Having fewer receptors might also explain why individuals seek out drugs in the first place. Because it takes more stimulation for them to naturally get a reward signal. Another biological risk factor for addiction has to do with comorbidity. Meaning that individuals with certain psychiatric disorders, might be more likely to have substance abuse problems as well. One of these disorders is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD. And this actually make a lot of sense to me, because individuals with ADHD tend to be impulsive. And as we will talk about later when we talk about psychological risk factors, impulsivity in general, seems to be a risk factor for addiction. Other disorders that can sometimes go hand in hand with addiction, are anxiety disorders and depression. And we're not entirely sure why this is the case, but some researchers have suggested that it might be because these individuals are trying to self medicate for their conditions. However, we should also remember that this is a correlation, and even though we might be tempted to conclude that mental disorders lead to substance abuse, that might not be the case. It could be that substance abuse leads to mental disorders. Or perhaps could trigger mental disorders in those who have a genetic predisposition. Or maybe both mental illness and substance abuse problems could be generated by a third factor. Maybe some genetic vulnerability for both. Either way, it's important to keep in mind when we discuss all of these risk factors, that correlation does not imply causation. Now let's move on to psychological risk factors. One thing that tends to get asked a lot, is if there is such as thing as an addictive personality. And the answer is, kind of. While there is no one single personality trait that causes a person to become addicted, researchers have identified a number of personality traits that seem to be present in many individuals with substance abuse problems. One of these is impulsivity, and I don't mean that in a fun, let's drop everything and go to the beach, kind of way. When we talk about impulsivity here, we mean an inability to control oneself. The inability to inhibit one's actions, even when faced with negative consequences. This is also sometimes referred to, as behavioral disinhibition. Another component is sensation seeking. The need to seek out high levels of external stimulation and new experiences. So a constant need for new, more thrilling things in life. Things like skydiving or extreme sports, or trying novel foods. Risk sensitivity also plays a role. So individuals who focus solely on the benefits of the experiences without thinking about the risks. Or maybe failing to see how the risks might apply to them. The last personality factor that I want to talk about is neuroticism, or being abnormally tense and anxious, and sensitive to stress. And these individuals might be at risk, because they might attempt to minimize their stress reactions through self medication. There are other psychological factors that can play a role, that aren't personality traits. For example, we also know that individuals who tend to score high on aggression tests, so individuals who have feelings of aggression and aggressive behaviors, who also tend to act out at school or at home, they also seem to be at a higher risk of developing addiction later in life. Age can also play an important role. People who begin using substances as adolescents, have a much great chance of having a substance abuse disorder later in life. Let's move on to environmental risk factors. And here especially, it is important to keep in mind, that the presence of any one of these factors, does not guarantee that a person is going to use or abuse substances. Instead, we are looking at a pattern of environmental factors that might make an individual more vulnerable to addiction. And one of the most important environmental factors seems to be the presence of stress in an individual's life. Both childhood stress, as well as current stress. And we know this both from examining the lives of those individuals who have substance abuse problems, as well as from a number of animal studies. Animals who are placed in stressful environments, tend to self administer more substances than animals who are not exposed to stressors. And when we talk about stressors, we mean a lot of different things. Some of them might be family related. Children in families with marital instability tend to have a higher risk, as are individuals who suffer abuse, whether that be physical or sexual or psychological. And before we talked about how evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies all seem to show that genes play a role in developing addiction, but it is also possible that there might be an added environmental effect as well in the form of modeling and imitation. So if a child watches a parent drink or use other substances as a coping mechanism, they might be more likely to model this behavior for themselves when they face stressors in adulthood. Lack of family involvement and family supervision also seems to increase the risk for substance abuse. As does not having a close family bond between an individual and their parents and their siblings. The friends an individual has can also play a role. If a friend group approves of substances and uses them, an individual is more likely to start. And this might be true for a number of reasons, one is that we make friends with people because of shared interests. And so we might hold things that our friends believe in high esteem. Another reason is social facilitation. Substances are often consumed in a group setting, and so they can serve to enhance social bonds. We have not mentioned it yet, but of course peer pressure can also play a role. Individuals might be pressured into using substances by their peers. Either directly, by them saying that the individual should use those substances, or indirectly, by giving the impression that it is, or will be an important part of peer bonding. The community an individual is in can also play a role. There is a higher concentration of substance abuse within low SES communities, and communities that are faced with poverty. Those who lack education and don't really have an employment history, seem to be at the greatest risk. But I want to point out something important, which is that while there might be more substance abuse within these low SES communities, there isn't necessarily more substance use. It could be that those in impoverished communities lack the safety net, things like education and strong support networks, and ficial stability, that keep those in higher SES communities from moving from use to abuse. The availability of substances can also make a big difference. When substances are available, people are more likely to use. And the type of drug can also make a difference. Those with a fast rate of administration, so those that are injected or snorted or smoked, are more likely to be abused than those that are ingested orally, because they take effect faster. Because they produce a faster high, a faster reward. And this causes the brain to form a stronger association. Which might make it more likely that they will crave the drug again in the future. These substances also fade faster, which also makes users more likely to use again to continue the high. And you might think that all of these environmental factors are less important than some of the biological and psychological factors that we talked about before, but I want you to know that this just isn't the case. And so I want to take a minute 1to talk about a study that highlights how important they are 1You might be familiar with studies 1that show that a rat alone in a cage, with access to drugs 1will basically use continuously, 1sometimes neglecting food and water. 1But I want to point out that these rats 1are left alone in a cage with literally nothing else to do. 1And so they're in an environment 1without a lot of other options, 1except for using the substance. 1And to figure out what effect 1this might be having on the studies, 1some researchers built what was called the rat park. 1Which was a large cage filled with lots of engaging toys 1and fun things to play with, things like balls, and tunnels. 1And it also had the best rat food that they could get, 1and it had lots of rats all living together, 1all with access to the enriching food and activities. 1Basically it was rat paradise. 1And wouldn't you know it, 1even though the researchers made drugs available in rat park 1the same way that they were made available 1in experiments with a solitary rat in an unstimulating cage, 1the rats in rat park didn't abuse substances. 1And for those few rats who did use, 1it was in much smaller amounts. 1And this is absolutely incredible to me. 1And I still remember how shocked I was 1when I first learned it. 1And even though it's really hard 1to compare animal models to human models, 1I think it's important to consider 1what this might have to say about human substance abuse. 1So we've talked about biological risk factors, 1psychological risk factors, and environmental risk factors. 1But I want to note that even though 1I've discussed them separately, 1these three things are actually interconnected. 1Certain environmental factors might put 1an individual at a greater risk for drug abuse, 1but it is only when those things are combined 1with biological and psychological predispositions 1that they would start to take effect. 1Or saying that a different way, 1individuals with a biological predisposition 1and certain psychological traits, 1might only be at risk if they're placed within 1certain environmental situations.",science_health-and-medicine_mental-health
" -  Here I have three pictures of the same carbocation. And a carbocation has a carbon that's positively charged, which we call a cation in chemistry. So, if you take these words, carbon and cation, and combine them, you get carbocation. Let's look at the picture in the middle first. So, this carbon is positively charged. Normally, carbon has four bonds to it, but here it has only three. So, here's one, here's two, and here's three. And because it has only three bonds, it has a plus one formal charge. And carbocations are very reactive, because carbon likes to form four bonds. Let's look at the same carbocation over here on the left, and the carbon in magenta, the one with the plus one formal charge is this one. And since we aren't drawing in our atoms on this bond line structure, sometimes students forget that because this carbon in magenta has a plus one formal charge, that means it must have a hydrogen bonded to it. So, don't forget about that when you're looking at bond line structures. Finally, let's look at this same carbocation on the right. The carbon in magenta is right here. That's the one with the plus one formal charge on it. Because the carbon in magenta has only three bonds to it, this carbon is sp2 hybridized. And we know from earlier videos an sp2 hybridized carbon is going to have an unhybridized p orbital. So, here is our unhybridized p orbital, and also the geometry around that sp2 hybridized carbon is planar. So, let me see if I can sketch in a plane here, indicating the atoms that are directly bonded to that carbon are in a plane around that carbon here. Now let's look at a model of this same carbocation. Here is our sp2 hybridized carbon, and here is our unfilled p orbital. On the left, a methyl group is directly bonded to that positively charged carbon, and on the right we have another methyl group. So, two alkyl groups are bonded to that positively charged carbon, and we call this a secondary carbocation since it has two alkyl groups directly attached to the positive charge. And these alkyl groups can help to stabilize our carbocation. So, let me go ahead and show that. So, some of this electron density in here in this bond can be donated to this empty p orbital, and opposites attract, so donating some electron density helps to stabilize the carbocation. So, alkyl groups stabilize carbocations. This alkyl group on the right can do the same thing, so some electron density from in here can help to stabilize our carbocation, but notice in the back, our hydrogen, right, the electron density in this bond can't be donated into the p orbital, so the geometry isn't right. So, alkyl groups stabilize carbocations, and hydrogens do not. So, it makes sense that the more alkyl groups you have the more stable your carbocation. We just saw that alkyl groups stabilize a carbocation by donating electron density to the empty p orbital. This effect is called hyperconjugation. So, as you increase in the number of alkyl groups you should increase in the stabilization of your carbocation. So, let's look at this carbocation on the left. There's only one alkyl group directly bonded to this positively charged carbon, so we would call this a primary carbocation. In the middle, we have two alkyl groups directly bonded to this positively charged carbon. That would be a secondary carbocation, like the example in the picture above, and finally, if we have three alkyl groups directly bonded to our positively charged carbon, that would be a tertiary carbocation. The more alkyl groups you have the more you stabilize your carbocation. So, a tertiary carbocation is more stable than a secondary carbocation. And a secondary carbocation is much more stable than a primary carbocation. So, these are so unstable they might not even exist. So, we'll focus on secondary and tertiary carbocations. Now that we understand carbocation stability, let's look at an introduction to carbocation rearrangements. One possible rearrangement is something called a hydride shift. So first, let's study what a hydride ion is. We know that hydrogen has one valence electron. And if you take away the one valence electron from hydrogen, you would be left with H plus, which we know is a proton. But, if you added an electron to a neutral hydrogen atom you would now have two valence electrons. Let me draw that in there. Which would give this a negative one formal charge. And that is hydride ion. So, hydrogen with two electrons and a negative one formal charge is what's called a hydride. So, a hydride shift could occur to form a more stable carbocation. So, let's look at this carbocation here. We know that this carbon has the plus one formal charge. Here's one alkyl group, and here's a second alkyl group, so this is a secondary carbocation. And we can do a hydride shift. Before I show how to draw a hydride shift, let's go to the video so we can see it with the model set. So, here is that secondary carbocation. You can see the geometry around our sp2 hybridized carbon is planar. You can also see our empty p orbital here with the paddles, and we have two alkyl groups directly bonded to this carbon. On the right there's a methyl group, and on the left we have this big alkyl group. And in the back we have a hydrogen. So, notice that we are donating some electron density from this bond into our empty p orbital. We know that helps to stabilize our carbocation. But let me just take these paddles off here, and let's show a hydride shift. So remember, a hydride is a hydrogen and its two electrons, so I'm gonna take this hydrogen and these two electrons in this bond and I'm going to show a shift from this carbon to the carbon on the right. And that's a hydride shift. Now, on the left we took a bond away from this carbon, so that should be positively charged, and it should be planar or flat, but it's not because of the model set. I had to use a tetrahedral carbon here, so I'll show a new model set in a minute to show that it actually is planar. And, on the right, this should be tetrahedral. This carbon went from being sp2 hybridized to sp3. So, let me get out the new model set here, so we can better visualize what the carbocation actually looks like. So, this carbon, is our sp2 hybridized carbon now, and you can see it's planar around that carbon. And, this is a tertiary carbocation. We have a methyl group here, a methyl group here, and then an alkyl group over here. So, a tertiary carbocation is more stable than a secondary. You can also see at this carbon now we have an sp3 hybridized carbon here, so the geometry around that carbon is tetrahedral. It went from being planar to tetrahedral geometry. Let's draw the hydride shift that we saw in the video. So, attached to this carbon we know there is a hydrogen. And this hydrogen and these two electrons can move over to this carbon on the right to form a more stable carbocation. So, let's draw in that new carbocation. So, let me draw this in here. I'm gonna draw in that hydrogen in red, and let me go ahead and highlight it in red here like that, and notice we're taking a bond away from this carbon on the left. So, that's this carbon here. And that's a tertiary carbocation as we saw in the video, so we need to put a plus one formal charge on this carbon. Notice that there was a hydrogen on this carbon to start with, and it's still there in our tertiary carbocation. You can see it better in the video. But, the goal is to form a more stable carbocation in a rearrangement. And we go from a secondary carbocation on the left to a tertiary carbocation on the right, which we know is more stable. Finally, let's do one more kind of carbocation rearrangement. This one's called a methyl shift. So, this carbocation is secondary. The carbon with the plus one formal charge is directly bonded to a methyl group, and this alkyl group over here. So, for a methyl shift, we could take this methyl group here and we could show this methyl group moving from this carbon on the left to this carbon on the right. Let me go ahead and color code. So, I'm gonna say the carbon on the left I'm referring to as red, and the carbon on the right that I'm referring to is blue. So, the methyl group shifts from the carbon in red to the carbon in blue. And let's show the result of that methyl shift. So now, we would have a carbocation that looks like this. So, the carbon in red loses a bond. So, here's the carbon in red, it's sp3 hybridized, it's tetrahedral, but when it loses a bond, here's the carbon in red, now it's sp2 hybridized and has planar geometry with a plus one formal charge. The carbon in blue, let me circle that here, it was sp2 hybridized and planar, but it's gaining a methyl group, right? So, here's the methyl group that it's gaining, and this is the carbon in the blue, and it goes from being sp2 hybridized to now being sp3 hybridized. So remember, there was a hydrogen on this carbon in blue to begin with, and it's still there for our carbocation. So, this a tertiary carbocation, which we know is more stable than a secondary, so a methyl shift resulted in the more stable carbocation.",science_organic-chemistry_substitution-elimination-reactions

" In this video, we're going to look at the halogenation of benzene. And we'll start with bromination. So here's a benzene ring. And to this, we're going to add some bromine. And our catalyst will be aluminum bromide. And you could've used FeBr3 instead of AlBr3. That's fine. And the end result is substitution of a bromine atom for an aromatic proton on your ring. Let's look at the mechanism for this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. And if I look at the aluminum bromide catalyst, and I can see there are six electrons around the aluminum atoms. So here's two, and four, and then a total of six. And so because of aluminum's position on the periodic table, it can actually accept two more electrons. So the aluminum bromide is going to function as an electron pair acceptor, which is the definition for a Lewis acid. The bromine is going to function as a Lewis base. It's going to be an electron pair donor. So we could think about this lone pair of electrons in here being donated to the aluminum and a bond forming between that bromine and that aluminum. So let's go ahead and draw the result of that Lewis acid base reaction. And so now this bromine is bonded to this aluminum. This aluminum is still bonded to these other bromines here. I'm not going to draw in those lone pairs of electrons around those bromines just to save some time. Let's follow those electrons. So the electrons in magenta, those are the ones that were donated to the aluminum and forming of this bond between the bromine and the aluminum. That would give the aluminum a negative 1 formal charge. And this bromine would get a plus 1 formal charge, like that. Now technically, this is the complex that's going to react with our benzene ring in our mechanism. But it's kind of hard to see the electrophile in this complex. So let me just go ahead and show you what you can think about the electrophile being. And then we'll come back to this complex in the mechanism with benzene. So if these electrons in here moved off onto the bromine on the right, the bromine on the left will have lost a bond. So it would now only be surrounded by three lone pairs of electrons, giving it a plus 1 formal charge. And it simplifies things to think about this as being the electrophile in your mechanism for electrophilic aromatic substitution, even though, technically, it's going to be this top complex here that's going to react with our benzene ring. So if we form Br+ over here on the right, we would have this bromine now still bonded to this aluminum. And it would have three lone pairs of electrons around it now. So let me go ahead and highlight these electrons in here in red. I'm saying they're going to kick off onto that bromine there like that. And the aluminum, of course, is still bonded to these three other bromines. And it still has a negative 1 formal charge like that. So we've generated our electrophile. Or this is one way of simplifying it, to think about the Br+ as being our electrophile. And so that could react with our benzene ring. So we come back to our benzene ring here, and we think about Br+ as being the electrophile. And so, remember, electrophile means loving electrons. And so it is attracted to electrons. And of course, electrons are negatively charged. And they're attracted to positive things. So you could think about these pi electrons in your benzene ring as functioning as a nucleophile. And so we get a nucleophile attacking an electrophile here. And so let's go ahead and show the results of that nucleophilic attacks. So we have our ring. We have our pi electrons in our ring. And you can show the bromine adding to either one of these carbons. It doesn't really matter. Since they are equivalent, I'm going to show the bromine adding to the top carbon there. So the top carbon already has a hydrogen on it. And we're going to say that these electrons in here add on to the bromines. Let me go and highlight the electrons that we're talking about. So these Pi electrons in here function as a nucleophile, form a bond with that bromine like that. We took a bond away from this carbon down here. So we're actually going to get a plus 1 formal charge at that carbon. So we make a carbocation. Now remember, technically, it's actually this complex up here that's reacting with benzene. So we could think about it better mechanisms, or a more accurate mechanism, as being these electrons in magenta going up to here, attacking that bromine, and then the electrons in red here, once again, kicking off onto this bromine, forming this complex over here. And so that's the more accurate way of thinking about it. For me, it just simplifies things to think about Br+ as being an electrophile. So now that we've formed a carbocation here, we can actually draw some resot structures. And so if I took these pi electrons and moved them into here, let's go ahead and draw the resulting resot structure for that. So I would have my ring. I would have these pi electrons. I would have a hydrogen and a bromine still attached to my ring. And I would move does pi electrons over to here. So let me go ahead and highlight those. So these pi electrons moved over to here, took a bond away from this carbon this time. And so that's the one that's going to get a plus 1 formal charge like that. We could draw another resot structure. So these pi electrons up here could move down there. And let's go ahead and show the results of that. So once again, we have our ring. We have a hydrogen, a bromine, these pi electrons are still there, and we get some pi electrons moving over to here. So let me highlight those now. So these pi electrons right here move over to here. Took a bond away from this top carbon, and so that top carbon is going to get a plus 1 formal charge. And so we have three resot structures that we could draw for this carbocation. And remember, the actual ion is a hybrid of our three resot structures. And we could think about that hybrid as being a sigma complex. So in electrophilic aromatic substitution, the last step of the mechanism is deprotonation of your sigma complex to reform your aromatic ring. And so we could think about this complex right here. It's going to function as a base. And I'm going to say that these electrons in here could take this proton. And then it these electrons would move in to here to reform our aromatic ring. So let me go ahead and draw the product, which is bromobenzene. And since we have a lot of arrows going on there, let me go and highlight some electrons, so we can follow them. So let me go ahead and make these electrons in here blue. So these electrons are going to move in here to reform our aromatic ring. And these electrons in here, you could think about this complex as functioning as a base. And so those electrons pick up that proton. And so you'd form HBr as another product. So we'd have HBr here, and I'll highlight those electrons in green like that. And then, of course, we would also reform our catalyst. So AlBr3, our catalyst has been reformed in this reaction. And so that's the mechanism for the bromination of benzene. If you wanted to think about adding other halogen onto your benzene ring, let's go ahead and look at chlorination here. So if we started with a benzene ring, and we wanted to put a chlorine on our benzene ring, we would add some Cl2. And our catalyst would be, you could use AlCl3, aluminum chloride, or you could use FeCl3. It doesn't really matter which catalyst that you use here. The end result, of course, would be to substitute in a chlorine for one of the protons, one of the aromatic protons on your ring here. And so our product would be-- let me see if I can draw this in here. So we would have our benzene ring. And we would have a chlorine on our benzene ring to form a chlorobenzene. And if it helps you to think about HCl as being another product formed in this reaction, it is. And so these are just two mechanisms for the halogenation of benzene.",science_organic-chemistry_aromatic-compounds
" -  Someone walks up to you on the street and says, ""2943, quick is this divisible by nine? It's a matter of life and death"", and you could say, ""Well, I can do this fairly quickly"". To figure out whether it's divisible by nine, I just have to add up the digits and figure out if the sum of the digits is a multiple of nine or whether it's divisible by nine. So let's do that. Two plus nine plus four plus three, two plus nine is 11, 11 plus four is 15, 15 plus three is 18, and 18 is definitely divisible by nine, so this is going to be divisible by nine. And even if you are unsure of whether 18 is divisible by nine you could apply the same rule again. One plus eight is equal to nine, so that's definitely, definitely divisible by nine. And so the person can go save their lives or whoever's life they were trying to save with that information. But this might leave you thinking, well, that was nice and useful, but why did that work? Does this work for all numbers? Does it only work for nine? and I don't think this works for eight, or seven, or 11, or 17, why does it work for nine? And actually also works for three, and we'll think about that in the future video. And to realize that, we just have to rewrite 2943. So the two in 2943, it's in the thousands place, so we can literally rewrite it as two times, two times 1000, the nine is in the hundreds place, so we can literally write it as nine times 100, the four is in the tens place, so it's literally the same thing as four times 10, and then finally we have our three in the ones place, we could write it as three times one or just three. This is literally 2000, 900, 40, and three, 2943. But now we can rewrite each of these things, this thousand, this hundred, this ten, as a sum of one plus something that is divisible by nine, so 1000, 1000 I can rewrite as one plus 999, one plus 999, I can rewrite 100 as one plus 99, one plus 99, I can rewrite 10 as one plus 9, and so two times 1000 is the same thing as two times one plus 999, nine times 100 is the same thing as nine times one plus 99, four times 10 is the same thing as four times one plus nine, and then I have this plus three over here. But now I can distribute, I can say, well, this over here is the same thing as two times one, which is just two, plus two times 999, this thing right over here is the same thing as nine times one, just to be clear what I'm doing, I'm distributing the two over the first parenthesis, these first two terms, then the nine, I'm gonna distribute again, so it's gonna be nine, nine times one plus nine times 99, plus nine times 99, and then over here, I forgot the plus sign right over here, I'm gonna distribute the four, four times one, so plus four, and then four times nine, so plus four times nine, and then finally I have this positive three, or plus three right over here. Now I'm just gonna rearrange this addition, so I'm gonna take all the terms we're multiplying by 999, and I'm going to do that in orange. So I'm gonna take this term, this term, and this term right over here, and so I have two times 999, that's that there, plus nine times 99, plus four times nine, plus four times nine, so that's those three terms, and then I have plus two, plus two, plus nine, plus nine, plus four, plus four, and plus three, plus three. And this is interesting, this is just the sum of our digits, this is just what we did up here, and you might see where all of this is going, this orange stuff here, is this divisible by nine? What? Sure, it will definitely, 999, that's divisible by nine, so anything this is multiplying by, it's divisible by nine, so this is divisible by nine, this is definitely divisible by nine, 99, regardless of whether is being multiplied by nine, whatever is multiplying by nine, whatever is multiplying 99 is gonna be divisible by nine, because 99 is divisible by nine, so this works out, and same thing over here, you're always going to be multiplying by a multiple of nine, so all of this business all over here is definitely going to be divisible by nine. And so in order for the whole thing, and all I did is I rewrote 2943 like this right over here, in order for the whole thing to be divisible by nine, this part definitely is divisible by nine, in order for the whole thing does the rest of this sum, it has to be divisible by nine as well. So in order for this whole thing, all of this has to be divisible, divisible by nine.",math_pre-algebra_pre-algebra-factors-multiples
" -  So, Dementia is this general term we use when someone starts having trouble remembering, communicating, and understanding. And Alzheimer's Disease is a specific type of dementia that accounts for about 60 to 80% of all dementia cases. But what about the other 20 to 40%? Well, the second most common type, accounting for about 20 to 30% of dementia cases, is called Vascular Dementia. So, what do all the cells in your body, regardless of what they do, need to survive? Oxygen. They all need oxygen. Your brain cells are definitely no different. Actually, they are probably the biggest oxygen hogs in the body. Every time our heart beats, we pump about 20 to 25 % of that blood straight to our brain cells. So, if there are so many brain cells, or neurons, that need so much oxygen, you can imagine that the brain is especially vulnerable and sensitive to a lack in blood flow. So, when they don't get that oxygen. or get less of it, they can be damaged, or even start to die off. So, if, for example, your cells in your temporal lobe don't get enough oxygen and start to die off, it's going to be more difficult to remember things and form new memories because that's the area of your brain that controls those things. And so this is why we call it Vascular Dementia, where the Vascular part refers to the blood supply and the blood vessels supplying the brain. If there's any lack in blood flow to the brain as a result of a lowered blood supply, then loss of brain cells can follow and loss of certain mental functions. With Vascular Dementia, changes in thinking skills can happen suddenly following some sort of sudden damage, from a major stroke, maybe, which is an interruption in the blood supply to the brain. Also, though, changes in thinking skills can come about gradually due to minor strokes or a small vessel supplying the brain become blocked, leading to a more progressive damage. So, because it's related to your blood supply and your cardiovascular system, risk factors are very similar to the ones that could also raise your risk for heart diseases, blood vessel problems, and stroke. Some of these are things like smoking, high blood pressure, lack of exercise, obesity, and an unhealthy diet. Alright. So, that's the second most common type of dementia. The third most common type is called Dementia with Lewy Bodies and this accounts for about 10 to 25% of all dementia cases. And this type is caused by abnormal protein structures forming inside your neurons, called Lewy bodies, which are named after Dr. Friedrich Lewy, who discovered them in the early 1900s. Now, these Lewy bodies are actually accumulated bits of a protein called Alpha-synuclein. And you can find these guys hanging out in your brain cells, or your neurons. These Alpha-synuclein proteins are found widely throughout the brain, but their exact function isn't fully understood yet. One thing we do know is that when your cells can't properly process these proteins, they start to accumulate and sort of build up forming these Lewy bodies and, ultimately, end up damaging the cell. Symptoms of Lewy Body Dementia include problems with thinking and memory, movements and trembling, hallucinations, and even physically acting out dreams, like sleepwalking, talking or sleep kicking. Similarly to Alzheimer's, scientists have yet to figure out what the direct and specific cause for this build-up of Lewy Bodies is and research remains ongoing. On thing they do know, though, is that these Lewy Bodies can also be found in patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease, suggesting that there might be some similarities in how the brain has trouble breaking down these types of proteins. With that said, patients with Parkinson's Disease can develop dementia later on and if this happens, we call it Parkinson's Disease Dementia. And Parkinson's Disease alone usually affects your motor control, right? With this type of Dementia, the Parkinson's Disease has progressed to a point where it's started affecting mental functions in addition to your motor functions. Now, another type of Dementia is Frontotemporal Dementia, which used to be called Pick's Disease. And this type involves damage to the neurons that are specifically located in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. And when these neurons are damaged, things specific to those regions become affected, right? Like, spacial orientation in the frontal lobe or problems with speech from damage to the temporal lobe. Now, dementia, in general, can also be caused, or brought about, by other factors that result in some kind of accumulative damage to your brain. For example, the toxic effects of alcohol on brain cells through alcohol misuse can damage brain tissue, or repeated head injuries, like those sustained by professional boxers or football players, and we're talking about both American football and soccer, can seriously damage brain tissue over time. And it's also not uncommon for there to be more than one type of dementia present. For example, you could have Alzheimer's Disease, but also have Vascular Dementia as well.",science_health-and-medicine_mental-health
" In the previous videos we've talked about only the first ionization energy. In this video, we're going to compare the first and the second ionization energies, and we're going to use lithium as our example. So in the previous video, we already know that lithium has an atomic number of 3, so there are three protons in the nucleus. In a neutral atom of lithium, the number of electrons equals the number of protons, and so we know there are three electrons in lithium here. The electron configuration is 1s2 2s1. So we have two electrons in the 1s orbital so we can go ahead and put those two electrons in the 1s orbital like that. And then we have one more electron, and that electron's going to go into the 2s orbital like this. And so that would be a very simple picture of the neutral lithium atom. If we apply enough energy, we can actually pull away this outer electron here. So we can pull away that electron, and we call this the first ionization energy. And to pull away that electron takes approximately 520 kilojoules per mole. And so once we've pulled that electron away, we no longer have a neutral lithium atom, right? We would have a lithium ion because we would still have three positive charges in the nucleus, but we have only two negative charges now. We only have two electrons because we pulled one away. So 3 minus 2 gives us plus 1. So this is the lithium plus 1 cation. And the electron configuration would just be 1s2 because we lost the electron in the 2s orbital. And so we could keep going. We could apply some more energy and pull away another electron. So let's say that we pull away this electron this time. OK, so we're taking a second electron away, and so we wouldn't call this ionization energy 1. We would therefore call this ionization energy 2 because this is to take away the second electron. And this value turns out to be approximately 7,298 kilojoules per mole. And so if we take away that second electron, once again we still have three positive charges in the nucleus, but we have only one negative charge now. There's only one electron so this is no longer the lithium plus 1 cation. This is the lithium plus 2 cation because 3 minus 1 is plus 2. So this is lithium plus 2 here, and the electron configuration would be only one electron in a 1s orbital, so 1s1. So we can see that there is a big difference between the first ionization energy and the second ionization energy, so 520 versus 7,298. So let's see if we can explain the reasoning for this extremely large difference in ionization energies. And we're going to use the three factors that we've talked about in the previous videos. So the first factor we discussed was nuclear charge, which refers to the number of protons in the nucleus. So if we look at the neutral lithium atom, three positive charges in the nucleus. That positive charge is what's going to attract this electron in magenta here. And if we look at the lithium plus 1 cation, similar situation. We still have three protons in the nucleus, and so that positive charge is what's going to be attracting this electron as well. And so because of the same number of protons, we have to think more about effective nuclear charge, as opposed to how many protons there are in the nucleus. And before we do that, we have to consider the effect of electron shielding. So let's talk about electron shielding next. So electron shielding, also called electron screening, so electron shielding slash screening. So when we think about electron shielding, we're thinking about the inner orbital electrons here. So going back to the neutral lithium atom, these two inner shell electrons right here are going to repel this outer shell electron. So this one is going to repel this one as well. And so we can think about it as they screen the electron in magenta from feeling the full force of the positive 3 charge in the nucleus because electrons repel other electrons. And so the way to calculate the effect of nuclear charge-- so we've done this in the previous videos as well-- the simple way of calculating effective nuclear charge is take the number of protons, so plus 3, and from that you subtract the number of shielding electrons. So in this case, it would be these two electrons in the 1s orbital. So 3 minus 2 gives us an effective nuclear charge of plus 1. And so the electron in magenta isn't feeling a nuclear charge of plus 3. It's really only feeling an effective nuclear charge close to positive 1 because the actual value is approximately 1.3 when you do the more complicated calculations. And so the effect of electron shielding is to decrease the overall nuclear charge that this electron magenta feels. And so when we move over here to this electron, so I'm talking about this electron in magenta for the lithium plus 1 cation, it's not the same situation, right? There's not much electron shielding. This electron over here might repel it a little bit, but there are no inner shell electrons repelling this electron in magenta. And because of that, the electron in magenta is going to feel this positive 3 charge, much more of the full positive 3 charge of the nucleus. And so therefore, there's going to be a much greater attractive force holding this electron in magenta to this nucleus. And therefore, you have to apply more energy to pull that electron away. So the effect of electron shielding tells you the second electron is much harder to remove than the first, and so we see a large increase in ionization energy from the first ionization energy to the second ionization energy. The last factor that we discussed was distance, so the distance of those electrons in magenta from the nucleus. So on the left, once again going back to the neutral lithium atom, this electron is in the second energy level. So it's further away than this electron. This electron is in the first energy level, in the 1s2, so this distance here is smaller than the distance on the left. And so since the distance is smaller, this electron in magenta feels more of an attractive force from the nucleus. Once again, that's Coulomb's law. And so therefore, there's an increased attractive force. Therefore, you take more energy to pull that electron away. So it takes much more energy to pull the second electron away than the first, and so that's why we see an increase in ionization energy. So distance says the fact that this electron is closer means it takes more energy to pull it away, and that's another reason why this number for the second ionization energy is so much larger than the first. So it takes a heck of lot more energy to pull away your second electron. And that explains why we see lithium forming a plus 1 cation, because it doesn't take anywhere near as much energy to pull away one electron as it does to take away two to form a lithium 2 plus. And so this is one way to tell what kind of an ion will form. Look at the ionization energies, and when you see a huge jump, that clues you in as to which ions are easier to form.",science_ap-chemistry_periodic-table-ap
" -  Represent the following data using a box-and-whiskers plot. Exclude the median when computing the quartiles. Alright, let's see if we can do this. So, we have a bunch of data, here, and they say if it helps, you might drag the numbers to put them in a different order. So, we can drag these numbers around, which is useful, because we will want to order them. The order isn't checked with your answer, and I'm doing this off of the Khan Academy exercises, so I don't have my drawing tablet here. I just have my mouse, and I'm interacting with the exercise, which I encourage you to do too, because the best way to learn any of this stuff is to actually practice it, and at Khan Academy, we have 150,000 exercises for you to practice with. Anyway, so, let's do this. Let's order this thing, so we can figure out the range of numbers. What's the lowest and what's the highest? Let's see, there's a seven here. Then, let's see, we have some eights. We've got some eights goin' on. Then we have some nines, actually we have a bunch of nines, we have four nines here. We have some nines, and then, let's see, 13 is the largest number. There we go, we've ordered the numbers. So, our smallest number is seven, and this is what the whiskers are useful for. For helping us figure out the entire range of numbers. Our smallest number is seven. Our largest number is 13, so we know the range. Now, let's plot the median, and this'll help us once getting this center line of our box, but then also we need to do that, to figure out what these other lines are, that kind of define the box. To define the middle two fourths of our number. Of our data, or the middle two quartiles. Roughly the middle two quartiles, it depends how some of the numbers work out. But this middle line is going to be the median of our entire data set. Now, the median is just the middle number. If we sort them in order, median is just the middle number. We have 11 numbers here. So, the middle one is gonna have five on either side. It's just gonna be this nine. If we had 10 numbers here, if we had an even number of numbers, you actually would of had two middle numbers, and then to find the median, you'd found the mean of those two. If that last sentence was confusing, watch the videos on Khan Academy, on median, and I go into much more detail on that. But here, I have 11 numbers, so my median is going to be the middle one. It has five larger, five less, it's this nine, right over here. If I had my pen tablet, I would circle it. So, it's this nine. That is the median. Now, we need to figure out what number is half way, what number is the median of the numbers in this bottom half? They told us to exclude the median when we compute the quartiles. So, this was the median. Let's ignore that. So, let's look at all of the numbers below that. So, this nine, eight, eight, eight, and seven. So, we have five numbers. What's the median of these five numbers? Well the median's the middle number. That is eight. So, the beginning of our second quartile is gonna be an eight, right over there. We do the same thing for our third quartile. Remember, this was our median of our entire data set. Let's exclude it. Let's look at the top half of the numbers, so to speak. There's five numbers here, in order. So, the middle one, the median of this is 10. So, that's gonna be the top of our second quartile. Just like that, we're done. We have constructed our box-and-whisker plot.",math_statistics-probability_summarizing-quantitative-data
" -  Diabetes, it's certainly not a problem that's unique to pregcy, but it's something we always have to discuss when we're talking about pregcy because it can really complicate that picture quite a bit. So firstly, diabetes and pregcy split up into two different categories. There's the category of women who had diabetes before becoming pregt, and that's called pre-gestational diabetes. So that category is referred to as pre-gestational diabetes. Pre for before, gestational for pregcy, so before pregcy diabetes. And then there are the women who become diabetic during their pregcy, which is called gestational diabetes. So that's the second category, gestational diabetes. And 90% of cases, so that's nine of every 10 cases of diabetes in pregcy falls into this category of gestational diabetes. And then the other 10% are pre-gestational diabetics. So there's something about pregcy that makes women more susceptible to developing diabetes and we'll discuss exactly what that is in just a bit. But firstly, why do we even split up diabetes into these two different groups? Well, if a woman has pre-gestational diabetes, that means that her blood sugars may have been poorly controlled at the time that the baby was conceived. Or even during the first eight weeks of the pregcy, during a period called organogenesis. So the first eight weeks of pregcy is a period called organogenesis, when the fetus' organs are made. And those high levels of glucose during that really pivotal time can lead to a miscarriage or it can lead to significant anomalies within the fetus. However, with gestational diabetes, that problem with glucose control develops during the pregcy, in some ways because of the pregcy. And usually the glucose control isn't impaired until the second trimester, so after the point of conception and after the point of organogenesis. So miscarriage and fetal anomalies don't tend to be a problem with gestational diabetes. But that's not to say that gestational diabetes doesn't harm the fetus. Rather, diabetes as a whole, so regardless of the category, can cause preterm labor. It can cause problems with the growth of the fetus. It can even lead to stillbirth. And one of the complications that we tend to think about a lot, that tends to be talked about a lot, is fetal macrosomia. So fetal macrosomia. So let me explain that a little bit. Alright, so if mom has diabetes, the basic gist of it all is that her glucose levels tend to run on the high side. And glucose can cross the placenta, into the bloodstream of the fetus. That's like one of the main purposes of the placenta, to allow glucose to enter the baby's bloodstream as an energy supply. So then when mom has high glucose levels in her blood, then the fetus has high glucose levels in its blood. And that drives the release of insulin in the fetus, because that's the body's primary response to glucose, to release insulin. Insulin is kind of the key that allows cells to open up their doors and take up glucose and use it. And so that insulin that's released in the fetus allows glucose to be taken up. And insulin does a few other things. It also stimulates fat storage in the body, right? And it also binds to receptors on different organs, such as the heart and the liver, and it causes them to grow. It causes the organs to actually grow in size. And so the end result of it all, the end result of the high glucose levels in the mom, leading to high glucose levels in the baby, leading to high insulin levels in the baby, is that the baby grows to a larger size than normal, which is called fetal macrosomia. Macro for large and soma for body. So larger body. Now another thing that I want to mention is that in pre-gestational diabetes, so again, diabetes before the point of pregcy, the impaired glucose control is more long-standing. So these women are more likely to have diabetic complications such as kidney damage or vascular problems, so blood vessel related problems, and damage to the retina. And pregcy can aggravate these complications, so it can it make worse. So it's really important to monitor these conditions throughout the pregcy. Now, I want to stop dancing around the issue of why women can become diabetic during pregcy. A lot of it has to do with the hormones that are released during pregcy. So hormones such as HPL, that's not one that many people have heard of, right? It stand for human placental, human placental lactogen. Alright, so that's HPL. Another hormone is cortisol. So the body's main stress hormone. Another one that you may have heard of before is growth hormone, that's released in a large quantity during pregcy. And then finally, progesterone. Progesterone, which is exceptionally important for the maintece of a healthy pregcy. So these hormones are released during pregcy and they have lots of important roles. And among their many, many roles, these hormones increase mom's production of glucose during pregcy to make sure that the fetus has enough of the glucose, enough of its primary fuel source. And that leads to high glucose levels within the mom's blood. And you might be thinking, ""Well, that's no problem, ""because the glucose will cause insulin to be released ""and that insulin will cause mom's cells ""to take up the glucose and problem solved. ""You don't have high glucose levels in the blood any more."" Well, unfortunately, it doesn't really work that way, because these same hormones make the mom's body resistant to insulin. So that the cells don't respond to insulin and don't take up as much glucose from the blood. And this is done for a purpose. It's actually done so that you can reduce mom's utilization of the glucose so that more of the glucose is available for the fetus. And that's why you can end up with high blood glucose levels and diabetes in pregcy. Or if you had diabetes before you became pregt, it can become worse during pregcy. So, given that diabetes can cause all of these complications for mom and baby during pregcy, it goes without saying that we do our absolute best to screen for it during pregcy. So for women who have a normal risk of having diabetes, we do a routine screen. So for all women, all average women, we do a routine screen around 26 to 28 weeks into the pregcy. And that screening test is usually in the form of a glucose tolerance test. So the screening test is often called the glucose tolerance test, where the woman is given a very specific amount of glucose and her blood glucose levels are measured at one, two, or three hours after consuming that very specific amount of glucose. And if her blood glucose levels are above the normal range, then she's found to be diabetic. And if a woman is diagnosed with diabetes during her pregcy, we do our best to control it with diet. And if that doesn't work, then insulin is kind of our second line of treatment. And it's also important to know that gestational diabetes, so again, diabetes that occurs during pregcy, kind of as a process of pregcy, increases the risk of a woman having overt diabetes after the pregcy is over. So it's really important to follow up with all these women after they deliver. Kind of the set point, six weeks after they deliver to test them for diabetes. Okay, so that is gestational diabetes in a nut shell.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" Let's do a survey about how we would measure the volume of fluids under US customary units. So the smallest volume of fluid that you'll hear people talk about-- and this will often be in cooking recipes or something like this-- you'll talk about a teaspoon. And most of us have teaspoons that are roughly the size of a teaspoon in our cupboards someplace. So this recipe might call for a teaspoon of sugar, or a teaspoon of salt, or a teaspoon of oil. And you've seen what it looks like. But those are the smaller spoons that you might have in your cabinets in your kitchen at home. So this might be a teaspoon right over here. Now, if you were to take 3 teaspoons together, you have something else that you would probably have in your cabinets. So if we multiply this volume, so let's say this right over here is a teaspoon. This right over here is a teaspoon of some substance. If you multiply that by 3, then you get to the tablespoon. So 3 teaspoons equal 1 tablespoon. So a tablespoon's going to be a little bit bigger. So a tablespoon might look like this. These tend to be about the size of the larger spoons that you have in your cupboard, so a tablespoon, just like that. So if you have 3 times the fluid, you get to a tablespoon. Now, if you take 2 tablespoons, put them together, then you get to the ounce. And I have to be careful here. You get to the fluid ounce. And the US customary units, they aren't designed to be super, super clear. Because you also have the ounce as a measure of weight. You have the ounce that is a measure of weight, which is equal to 1/16 of a pound. And now you have a fluid ounce, which you could either view as 2 tablespoons or, as we'll see, 1/8 of a cup. Now, you might say, well, why are they both called ounces? What's the relationship between the two? Well, there is somewhat of a relationship between the two. If you took a little bit over an ounce of water, so a weight of ounce of water, slightly over an ounce of water, that volume is going to be about a fluid ounce. An ounce of water in weight and a fluid ounce of water in volume are very, very, very close, although they aren't exactly the same thing. Now, if you think about, what would you measure here? We already talked about recipes, and teaspoon, tablespoon, fluid ounce. You might be thinking about how much medicine maybe someone might take. Maybe they need to take 2 tablespoons, which would be equivalent to a fluid ounce. Now, if you take 8 fluid ounces and put them together-- so let me draw a fluid ounce here just so we still have drawings. So you could imagine some medicines have a little cap on the top that you could put the medicine in. So if you do 2 tablespoons in it, maybe that will be a fluid ounce. Now, if you take 8 fluid ounces then you get to a cup. And many of us have this in our kitchens. We have a measuring cup that will measure exactly a cup. And you might have a recipe for pancakes that say, hey, put a cup of flour in there. And also a lot of the cups that you have in your house might be around might be around the size of a cup. If you look at, say, a can of soda that you're probably familiar with, a can of soda, the typical can of soda, is 12 ounces, not 8 ounces. So a typical can of soda is a cup and a half. We see that a cup is 8 fluid ounces. A typical can of soda is 12 fluid ounces. So it is equivalent to a cup and a half. Let me make sure this looks like a can of some kind. So if this was 12 ounces, this is 1 and 1/2 cups. But it gets you a sense of how much fluid volume a cup actually is. Now, if we were to take 2 cups, now you're dealing with a pint. And so you might have seen pints. Sometimes they're in these small cartons. So a pint might look something like this in a carton. That looks more like a house. But I think, hopefully, you get the picture that this is intended to be a carton of some kind. So you have something like that. And so the pint, it's 2 cups. And so let's say this is the fluid inside of it. Let's say this was transparent, and you might see it there. Or if you have a very large mug, that might be the size of a pint, so if you have a very large mug like this. So my best attempt at drawing a large mug, this might be roughly equal to a pint. So let me put some fluid in here. So there you go. There's my large mug. It's got a pint. Now, if you take 2 pints, now you are dealing with a quart. And you might have found yourself going to your local convenience store and buying a quart of milk. A quart of milk, those are kind of those longer but still kind of skinny looking-- so it might look something like this. I'm trying to draw a carton of a quart of milk. And then finally, if you were to take 4 quarts together, you get to a gallon. So you take 4 quarts together-- so times 4-- you get to a gallon. So we're most familiar with a gallon of milk. So let me see if I can draw a gallon of milk here, my best attempt. Well, I'm sure someone could draw a better gallon of milk here. But at least in the US, it tends to be one of the most typical ways that they sell milk. And it has, oftentimes, a little red or orange thing right on top there, so a gallon of milk. So just to review things, right here, I just multiplied from the smaller unit to the larger one. But if you want to think about everything in terms of ounces, that's one way to think about it. A cup right over here is equal to 8 ounces. 8 ounces is equal to a cup. If you multiply that by 2, then you get to 16 ounces is equal to a pint. If you multiply that by 2, you get 32 ounces. 32 ounces is equal to a quart. And if you multiply that times 4, you get 30 times 4 is 120, plus 8. You get 128 ounces per gallon. And so next time you go buy something in the supermarket, I encourage you to look at how it's being measured. And you'll see that oftentimes you might buy a quart of milk, but they'll also say that this is a 32-ounce container. And in this context, they're talking about fluid ounces.",math_4th-engage-ny_engage-4th-module-7
" OK, so in this video we're going to connect spiders' LED eyes. Now you'll notice the LEDs have four legs. One of the legs is longer, or one of the leads is longer. So we want to bend the longer lead back. Now on the first one that we're going to put up, we're going to bend the longer lead back in such a way that we have one of the legs-- it's going to connect to pin 12. And so we want to sort of bend those legs out so that we can connect to pin 12. And then we're also going to connect next to the exposed pins, which are going to be pin seven and eight So we want to bend those legs out, and you can use the nipper pliers to trim them down just a little bit. So it'll go pin 12, pin 7, pin 8, and the long leg is bent backwards. OK, so we're going to do the same thing for this LED. And we're going to bend that long leg backwards. There we go. And then we're going to connect our legs. So the legs are going to go-- in this one, they're going to go into, looks like-- I think we're going to do pin four, three, and two. So those are digital pins four, three, and two. And it takes a little bit of doing to get in there, but we got it. OK. So those are going to be our eyes. So, I think that's right. Yeah. Line it up there. OK. All right. So once we've got the LED in place for those, we can take our resistors, and we can connect those resistors to our LEDs. Now the legs that we bent back are the negatives. They're the ones that connect to the negative part of the circuit. And so we're going to trim those down, and we're going to trim down our resistor leads just a little bit so it doesn't take up quite so much space. And then we're going to solder them together. And so when you take resistor, you want to-- I tried to twist the two around each other, and they're just too short to do that in an easy way. So what I ended up doing was-- and I was thinking maybe I could take a piece of wire and twist it, and it didn't work. So what I end up doing was grabbing a alligator clip and use the alligator clip to hold them together while-- there it goes again, it's falling. All right. Now here we go, finally got the alligator clip in place. And sit still-- there we go. Oh, it's falling again. So this can be kind of trying, but once you get the alligator clip, it should work for you. OK, so the alligator clip does two things. It holds the resistor in place, but it also allows us to absorb some heat so that we don't damage our LED. So now I'm just trimming off some of the excess there. And I will do the same for the other side of the resistor and the LED. So we'll do the same on the other eye. And now we're just trimming some heat shrink tubing and we're going to slide the heat shrink tubing up over our resistor. And that way we can protect the exposed wires from potentially shorting on another piece of metal. It's always good to make sure that those exposed wires are covered. Now, you can always take just some electrical tape and cover over it too. OK, so we've got our heat shrink tubing. We'll slide that up over the connection. And again, electrical tape works just as well. It's not quite as neat as the heat shrink, but it works just as well. OK, so now what we're going to do is, we are connecting the-- sliding the other piece of heat shrink tubing up. And then we're going to twist the two pieces together. And we'll twist those together with the wire that is coming from the negative side of our motor controller, or the negative output of the motor controller. So it's kind of tricky to get these to go together. And you can see that I actually broke the lead on the LED because I moved it around too much. So the way to fix that is to just take the resistor and-- there's already some solder on the resistor and I can hold it against the LED there and get it to hold in place. And so, that'll work. So hopefully that won't happen to you. OK, so anyway, we got the leads on the LED and we're going to twist everything together. There we go. All right, so now once those pieces are twisted together, we can solder them and make sure that joint stays solid. OK, so, we're just going to take the solder, heat it up, and make sure that it flows over the wires there. And then again, we'll trim off the rough edges and-- I realized after doing this that the heat shrink tubing then I put on the black wires is actually too small to slide over the solder that I put on. So I can't really use it to do what I wanted it to do. I wanted it to slide up over the solder. So if you do this, use a larger diameter heat shrink tubing if you're going to use that, so it can slide over that solder joint. But this actually serves as a good proof point for-- we're just using the heat gun here to shrink up the tubing. So to cover up those open leads. And then we're going to take a piece of electrical tape. And like I was saying, this kind of works as a good proof point for how the electrical tape can also cover over some exposed wire. And we'll just trim off the excess there and make sure that it's connected pretty tightly. OK, so now our LEDs are connected. And the wires are insulated, and they're in the right sockets, and everything's in the right place. Now you, again, probably want to spend some time bending the wires to get everything just right. So now we're just sliding our bottle cap eyes on. Now you want to kind of careful doing this, because you have to push the LEDs apart to get the bottle caps to go on just right. But once you got them on, you want to double check that the leads are still connected in the right pins and that nothing got pulled out. And there we go. OK, so we can see that the board is on. We're about to program it.",science_electrical-engineering_robots
" Based on the examples in the last video, let's see if we can come up with some rules of thumb for figuring out how many significant figures or how many significant digits there are in a number or a measurement. So the first thing that is pretty obvious is that any non-zero digit and any of the zero digits in between are significant. Clearly, the 7 and the 5 here are significant. And the 0 in between them, it's also going to be significant. So let's write this over here. So any non-zero digits and zeros in between are going to be significant. That's pretty straightforward. Now, the zeros that are not in between nonzero digits, these become a little bit more confusing. So let's just make sure we can rule out some of them. So you can always rule out when you're thinking about significant figures, the leading 0's. And when I'm talking about leading zeros, I'm talking about the zeros that come before your non-zero digit. So these are leading zeroes here. These are leading zeroes. There is no leading zeroes here. No leading zeroes in this one, this one, and this one. But in any situation, the leading zeros are not significant. So leading zeros not significant, I'll write it over here. Leading zeros not significant. And so the last question, all you have left, I mean you only have non-zero digits and zeros in between. You could have some leading zeros, which you've already said are not significant. And so the only thing left that you have to figure out is what do you do with the trailing zeroes, the zeroes behind the last non-zero, or to the right of the last non-zero digit. So these trailing zeroes here. There's actually two trailing zeroes over here. And then there's three trailing zeroes over here. So let me make a little-- so trailing zeroes. Trailing zeroes, what do we do with them? So the easy way to think about is if you have a decimal, if there's a decimal anywhere in your number, count them. If you have a decimal, count them. Count them as significant. They are significant, count them as significant. If there's no decimal anywhere in the number, then it's kind of ambiguous. You're kind of not sure and this is a situation. So clearly over here, there's a decimal in the number, so you count the trailing zeroes. These are adding to the precision. Over here there's a decimal, so you count the trailing zero. There's a decimal here, so you count the trailing zeroes. There are no trailing zeroes here. And over here-- well, the way I later put a decimal here. Here you would count it. So if you have the decimal there, you would count all five. If you didn't have the decimal, if you just had 37,000 like that, it's ambiguous. And if someone doesn't give you more information, your best assumption is probably that they just measured to the nearest thousand. That they didn't measure exactly the one and just happened to get exactly on 37,000. So if there's no decimal, let me write it this way-- it's ambiguous, which means that you're not sure what it means, it's not clear what it means. And you're probably safer assuming to not count it. If someone really does measure, if you were to really measure something to the exact one, then you should put a decimal at the end like that. And there is a notation for specifying. Let's say you do measure-- and let me do a different number. Let's say you do measure 56,000. And there is a notation for specifying that 6 definitely is the last significant digit. And sometimes you'll see a bar put over the 6, sometimes you'll see a bar put under the 6. And that could be useful because maybe your last significant digit is this zero over here. Maybe you were able to measure to the hundreds with a reasonable level of precision. And so then you would write something like 56,000, but then you would put the bar above that zero, or the bar below that zero to say that that was the last significant digit. So if you saw something like this, you would say three significant digits. This isn't used so frequently. A better way to show that you've measured to three significant digits would be to write it in scientific notation. There's a whole video on that. But to write this in scientific notation, you could write this as 5.60 times 10 to the fourth power. Because if you multiply this times to the fourth, you would move this decimal over four spaces and get us to 56,000. So 5.60 times 10 to the fourth. And if this confuses you, watch the video on scientific notation. It will hopefully clarify things a little bit. But when you write a number in scientific notation, it makes it very clear about your precision and how many significant digits you're dealing with. So instead of doing this notation that's a little bit outdated-- I haven't seen it used much with these bars below or above the high significant digit, instead you could represent it with a decimal in scientific notation. And there it's very clear that you have three significant digits. So hopefully that helps you out. In the next couple of videos, we'll explore a little bit more why significant digits are important, especially when you do calculations with multiple measurements.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-11th-physics-units-and-measurement
" - Hey Check this out ah cool huh? I bet you wish you could do this, have a clone clean up around the upon for you, go to class maybe take your mom out to dinner on her birthday, well you can't do that and actually there are some really good reasons why you can't do that. We're going to talk about those in the next episode. But you know what can clone themselves, your cells like almost every single one of them and in fact they're doing it right now. For any creature bigger than a single-celled organism, all of life stems from cells ability to reproduce themselves because that's what allows organisms to develop and grow and heal and keep from dying for as long as possible. This particular kind of cell division is called mitosis and it's responsible for a whole lot of your body's key functions. If you get a cut your buttons to make new cells, mitosis. Have too much to drink, damage your liver you got to replace those cells, mitosis. Tumor growing in your spine unfortunately again, mitosis. While you go from a 7-pound baby to a 70-pound child, it's not your cells that are increasing in mass you're just getting more of them, over and over and over again that's mitosis. This process is so central to your life that it will take place, in your body over your lifetime about 10 quadrillion times! that's 10,000 billion times! Like all split ups it's not easy, it's gonna maybe be a little bit messy, there's a lot of drama and it can take a surprisingly long amount of time but trust me after we're done with it, we'll all be better off. (happy music) So you are made of trillions of cells just like giraffes and redwood trees and remember that inside each cell, there's a nucleus that stores your DNA which contains all of the instructions on how to build you. That DNA is organized into chromosomes and as we've mentioned before and your body cells or somatic cells you have 46 chromosomes, grouped into 23 pairs. One in each pair's from your mum and the other ones from your dad. Cells with all 46 chromosomes are called diploid cells because they have two sets each and that's what we're focusing on today. You also have haploid cells that have half as many chromosomes 23 and those are your sex cells, they're produced in an equally fantastic process called meiosis, which we'll be talking about in the next episode. But for now the main thing to remember about mitosis that allows one cell with 46 chromosomes to split into two cells that are genetically identical each with 46 chromosomes, all in order to keep the party of life going. Now the nucleus in your cell controls everything that goes on in the cell. It has all the instructions necessary for making the cell survive so you don't need to duplicate the whole cell, all you need to do is duplicate the DNA, get it wrapped up and then if you have two separate pockets of DNA that's all you need to have two new cells. Mitosis takes place in a series of discrete stages, called prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase and you could just say that over and over again and let it sink into your head. And part of what's you know really amazing about this whole process, is that while we know what these stages are, we don't always know the underlying mechanisms that make all of them happen and this is part of science. Science isn't like all the stuff we know, it's how we're trying to figure all this stuff out. Consider a job security, if you ever want to be a biologist there is a lot of stuff that future biologists have to still figure out and this is one of them. All right let's get our clone on. So most of their lives, cells hang out in this limbo period called interphase which means they're in between episodes of mitosis. Mostly growing and working and doing all the stuff that makes them useful to us. During interphase the long strings of DNA are loosely coiled and messy like that dust bunny of dog fur and laundry lint under your bed. That mess of DNA is called chromatin but as the mitosis process begins to gear up lots of things start happening in the cell to get ready for the big division. One of the more important things that happens, is that this little set of protein cylinders next to the nucleus called the centrosome, duplicates itself. We're gonna have to move a lot of stuff around in the nucleus and that's going to be regulated by these centrosomes. The other thing that happens is that all of the DNA begins to replicate itself too giving the cell two copies, of every strand of DNA. To brush up on how DNA replicates itself like this, check out this episode and then come on back. Now the cell enters the first phase or the prophase when that mess of chromatin condenses and coils up on itself to produce thick strands of DNA are wrapped around proteins. Those my friends are your chromosomes. Instead of dust bunnies the DNA starting to look a little bit more like dreadlocks and the duplicates that have been made, don't just float around freely they stay attached to the original and together they look like little X's. These are called the chromatids and one copy, is the left leg and arm of the X and the other copy, is the right leg and arm. Where they meet in the middle is called the centromere. Just so you know these X's are also called chromosomes sometimes double chromosomes or double stranded chromosomes and when the chromatids separate, they're considered individual chromosomes too. Now while the chromosomes are forming, the nuclear envelope gets out of the way by like completely disintegrating. And the centrosomes then peel away from the nucleus, start heading to opposite ends of the cell. As they go they leave behind a wide trail of protein ropes, called microtubules running from one centrosome to the other. You might recall from our anatomy of the animal cell, that microtubules help provide a kind of structure to the cell. This is exactly what they're doing here. Now we reach the metaphase which literally means after phase and it's the longest phase of mitosis it can take up to 20 minutes. During the metaphase the chromosomes attach to those roping microtubules, right in the middle at their centromeres. The chromosomes then begin to be moved around and this seems to be being done by molecules called motor proteins and while we don't know too much about how these motors work we do know for instance, that there are two of them on each side of the centromere. These are called centromere associated protein e. So these motor proteins attached to the microtubule ropes, basically serve to spool up the tubules slack. At the same time another protein called dynein, is pulling up the slack from other ends of the ropes near the cell membranes. After being pulled in this direction and that, the chromosomes line up right down the middle of the cell. And that brings us to the latest installment of Biolo-graphy. (happy music) So how do chromosomes line up like that we know that there are motor proteins involved but like how? What are they doing? Well remember when I said earlier that there were a lot of things that we don't totally understand about mitosis, it's sort of weird that we don't because we can literally watch mitosis happening, under microscopes but chromosome alignment is a good example of a small detail that has only very recently been figured out. And it was a revelation like a 130 years in the making. Mitosis was first observed by a German biologist by the name of Walter Fleming. Who in 1878 was studying the tissue of salamander gills and fins when he saw cells nuclei split in two and migrate away from each other to form two new cells. He called this process mitosis. After the Greek word for thread because of the messy jumble of chromatin, a term he also coined that he saw on the nuclei. But Fleming didn't pick up on the implications of this discovery for genetics which was still a young discipline. And over the next century generations of scientists started piecing together the mitosis puzzle by determining the role of microtubules say or identifying motor proteins. Now the most recent contribution to this research was made by a postdoctoral student named Tomomi Kiyomitsu at MIT. He watched the same process that Fleming watched and figured out how at least one of the motor proteins help snap the chromosomes into line. He was studying a motor protein called dynein which sits on the inside of the membrane. Think of the microtubules as tug-of-war ropes with the chromosomes as the flag in the middle. What Kiyomitsu discovered, was that the dynein plays tug of war with itself. Dyenin grabs on to one end of the microtubules and pulls the tubules and chromosomes toward one end of the cell. When the ends of the microtubules come too close to the cell membrane they release a chemical signal that punched the dynein to the other side of the cell. There it grabs onto the other end of the microtubules and starts pulling until smack, it gets punted back again. All of this ensures that the chromosomes will line up exactly in the middle, so that they will be split evenly. That discovery was published in February of 2012, a couple of weeks before I sat down in this chair and 134 years after mitosis was first observed. If you want to join the ranks of scientists who are answering the many questions left about mitosis and lots of other things about our lives, maybe someday I'll do a Biolo-graphy about you. Now so far we've gone through the interface where the centrosomes in DNA replicate themselves, get ready for the split. The prophase where the chromosomes form and the centrosomes start to spread apart in the metaphase, where the chromosomes align in the middle of the cell. And now it's time to separate the chromosomes, from their copies. This time motor proteins start pulling so hard on the ropes that the X shaped chromosomes split back, into their individual single chromosomes. Once they're detached from each other, they're dragged toward either end of the cell. Since the prefix Ana means back that may help you remember the name of this phase, called anaphase. After this it's just a matter of using all that genetic material to rebuild, so that the copied genetic material has all of the accoutrements of home. In the last phase telophase, each of the new cells structures are reconstructed first the nuclear membrane reforms, the nucleoli form within them and the chromosomes relax back into chromatin and a little crease forms between the two new cells which marks the beginning of the final split. That division between the two new cells, is called cleavage and all that's left is to make a clean break. This is done by cytokinesis literally cell movement by which the two new nuclei, move apart from each other and the cells separate. We now have two new cells each with a full set of 46 chromosomes. These clones are called the daughter cells of the original cell and like identical twins they are genetic copies of each other and also of their parents. But of course that's obviously not the case for you, 1even if you are an identical twin, 1shout out identical twins, 1see me in the comments while you kind of are a clone 1of your sibling, 1you are not a clone of your parents. 1Instead half DNA and each of your cells is from your mom 1and half is from your dad. To understand why 1that is we have to understand how eggs and sperm are formed 1and that is meiosis.And that's what we're gonna 1be talking about next week on crash course.",science_biology_crash-course-bio-ecology
" The percent of adults who smoke recorded every few years since 1967 suggests a negative linear association with no outliers. On average, the percent drops by 0.5 points each year. Which of the following plots suits the above description? So let's see, this looks like a negative linear association. As the years go by, you have a smaller percentage of smokers. This one does too. As years go by, you have the number of smokers go down and down. This one down here also looks like that, although it's not as smooth. If you were to fit a line here, it looks like you have a few outliers. Well, this is a positive correlation. So we can definitely rule out Graph 4. Now, the other thing that they told us is that there are no outliers, suggests a negative linear association with no outliers. If you were to try to fit a line to Graph 3, you could fit a line pretty reasonably. That would go someplace like that. But it would have this outlier right over here. It looks like it's 12 or 13 years after 1967. So that would be 1980. It looks like an outlier there. But they said it didn't have any outliers. So we would rule out Graph 3. And so we have to pick between Graph 1 and Graph 2. So the other hint they give us or piece of data they give us is that the percent drops by 0.5% each year. So here's what's happening. In 1967, it looks like we're at about 55%. And then 10 years go by. We are roughly at around 45, a little under 45%. So we dropped 10% in 10 years. That seems to be how much this is dropping, roughly 10% in 10 years. Another 10 years go by. We go from 45, a little more than 10% in 10 years. And so that would mean that we're dropping, on average, more than one percentage point per year. That seems more than what's going on here. Now, let's look over here. Over here, we're starting, it looks like, at around 42%. And then after 10 years, it looks like we're at 37%. So it looks like we've dropped about 5% in 10 years, which is consistent with this. If you drop 5% in 10 years, that means you drop half a percent per year. So we'll go with Graph 2.",math_statistics-probability_describing-relationships-quantitative-data
" What is the nth number in the following sequence? Let's see. The first term here is a 6. So over here I'll put the term. So this is the number. I'll just write num there. That's the number. And this is the term. So the first term here is a 6. It looks like we add 3 to that to get to a 9. Or maybe there's some other pattern here. So that's the second term, is 9. Then they go from 9 to 12. Looks like we add 3 again. So we keep adding 3. So the third term is 12, the fourth term is 15. And we need to think of a general expression that will give us the value of the nth term. The nth number in the following sequence. So let's think a little bit about it. We know that we're incrementing by 3 every time and we're starting at 6. So let's write these in terms of multiples of 3, since we know that that's the increment level. This first term right here is 3 times 2. The second term right here is 3 times 3. This third term is 3 times 4. And so it looks like it's 3 times one more than the actual term you are dealing with. Right? Here, if you take your term, you add 1 and then multiply that by 3, you get 6. Take your term, add 1, then multiply it by 3. Take your term, add 1, you get 4. Then multiply by 3. Take your term, add 1-- which would be 5-- and then multiply by 3, you get 15. So it looks like any time-- so if you have your nth term. So if you go all the way out here to your nth term, the value here would be you'd add 1 to it. So you'd have n plus 1, and then you'd multiply that by 3. So the nth term is 3 times n plus 1. Or if you wanted to distribute out the 3, it'd be 3n plus 3. And just make sure that works for all of them. The first term, 3 times 1 is 3 plus 3, that works. That's 6. The second term, 3 times 2 plus 3 is 9. So it works for all of these terms. So that is the nth term. We have to assume that this pattern continues.",math_algebra-home_alg-series-and-induction
" SALMAN KHAN: This is Sal again. I'm here at Stanford Medical School with Doctor Abraham Verghese and what are we going to talk about? ABRAHAM VERGHESE: We're going to talk about the ritual of the physical exam, the bedside exam. SALMAN KHAN: The physical exam, the ritual-- why do you call it a ritual? That's interesting that you call it a ritual. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: Yeah, I think the lesson I've learned from hanging around with my anthropology colleagues here at Stanford is that rituals are all about transformation. A ritual signals the crossing of a threshold. You baptize to signal the crossing of a threshold, we marry to signal our departure from a life of solitude, loneliness, and misery to one of eternal bliss. SALMAN KHAN: Yes. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: So our lives are full of-- You shouldn't be laughing Sal. SALMAN KHAN: No. It resonates so strongly with me. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: So crossing a threshold is why we have a ritual. And I would say that the act of one individual coming to another, and telling them things they wouldn't tell their rabbi or their preacher, and then incredibly disrobing and allowing touch, I would say that that signals a ritual of incredible importance. And the fact that we, in the postmodern sort of medical world, have stopped seeing it that way and just see it as another data gathering tool may work for us, but I don't think it works for the patient. And I think that a major disconnect between us and our patients is our failure to see what they see, which is a profound ritual in which they're highly invested. And we then come and just stick our stethoscope on top of the shirt, or don't examine them thoroughly, we are sort of short changing ourselves of an important ritual. SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, and I'll feel short changed. I'm kidding. Sorry. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: But I'd love to list for you, if I may, those aspects of what makes this a ritual. So if you look at it, first of all there's always a specialized space. You don't examine a patient out in the corridor. It's always a special room, a ceremonial room if you will. Mysterious looking objects on the walls, a very specialized bed that you sit on. These are all signals that this is a virtual. Then when the physician walks in the physician often is wearing a ceremonial garb, which happens to be a white coat. SALMAN KHAN: Fascinating. This is interesting just from an anthropological point of view. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: The physician is wearing ceremonial garment. The patient is also instructed to disrobe and gets a patient garment. SALMAN KHAN: Which seems specially designed to put patients in a position of weakness. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: I know. It's quite unfortunate. We should be rethinking the [INAUDIBLE] garments [? major. ?] And then the physician then begins a systematic exam, which at some level is mysterious to the patient. It's not always clear to the patient why the physician is thumping on their chest or why the physician is saying take a deep breath, or cross your arms, or stand on tiptoe, or take your hand and touch your nose rapidly. So there's mysterious and ritualistic aspects to it. And very often the physician is using terms that are somewhat Latinate and arcane, and utterly mysterious to the patient such as fremitus, and percussion. SALMAN KHAN: What does fremitus mean? ABRAHAM VERGHESE: Fremitus means you ask the patient to say 99, and you listen, you put your hand on their chest. You pick up the vibration, and if they have consolidation or collapse the fremitus is not what it should be compared to the other side. SALMAN KHAN: The fremitus, so was it the sound or the-- ABRAHAM VERGHESE: It's more like the vibration. Sound being transmitted through and being picked up by your hand. SALMAN KHAN: Interesting. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: So the thing that's most interesting to me about the ritual is that the person coming in might be a policeman, a teacher, an entrepreneur, but in the process of putting on that gown, and sitting on that ceremonial chair, they have sort of been stripped of all that identity, and they are taking on the identity of being the patient. But conversely, I think there's something very important that happens, which is that just before this the patient has been vocalizing all their symptoms and their complaints, and at that point the physician could order ten tests, and go and look at images, but there's something about the physician then laying hands on the patient, that sort of gives weight to what the patient just talked about. You talk about your belly hurting, and then this individual carefully examines your belly. It's sort of validating your soma. Your body is being validated in this ritual. And then when you finally have the tests all sent off they become sort of-- what follows intuitively on the ritual of first having it validated on your body. One of the things that I bemoan sometimes is that at times the patient in the bed, I feel, in hospitals around America, has almost become an icon for the real patient who's in the computer. SALMAN KHAN: Right. It's just something to interface with to get to that data structure in the computer. It's interesting. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: I've coined a term for that entity in the computer. It's the iPatient. When the iPatient is getting fabulous care the real patient I think has a need to feel their complaints validated. To feel it validated on their soma, and to engage in a ritual for which there's a transformation. And you might well ask me, what is the transformation that takes place in this ritual? And, I think the transformation is the sense of the patient has delivered the story, the physician in the process of the ritual has validated that they've heard the story and tried to locate it on the soma, and the transformation is really the ceiling of the patient physician relationship. And so I think what has happened Sal, unfortunately, is that because we have so much technology we've become very sloppy in the way we examine patients. I think that we should be a hundredfold better at examining people given that we have real-time feedback with echocardiograms, angiograms, and all that. Instead of which, I think people have never been less certain of their bed side skills. SALMAN KHAN: What about this phenomenon, just talking to physicians I know in my own family, that there's so much time pressure. They have to see so many patients, one every 15 minutes, and all of this, and they wish they could do this, but they'll say that I have so many other things to worry about, and the paperwork, and all that. Is it realistic? ABRAHAM VERGHESE: No, I think that's a very real concern. But I think if you can do this well. And our goal at Stanford is to teach our students to do it very well. You actually save time. Because if you do a quick exam and you find that they're tender in a certain spot you can order the test that sources just that out, rather than, which I think is much more common, which is I don't really know what's going on, I'll tick off every box, and maybe something will fall out of the sky. So I think a directed exam, not only fulfills the ritual, but if you're any good at it, it actually allows you to ask better questions of a test you order and minimize the patient's exposure to radiation. And I think the trouble is we get all these tests, and we get back results we don't know what to do with, we stumble onto what we call incidentalomas. Have you heard that term? SALMAN KHAN: Incidentaloma. Well, I have heard that VIP's often get worse medical care because they do everything for them. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: Yeah, exactly and they wind up with finding things they don't know what to do. SALMAN KHAN: Exactly yeah over diagnosing things. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: But to come back to a ritual, I think we at Stanford are very proud to feel that, as much as we represent this great bastion of technology and advancement, we also celebrate the fundamental ritual aspects of the patient physician relationship, which is best symbolized in the physical exam. SALMAN KHAN: I think this is why a lot of physicians originally want to enter the field. It sometimes gets lost, but this is why they wanted to do it. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: And you're right. I think they often get disappointed when they learn to do this and arrive on the wards and find that no one's carrying a stethoscope, and no one's carrying-- I mean they carry the stethoscope. I think it's like a mating symbol. SALMAN KHAN: No you gotta carry one to look legitimate. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: But they don't carry the knee hammer, and they don't carry all the other tools. SALMAN KHAN: I once visited my wife at the doctor and I wore her coat, and I felt very good. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: Did you drape your stethoscope around the neck too? SALMAN KHAN: Oh I did. Yeah, I looked very authoritative. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: That's a great signal that you arrived. So I think that we have so much to learn from our anthropology colleagues about the importance of ritual. I think sometimes we operate as though medicine is all about reason, but it's really reason, ritual, emotion. They all tie in together. This is art and science. SALMAN KHAN: No. This is fascinating. I'm going to reflect on some of the rituals I do now to see if they are. Very cool. Well, thank you for this. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: Thank you so much.",science_health-and-medicine_healthcare-misc
" -  Let's say that we have a function, f of x, and it is equal to negative four times the cube root times the cube root of x. And what we want to do is we want to evaluate the derivative of our function when x is equal to eight. So see if you can figure this out. All right, now this might look foreign to you. You might say, well, I've never taken a derivative of a cube root before, but as we'll see, we can actually just apply the power rule here. Because this function can be rewritten as, so f of x can be rewritten as negative four. The cube root of x is the same thing as x to the one-third power. And now it might be a little bit clearer that we can apply the power rule. We could take this one-third, multiply it by this co-efficient, negative four. So we have negative four times one-third, and you have times x to the one-third. We just decrement that exponent to, that's a different shade of blue, to the one-third minus one power. This is the derivative. So f prime of x is equal to that, and so now we just have to simplify. This is equal negative four-thirds times x. One-third minus one is negative two-thirds power. And so if we want to evaluate f prime of eight, f prime of eight is equal to negative four-thirds times eight to the negative two-thirds power. Well that's the same thing as negative four-thirds times eight, eight to the one-third, and then raise that to negative two power. I'm just using exponent properties here. If this looks completely unfamiliar how I got from that to that, I encourage you to review exponent properties on Khan Academy. Well eight to the one-third, that is just two. So this is just two, and then two to the negative two power. Remember, let me just take some steps here. It's a good review. This is equal to negative four-thirds times two to the negative two is the same thing as one over two to the two. These two things are equivalent. That and that. One over two to the two is the same thing as two to the negative two. So this is one over four, and so this is going to simplify to negative one over three. Is equal to negative one over three, and we are done.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-derivative-rules
" So if you've gotten this far, you've been waiting for several videos to get to the optimal line that minimizes the squared distance to all of those points. So let's just get to the punch line. Let's solve for the optimal m and b. And just based on what we did in the last videos, there's two ways to do that. We actually now know two points that lie on that line. So we can literally find the slope of that line and then the the y intercept, the b there. Or, we could just say it's the solution to this system of equations. And they're actually mathematically equivalent. So let's solve for m first. And if we want to solve for m, we want to cancel out the b's. So let me rewrite this top equation just the way it's written over here. We have m times the mean of the x squareds plus b times the mean of-- Actually, we could even do it better than that. One step better than that is to, based on the work we did in the last video, we can just subtract this bottom equation from this top equation. So let me subtract it. Or let's add the negatives. So if I make this negative, this is negative. This is negative. What do we get? We get m times the mean of the x's minus the mean of the x squareds over the mean of x. The plus b and the negative b cancel out. Is equal to the mean of the y's minus the mean of the xy's over the mean of the x's. And then, we can divide both sides of the equation by this. And so we get m is equal to the mean of the y's minus the mean of the xy's over the mean of the x's over this. The mean of the x's minus the mean of the x squareds over the mean of the x's. Now notice, this is the exact same thing that you would get if you found the slope between these two points over here. Change in y, so the difference between that y and that y, is that right over there. Over the change in x's. The change in that x minus that x is exactly this over here. Now, to simplify it, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the mean of the x's. And I do that just so we don't have this in the denominator both places. So if we multiply the numerator by the mean of the x's, we get the mean of the x's times the mean of the y's minus, this and this will cancel out, minus the mean of the xy's. All of that over, mean of the x's times the mean of the x's is just going to be the mean of the x's squared, minus over here you have the mean of the x squared. And that's what we get for m. And if we want to solve for b, we literally can just substitute back into either equation, but this equation right here is simpler. And so if we wanted to solve for b there, we can solve for b in terms of m. We just subtract m times the mean of x's from both sides. We get b is equal to the mean of the y's minus m times the mean of the x's. So what you do is you take your data point. You find the mean of the x's, the mean of the y's , the mean of the xy's, the mean of the x's squared. You find your m. Once you find your m, then you can substitute back in here and you find your b. And then you have your actual optimal line. And we're done. So these are the two big formula take aways for our optimal line. What I'm going to do in the next video, and this is where if anyone wasn't skipping up to this point, the next video is where they should re-engage, because we're actually going to use these formulas for the best fitting line. At least, when you measure the error by the squared distances from the points. We're going to use these formulas to actually find the best line for some data.",math_statistics-probability_describing-relationships-quantitative-data
"  Imagine that we've got your arm here, and you got these nice big strong muscles, and you're holding in your hand a weight. Let's say that you're holding a two-pound weight. Here is a two-pound weight. Let's say that you are holding it in your hand and you want to lift it up. As you lift this two-pound weight, you notice that there is some resistance, and you definitely are able to notice that there is a weight in your hand. Let's say that we took this weight and you didn't know, let's say I grabbed the weight out of your hand and I replaced it with another weight that was 2.05 pounds. I've got this 2.05-pound weight, and it's the same exact shape and everything, and it's just .05 pounds heavier. Let's say that we replaced this guy with the 2.05-pound weight. Let's say that I asked you to lift this new 2.05-pound weight, and you might lift it, and you may notice that it's different, but most people in general would not notice any difference. They would just think it's the same exact two-pound weight. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that this .05-pound increase in the weight, for most people probably, would not be noticeable. Let's say that instead of giving you a 2.05-pound weight let's say that I gave you a weight that was 2.2 pounds, and let's say you close your eyes and I took this two-pound weight out of your hand, and I replaced it with this new 2.2-pound weight, and then I ask you to lift the new weight. Most people would probably notice this new increase, this new weight. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that a addition of .05 pounds probably wouldn't get noticed, whereas an addition of 0.2 pounds would get noticed. The threshold at which you're able to notice an increase or a change in weight or really any sensation so that threshold, where you go from not noticing a tiny little change to actually noticing a tiny little change is known as the just noticeable difference, noticeable difference. We can abbreviate this as JNT. In this case, the just noticeable difference, let's say for just sake of argument, is .2 pounds, .2 pounds. OK. Let's imagine that instead of starting with a two-pound weight, instead, we started with a five-pound weight, so five-pound weight. The five-pound weight is much heavier than the two-pound weight. In this case, if I replace the five-pound weight with a 5.2-pound weight, because it's a lot heavier and you're using a lot more muscle fibers in order to lift the five-pound weight, you may not notice the .2-pound increase. Whereas if I replaced the five-pound weight with a 5-1/2-pound weight, so 5.5-pound weight, and I asked you to lift it, you might notice the half a pound increase, but you might not notice the .2-pound increase. Basically, what's going on here is that since you're using more muscle fibers, you're using more sensory neurons, they're not as sensitive to small increases. They're not as sensitive to the 0.2-pound increase. You need a bigger just noticeable difference in order to actually be mentally aware of the change in weight. Basically, when you're holding five pounds, let's say for sake of argument, the just noticeable difference is a little bit higher than when you're holding two pounds. Now, these numbers we're just throwing around, and if you actually did this experimentally, the actual numbers might be different, but the concept generally would remain the same. In the five-pound weight category, the just noticeable difference is .5 pounds. From this, we can come up with an equation. Let's just define some variables. I, or the intensity of the stimulus, is equal to two pounds in this case and five pounds in this case. And delta I, so delta I, would be the just noticeable difference. It would be 5.5 pounds minus five pounds equals half a pound. For the five-pound example, I would be five, and delta I would be .5, and then in the two-pound example, I would be two, and delta I would be .2. Basically, there is actually a guy back in the day named Weber. Weber noticed in 1834 that the ratio of the increment threshold, the ratio of the increment threshold, which is this over here, to the background intensity, which is this over here, so this is the background intensity, is constant. If we were to take .2 divided by two, and if we were to take .5 divided by five, this ratio is actually equal, and it equals .1, and this ratio would be more or less fairly constant for a bunch of different weights. That's what Weber's law is. Weber, in 1834, realized that there is this relationship. We can write this as an equation. Delta I over I equals K. K is a constant for each individual person. There is this particular threshold, and the ratio, the background intensity to the incremental threshold is relatively constant, and that constant is this K value. This part of the equation over here is known as the Weber fraction. This works for sensory tactile stimuli like lifting a weight but it also works for auditory stimuli. Imagine you're in a quiet room. If you're in a quiet room with someone else, you can whisper. You can talk really, really softly and the person can hear you. But if you're at a rock concert, you have to be yelling at the top of your lungs in order for someone next to you to hear you. That's because the background intensity in a quiet room versus a concert is different, and so the delta I, which is whether you're just whispering or whether you're yelling, is different in accordance with the background intensity. That's what the Weber's law is basically saying. If we take this equation over here, let me just give myself a little bit of space. If we take this equation, Weber's law, and rearrange it, so we have delta I equals the background intensity times this constant, if we arrange it, we can see that this Weber's law predicts a linear relationship between the incremental threshold, which is this value over here, and the background intensity. In other words, as the background intensity gets bigger, the incremental threshold gets bigger. If we were to draw a little graph, if we were to draw a graph where the x-axis is the background intensity and the y-axis was the incremental, the difference threshold, what we would see would be this linear relationship. Using the concert example over here, a really, really big background intensity would result in a delta I, so this would be ... Let's say delta I in this case was how loud you were talking. The delta I would have to be a lot bigger than if you were in a quiet room, so quiet room. This law would generally hold true for almost any type of stimulus. It's a good rule of thumb. It's not exactly set in stone, but it is kind of how most of your different sensations operate, where if there is a bigger background intensity, you need a bigger difference threshold in order to actually perceive the sensation. In the real world, sometimes people add a different value. You got delta I over I equals K. This is the normal Weber's law. Some people will even add in another constant over here in order to take into account the baseline level of activity that needs to be surpassed in real-world situations. So this equation can be modified in order to more accurately represent what goes on in the real world.",science_health-and-medicine_nervous-system-and-sensory-infor
" -  Let's say that we wanted to take the indefinite integral of X squared times three X minus one DX. Pause this video and see if you can evaluate this. So, you might be saying oh, what kind of fancy technique could I use? But you will see sometimes the fanciest or maybe the least fancy but the best technique is to just simplify this algebraically. So, in this situation what would happens if we distribute this X squared? Well, then we're going to get a polynomial here within the integral, so this is going to be equal to the integral of X squared times three X is three X to the third and then negative one times X squared is minus X squared and then that times DX and now this is pretty straightforward to evaluate. This is going to be equal to the anti-derivative of X to the third is X to the fourth over four so this is going to be three times X to the fourth over four, I could write it that way or let me just write it X to the fourth over four and then the anti-derivative of X squared is X to the third over three, so minus X to the third over three and this is an indefinite integral, there might be a constant there, so let me write that down and we're done. The big takeaway is you just have to do a little bit of distribution to get a form where it's easier to evaluate the anti-derivative. Let's do another example. Let's say that we want to take the indefinite integral of, this is gonna be a hairy expression, so X to the third plus three X squared minus five, all of that over X squared DX. What would this be? Pause the video again and see if you can figure it out. So, once again your brain might want to try to do some fancy tricks or whatever else but the main insight here is to realize that you could just simplify it algebraically. What happens if you just divide each of these terms by X squared? Well, then this thing is going to be equal to, that's in parentheses here, X to the third divided by X squared is just going to be X. Three X squared divided by X squared is just three and then negative five divided by X squared, you could just write that as negative five times X to the negative two power. And so, once again we just need to use the reverse power rule here to take the anti-derivative. This is going to be, let's see the anti-derivative of X is X squared over two, X squared over two plus the anti-derivative of three would just be three X. The anti-derivative of negative five X to the negative two. So, we would increment the exponent by one, positive one and then divide by that value. So, it would be negative five X to the negative one, we're adding one to the negative one, all of that divided by negative one which is the same, we could write it like that. Well, these two would just, you would have minus and then you're dividing by negative one, so it's really just going, we can rewrite it like this plus five X to the negative one and you could take the derivative of this to verify that it would indeed give you that and of course we can't forget our plus C, never forget that if you're taking an indefinite integral. Alright, let's just do one more for good measure. Let's say we're taking the indefinite integral of the cube root of X to the fifth DX. Pause the video and see if you can evaluate this. Try to write it a little bit neater. X to the fifth DX. Pause the video and try to figure it out. So, here the realization is well, if you just rewrite all this as one exponent, so this is equal to the indefinite integral of X to the fifth to the one third, I just rewrote the cube root as the one third power DX, which is the same thing as the integral of X to the, if I raise something to a power and then raise that to a power I can multiply those two exponents, that's just exponent properties, X to the five thirds DX, many of you might have just gone straight to this step right over here and then once again, we just have to use the reverse power rule. This is going to be X to the, we increment this five thirds by one or we can add three thirds to it, so it's X to the eight thirds and then we divide by eight thirds or multiply by its reciprocal so we could just say three eighths times X to the eight thirds and of course, we have our plus C and verify this. If you use the power rule here you'd have eight thirds times the three eights, will just give you a coefficient of one and then you decrement this by three thirds or one, you get to five thirds which is exactly what we originally had. So, the big takeaway of this video, many times the most powerful integration technique is literally just algebraic simplification first.",math_integral-calculus_ic-integration
" -  So part c. Find the x-coordinates of all points of inflection for the graph of f. Give a reason for your answer. So points of inflection, points of inflection happen when we go from concave upwards, concave upwards to downwards or vice versa. So this is true if and only if f prime prime of x goes from positive to negative or vice versa. So where do we see f prime prime of x going from positive to negative? Well that's going to be true if and only if f prime of x goes from being increasing to decreasing or vice versa. F prime goes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. We're seeing a lot of vice versa here. So now let's, and I want you to think of it in terms of f prime because we have the graph of f prime. So f prime goes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa or we could go from decreasing to increasing. Let's think about it. Let's see, over here, f prime is decreasing, decreasing, decreasing, decreasing and then it increases. So we have a point of inflection right over here, right? When f prime of x is zero. That's because a prime is differentiable so the derivative is definitely, the derivative is zero right at that point of inflection right over here. So with that happens at x equals negative one. And over here, then f prime starts increasing but then right at x equals one then it starts decreasing. So at x equals one, we have another point of inflection. That's where we have that zero, that zero of tangent line with slope zero. And then we're decreasing, decreasing, decreasing, decreasing, decreasing, increasing. All right, so this is going to be another point of inflection, x equals three. So these are at three points of inflection. So this happens, happens at x equals negative one, x equals one and x equals three. So these three points on our graph of f prime where we see f prime goes from decreasing to increasing or increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing. All right, all right. Now, well, I'll do the last part on the next video.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-solved-exams
" Simplify the expression 18x to the fourth minus 3x squared plus 6x minus 4, all of that over 6x. So there's a couple ways to think about them. They're all really equivalent. You can really just view this up here as being the exact same thing as 18x to the fourth over 6x plus negative 3x squared over 6x, or you could say minus 3x squared over 6x, plus 6x over 6x, minus 4 over 6x. Now, there's a couple of ways to think about it. One is I just kind of decomposed this numerator up here. If I just had a bunch of stuff, a plus b plus c over d, that's clearly equal to a/d plus b/d plus c/d. Or maybe not so clearly, but hopefully that helps clarify it. Another way to think about it is kind of like you're distributing the division. If I divide a whole expression by something, that's equivalent to dividing each of the terms by that something. The other way to think about it is that we're multiplying this entire expression. So this is the same thing as 1 over 6x times this entire thing, times 18x to the fourth minus 3x squared plus 6x minus 4. And so here, this would just be the straight distributive property to get to this. Whatever seems to make sense for you-- they're are all equivalent. They're all logical, good things to do to simplify this thing. Now, once you have it here, now we just have a bunch of monomials that we're just dividing by 6x. And here, we could just use exponent properties. This first one over here, we can take the coefficients and divide them. 18 divided by 6 is 3. And then you have x to the fourth divided by x to the-- well, they don't tell us. But if it's just an x, that's the same thing as x to the first power. So it's x to the fourth divided by x to the first. That's going to be x to the 4 minus 1 power, or x to the third power. Then we have this coefficient over here, or these coefficients. We have negative 3 divided by 6. So I'm going to do this part next. Negative 3 divided by 6 is negative 1/2. And then you have x squared divided by x. We already know that x is the same thing as x to the first. So that's going to be x to the 2 minus 1 power, which is just 1. Or I could just leave it as an x right there. Then we have these coefficients, 6 divided by 6. Well, that's just 1. So I could just-- well, I'll write it. I could write a 1 here. And let me just write the 1 here, because we said 2 minus 1 is 1. And then x divided by x is x to the first over x to the first. You could view it two ways-- anything divided by anything is just 1. Or you could view it as x to the 1 divided by x to the 1 is going to be x to the 1 minus 1, which is x to the 0, which is also equal to 1. Either way, you knew how to do this before you even learned that exponent property. Because x divided by x is 1, and then assuming x does not equal to 0. And we kind of have to assume x doesn't equal 0 in this whole thing. Otherwise, we would be dividing by 0. And then finally, we have 4 over 6x. And there's a couple of ways to think about it. So the simplest way is negative 4 over 6 is the same thing as negative 2/3. Just simplified that fraction. And we're multiplying that times 1/x. So we can view this 4 times 1/x. Another way to think about it is you could have viewed this 4 as being multiplied by x to the 0 power, and this being x to the first power. And then when you tried to simplify it using your exponent properties, you would have-- well, that would be x to the 0 minus 1 power, which is x to the negative 1 power. So we could have written an x to the negative 1 here, but x to the negative 1 is the exact same thing as 1 over x. And so let's just write our answer completely simplified. So it's going to be 3x to the third minus 1/2 x plus 1-- because this thing right here is just 1-- and then minus 2 times 1 in the numerator over 3 times x in the denominator. And we are done. Or we could write this. Depending on what you consider more simplified, this last term right here could also be written in minus 2/3 x to the negative 1. But if you don't want a negative exponent, you could write it like that.",math_algebra-home_alg-polynomials
" Let's say that these are your lungs. This is your right lung. This is your left lung. We're just going to label them upper and this will be lower. This will be the middle lobe. You're minding your own business and somebody coughs, and they get TB in your lungs. That TB gets inhaled, you breathe it in, and the location that the TB likes to go to, it's actually a pretty interesting thing, is it likes to go along these fissures that I'm drawing out here. These are the fissures; They separate the lobes of the lungs. They are kind of like the boundaries. The TB bacteria like to go near those fissures. They also actually like to go sub-pleural. Pleural indicates the outside layer of the lung. So, if it's sub, it's right underneath that outside layer. They like to go somewhere along the fissure and somewhere in the sub-pleural space; right on the edge. They're going to jump into some alveoli. Let me just draw it out for you here. You know, you've got millions of these guys; I'm going to draw a few more, just to make it really clear that these things are in packs. What's going to happen is, of course, you're going to have an immune response right away to this bacterium that's in there. You might have a macrophage coming along like that. This macrophage is going to pick up the bacteria that's now landed inside of that air sac, and it's going to take a journey through the tissue of the lung. It's going to go and drain down to a local lymph node. This is a local lymph node; a neighborhood lymph node. Let me label it right here; lymph node. That's the journey that the macrophage is going to take; not every single one, but some of them are going to go to the lymph node. What they do by doing that is, they actually carry with them the micro bacterium. This little bacterium is now carried along, going for the ride, and now the bacteria is in two spots. It's in the original spot where it landed in the lungs, but it's also in the lymph node because it got carried there by the macrophage. I should've mentioned this earlier, but let's assume that this is your primary infection. In other words, this is the first time that this person, or I guess it could be you or me, is breathing in the TB bacteria. What's going to happen is, there's going to be a reaction. The micro bacterium and the macrophages are going to start warring. They're going to fight. You're going to get this entire area turned into literally a battlefield, with dead micro bacterium and some dead macrophages. Some of your own cells are going to be part of this, but a lot of it is just going to be the bacteria. You're going to get some of this battlefield going on over here as well, in this lymph node. That's what it's going to turn into; a giant battlefield. If you look under a microscope, it actually looks like, well we call it a granuloma. That's the description that a pathologist might use for what we are actually describing here. The same thing is true for the lymph node. There's a little granuloma in there as well. If you were to peek inside of this granuloma, let's just actually erase the center out, if you were to peek inside, let's say I was to cut it open, what you would see is, inside of this granuloma is literally this mess; this goo that somebody at some point, thought looked like cheese. I'm not sure how they came up with that conclusion, but it kind of stuck. So, we call this caseous necrosis. Caseous literally refers to cheese. This is the same kind of cheese that might go on your crackers. Cheese, and you can think of it almost like cheesy death I guess; cheesy death for the necrosis part. I think I added an extra ""e"" there by accident. Let me fix that with a little hyphen. So, cheesy death. Because I'm naming things, let me go ahead and give you a couple more names. Ghon Focus; what the heck does that mean? Ghon Focus, actually named after Dr. Ghon. Ghon Focus is what we call this thing. It's termed a granuloma, and specifically here because it's a granuloma, which is more a broad term, is in the sub-pleural space, we said, and it's close to a fissure, and we suspect it's from TB. We would call it a Ghon Focus; it's the other name for it. Both of these, if you're trying to name both of these together, the lymph node that has a granuloma and the Ghon Focus, together make up what we call the Ghon Complex; Ghon complex. That just refers to both of the areas of disease. This is how disease starts, but what happens after time passes? Let me just slide this over a little bit. If we then take a little bit of passage of time. Let's say there are three options. Time has passed. What are the different possibilities? Well, let me actually go through and talk about micro bacterium; micro bacterium tuberculosis from the standpoint of what is going on. Actually, I just noticed, I have in the past made the mistake of using a capital T, but it should be a lower case t. Micro bacterium tuberculosis; three options. One option is that the bacterium may be dead. You may have killed it with your macrophages. Another option is that the bacterium is dormant; it's just lying in wait. The third option is that it's multiplying like crazy; it's actually going and dividing and dividing and dividing. The last one, actually, is going to look - if you looked on a chest x-ray, like this, you see lots of disease; this red indicates diseased tissue, not normal tissue. You might even see some large diseased lymph nodes. That's what it'd look like on a chest x-ray. These other two, on a chest x-ray, basically would look normal. If you were to look at a chest x-ray, this is what the three options would look like. The first two would look normal, and the third one would look like something is wrong. Actually, this is helpful, because remember, these two together, we call these, both situations we call them latent TB infection. Remember, we can't really easily distinguish the two because in both situations, you've had prior exposure to TB, and in both situations the x-ray looks normal. If you had some super ability to actually zoom in; let's say you looked under a microscope, you would notice one key difference between these two. This is not something you can see on a chest x-ray, you can see only if you had amazing vision and could look down at the microscopic level at somebody's lungs. You'd see macrophages, and in the top case where there are dead bacteria, the macrophages would look healthy and happy. In the case where you have dormant bacteria, you would actually see some bacteria there; some red, live bacteria. That's the key difference between these two situations. Again, both of them we call latent TB infection. In this scenario, the bottom one, is going to be called progressive because things are slowly but surely getting worse; you can see more disease on the chest x-ray. Primary, with a 1 and a degree sign, infection; this is the name for this, progressive primary infection. It sounds a lot like what we had named that here, with primary infection, but the word progressive tells us that things are actually getting worse. The disease is getting more nasty. Now, let's actually play out the rest of this. Let's think about what will happen with the dormant situation. I wrote out, or drew this out, earlier. Let's say more time is passing, of course. Maybe years have gone by. This person has had live bacteria in their lungs for years and years; nothing has happened. Now, they have what we call reactivation; maybe it's because their immune system is not working properly, or maybe they have another disease. Who knows why, but all of a sudden, now the bacteria, the TB bacteria, are going to come out with a vengeance. There's going to be a cavity that forms; usually in the upper lobes. A cavity that forms up here. It's going to be packed full of TB bacteria. This person, you could imagine, if they coughed, they're going to be coughing out lots and lots of these little bacteria that i'm drawing. Around that area there's a lot of disease; a lot of disease in this area and it's very, very distinct. If you see cavities, and you see lots and lots of disease, you're really going to be worried that this person might have what we call progressive secondary infection. The reason I'm saying secondary is because, again, this is happening separate from that primary infection; this is happening sometimes years later. Another way you can actually have this happen is through what we call a secondary infection. Maybe you actually literally get more TB. Maybe you're on a bus or a boat, and a second person decides to cough and TB gets into your lungs through breathing it in. That's another way to actually get progressive secondary infection. You can also think that this is re-infection, because you basically got re-infected with the same bug. The thing that ties reactivation together with re-infection is that in both situations your immune system has at some point in the past been exposed to TB. We think that's the main reason why you see these cavities, and you see so much disease. That's a really horrible infection to get. So, thinking about this a little bit more broadly then, both the progressive primary infection, and the progressive secondary infection, who are the folks that you'd be most worried getting these diseases? I always worry about HIV patients before 1any other group because we know 1that HIV and TB is a really, really bad combination. 1They're at high risk for getting 1progressive disease; both primary, 1which is at the time that they 1got the first infection with TB, 1or secondary which could be years later.",science_health-and-medicine_infectious-diseases
" -  Let's say that I have a random variable X which is equal to the number of dogs that I see in a day. And random variable Y is equal to the number of cats that I see in a day. Let's say I also know what the mean of each of these random variables are, the expected value. So the expected value of X which I could also denote as the mean of our random variable X let's say I expect to see three dogs a day and similarly for the cats, the expected value of Y is equal to I could also denote that as the mean of Y is going to be equal to and this is just for the sake of (mumbles) let's say I expect to see four cats a day. And pretty much we define how you take the mean of a random variable or the expected value for a random variable. What we're going to think about now is what would be the expected value of X plus Y or other way of saying that the mean of the sum of these two random variables. Well it turns out, and I'm not proving it just yet, that the mean of the sum of random variables is equal to the sum of the means. So this is going to be equal to the mean of random variable X plus the mean of random variable Y. And so in this particular case, if I were to say well what's the expected number of dogs and cats that I would see in a given day. Well I would add these two means, it would be three plus four it would be equal to seven, so in this particular case it is equal to three plus four which is equal to seven. And similarly if I were to ask you the difference if I were to say how many more cats in a given day would I expect to see than dogs, so the expected value of Y minus X. What would that be? Well intuitively you might say well hey if we can add random... If the expected value of the sum is the sum of the expected values, then the expected value or the mean of the difference will be the differences of the means and that is absolutely true. So this is the same thing as the mean of Y minus X which is equal to the mean of Y is going to be equal to the mean of Y minus the mean of X, minus the mean of X. And in this particular case, it would be equal to four minus three, minus three is equal to one. So another way of thinking about this intuitively is I would expect to see on a given day one more cat than dog. The example that I just used this is discrete random variables, on a given day I wouldn't see 2.2 dogs or pi dogs, the expected value itself does not have to be a whole number 'cause you could of course average it over many days. But this same idea that the mean of a sum is the same thing as a sum of means and the mean of a difference of random variables is the same as the difference of the means. In a future video I'll do a proof of this.",math_statistics-probability_random-variables-stats-library
"  We've done a lot of aldol condensations, and in particular, we've looked at the mechanism in great detail. In this video, we're going to think about doing things in reverse. So we're going to start with a retro aldol reaction and see how that way of thinking can apply to retro synthesis. And so let's start with cinnamaldehyde right here. And if we do a retro aldol reaction, the mechanism is pretty much the exact reverse of an aldol condensation. And so if we had a base like sodium carbonate, we're gonna form benzaldehyde and acid aldehyde. A cinnamaldehyde is the molecule that gives cinnamon its smell, and benzaldehyde smells like almonds, and so this is a pretty cool experiment to do. You can stat with the molecule that smells like cinnamon and end with a molecule that smells like almonds. Let's analyze our cinnamaldehyde starting compound here to see how we would have formed those products. We know the carbon next to our carbonyl is our alpha carbon. And we know the carbon next to that is the beta carbon. And so looking at the structure, all right, we know that there's a hydrogen attached to our alpha carbon like that. So we think about breaking this double bonds, right? We can see this this two carbon setup over here on the right for acid aldehyde, right, so those are the two carbons, and this is the hydrogen that's bonded to that alpha carbon there. Looking at the structure again on the right, we know that there are two more hydrogens bonded to that alpha carbon, and so therefore, if we're doing things in reverse, we can think about adding two hydrogens to this alpha carbon, and then go ahead and draw two hydrogens right here, so I'm just going to write H2. And then we can think about adding an oxygen to the beta carbons, and we can think about adding H2O. I know there's already a hydrogen on that beta carbon, so I could think about this being the hydrogen on that carbon. All right and then if I add an oxygen to that carbon, that would be this oxygen right here. So just a, a way of thinking in reverse, right? Adding water, right, breaking your double bond and adding an oxygen and two hydrogens will, is one way of thinking about forming your product here. So or you can think about the reverse. You can think about losing water from this portion and sticking these two fragments together to give you your aldol condensation product. So once again, this way of thinking can be can be very useful if you're trying to retro synthesize something, so if you're thinking in reverse. So for example, let's say a question on a test was show how you could synthesize this enone here, so once again we're gonna do the same kind of analysis. We're gonna find our alpha carbon right here; this is our alpha carbon, and this is beta carbon. All right, so attached to our alpha carbon, all right, we know that there's a hydrogen right here, so we're gonna think about breaking this double bond, right? So let's go ahead and draw a retro synthesis arrow here. So we're gonna break that double bond, so on the left, all right, we're gonna have our benzine ring. We're gonna have our carbonyl here. And then we're gonna have a hydrogen attached to this carbon, attached to our alpha carbon. And remember, we're gonna add two hydrogens to our alpha carbon. So we're gonna add two hydrogens to our alpha carbon, and that would give us the ketone that we would need. Right, for our beta carbon, we know there's already a hydrogen attached right here, and so we're going to add an oxygen to this beta carbon on the left, so this is our way of thinking about it. So over here on the right we're gonna have we're gonna have our carbonyl. All right, and then we're adding an oxygen, right, we're adding a oxygen right here. And then we had that hydrogen, so I'm gonna go ahead and draw that hydrogen in blue. And then we can go ahead and draw our ring. So we have our ring right here. And then we have our nitro group coming off over here. So just to check ourselves and make sure that this is the right way of thinking about it in reverse, if we take water from this portion, right? And stick those two fragments together. Then that would give us our conjugated enone product over here on the left. And so that's, again, one way of thinking about how to do these sorts of problems. And so if they if they wanted you to give some some reaction conditions here, you can go ahead and, and draw what you would need, right? So you would say, I need to start with this ketone, right? Like this and then I would also need an aldehyde, so I'm redrawing the 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde product, right? So we have 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde like this. All right, so this compound, this ketone, of course, is this compound right here. And then 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde here is the same one that we drew right here. So if you take those two, right, and you, and you put them together, you should form your conjugated enone. Because remember, thinking about your alpha protons, right, there are no alpha protons on our 4-Nitrobenzaldehyde. Right, so this,this carbon right here doesn't have any alpha protons, so the only source for alpha protons would be this carbon right here. This is your only alpha carbon with alpha protons on it. So in terms of in terms of what else we would need, we would need a base, all right, to do our alpha condensation, so we could add a something like sodium hydroxide as our base. And we could we could create a solution of sodium hydroxide and water, and then also ethanol so if you took these ketone right in this aldehyde and use these reaction conditions, you should form the conjugate enone as your major product. And so that how to how to synthesize it, so once again thinking in reverse. Let's do another one. This one's a little bit different because we don't have an enone for an enol as our target compound. We have an aldol as our target compound. Well, we can use the same kind of thinking. We can find our carbonyl and identify the carbon next to that as being our alpha carbon and then thinking about this as being our beta carbon, right? And we know that this is the bond that forms. So we can think about breaking this bond. And and we know right, we know that we have a hydrogen on this carbon right here, as I'm just gonna see if I can stick it into there. So when I think about retrosynthesis, all right I go ahead and draw my retrosynthesis arrow in here, so on the left, I mean I can see on the left that I'm going to have this carbon two, three, four and five, right? So I have these five carbons right here so, we go ahead and draw those in. So we have our carbonyl, and then we have our five carbons, and then I already have this hydrogen in magenta, and we're only going to add on hydrogen this time. So let me go ahead and draw in one hydrogen in green because this isn't the congregated product. We stopped at the aldol if you're thinking about it in reverse. So we're not going to add two hydrogens, we're only going to add one here, and so what else would we need; so over here on the right, let's think about the fact that there is hydrogen attached to this carbon right here. And then how many carbons will we have for our other compound, one two three and four, so we need a 4-carbon carbonyl. Right, and there's a hydrogen attached to it, so a 4-carbon, carbonyl. Let me go ahead and draw that in, one, two, three four, and then we have this hydrogen ion glued to it. So now, we've identified and thinking about it in reverse, what compounds we would need to form this aldol product. We would need this ketone and this aldehyde. But, in terms of in terms of actually synthesizing the aldol compound on the left, we have to be a little bit careful about how to do it. We need to do a directed aldol addition here, so let's think about starting with this ketone, all right? So think about starting with this ketone here, so let me go ahead and redraw it. I'm going to draw it in a slightly different way. All right, so that's this ketone right here. And to that ketone, we're going to add LDA. So we're going to form a lithium enolate here, and once we've formed our lithium enolate, then we can add our aldehyde. So in our second step, we can add our aldehyde in here, so we talked about this in earlier video. So we have our aldehyde as a 4-carbon aldehyde, all right, so we're going to add butanal. And then that's going to give us a, a lithium alkoxide, right? So we need to we need to protonate the alkoxide, so in the workup, we can add some water here. And that would give us our aldol product, so that would give us this, so that is the way to synthesize our aldol products. Let me go ahead and draw it in here, right, so we would form this. Okay, so a directed aldol addition. Let's do, let's do one more of this retrosynthesis approach. And let's think about how to make this molecule. So this is a little bit different than before. Okay, but we can do our same stuff. So we can identify our alpha carbon, right, the one next to our carbonyl. And then our beta carbon is the one next to that, right? So we can think about breaking this double bond, all right, and adding two hydrogens to our alpha carbon, right? So let’s go ahead and do that, so we’re going to break that double bond and add two hydrogens to the alpha carbons, so thinking about this in terms of retrosynthesis, we have a ring here. All right and then let me, let me go ahead and draw this over here. We would have two hydrogens over here. Let me go ahead and get some more room. All right, so probably easier to think about adding your oxygen to your beta carbon first, so let's do that. All right, we know we're gonna add an oxygen to our beta carbon. So let's go ahead and put in our oxygen on our beta carbon; I'll do that in green. Right, and then we're gonna think about two hydrogens to our alpha carbons, so we're gonna draw in our alpha carbon like that, and we're gonna add two hydrogens; I'm gonna put those in green like this. And this is a little bit more room, and then we would have our carbonyl like that, and then we would have to make sure count your carbons when we're doing these. All right? So let's go ahead and show those carbons. So this carbon right here is this carbon. All right. And then, this carbon is this one right here. And then this carbon, our carbonyl one is right here. 1And so you can see this is actually an intramolecular aldol condensation. 1So if you think about losing water right here, right, and sticking those 1two fragments together, you would form this compound on the left, and so this 1is a pretty cool reaction. 1Right, we could we could redraw this, right, so 1on an exam, right, you might, I mean, you 1could draw it like that, but most of the 1time, you would see it in a different conformation. 1All right, so you would see the compound looking like this. 1So let me go ahead and draw that. 1So identify your carbons. 1Carbon in magenta is the one right here. 1Carbon in blue is the one right here. 1And the carbon in red is the one right here, which has your carbonyl. 1And then we are going to go ahead and make our alpha carbon 1right here green, so this carbon right here, so this must have been, this 1must have been your starting compound, right, and so if you add a 1base, right, you can convert, you can 1convert this molecule into your target compound. 1So once again an intramolecular aldol condensation. 1And we'll talk in more detail about those in the next video.",science_organic-chemistry_ochem-alpha-carbon-chemistry
"  So your next patient just walked in, and his name is Joe. And he's here because he hasn't been feeling so well. He tells you that for the past few weeks, he's been feeling really tired. So just not like his normal self. And he thinks that he's lost some weight. So you check up on that, and you find out that he's actually lost a significant amount of weight. And he looks a lot thinner and weaker than he usually does. So you talk to him, you calm him down, and then you start to examine him, and right away you notice that his skin looks a lot paler than it usually does. So this is what Joe normally looks like, but today he looks a little bit more like this. And you notice that he has bruises all throughout his body. And when you ask him about the bruises, he actually can't remember getting them. He doesn't remember ever getting hurt. And when you check his temperature, you see that he has a fever. So as you're finishing your exam, he tells you, ""Well, you know, I've been feeling this pain ""throughout my body, and it feels like the pain ""is inside my bones, and inside my joints."" So he's also been having some bone pain. So if you're worried about Joe, then your instincts are on point, because there's definitely something serious going on over here. But at his point, you probably don't know what that is. Is this infection, is it cancer, is it some rare, crazy disease? It's really hard to tell at this stage. So you might start off by ordering some basic studies, some basic labs, and one of the labs that you might order would be a CBC. And a CBC stands for Complete Blood Count. And it's a really cheap and easy test to get, but it tells you a lot of information. So this is the typical information that you get from a CBC. So it tells you the number of red blood cells that you have, it gives you your hemoglobin, and your hematocrit values, which are indirect ways of measuring how many red blood cells you have, it'll give you a platelet count, and it'll give you a white blood cell count. And these are the normal values, just for reference. So hint, hint, Joe has leukemia, but we don't know that yet, because we're still working him up. So a CBC shows us that he has a decrease in his red blood cell count, and that's called anemia. And he also has a decrease in his hemoglobin and hematocrit. And that's just from the decrease in the red blood cell numbers. And he also has a decrease in his platelet count, and that's called thrombocytopenia. And finally, he has a decrease in his white blood cell count, and that's called leukopenia. But actually, in leukemia, you could also see an increase in the white blood cell count. And that's because in leukemia, eventually the leukemia cells run out of space to grow inside the bone marrow, and when that happens, they leak into the blood, and you start to see them in the blood. And these leukemia cells are usually immature white blood cells, just because most leukemias are white blood cell leukemias. So the person who's counting all of these cells, who's giving us our CBC values, sees these immature white blood cells, sees these leukemia cells, and he or she counts them as white blood cells. And that's why you have an increase in the white blood cell count. But if you looked more closely at the blood, you'd actually see that the number of healthy mature white blood cells is always decreased. So this CBC is really concerning. It tells us that our patient, Joe, has a shortage in the number of all of his blood cells. And that actually accounts for most of the symptoms that he came in with. So you should feel like you're heading in the right direction towards finding out what's wrong with him. And you might wonder, well what's causing the shortage in blood cells? Is the bone marrow not making enough blood cells, or is the bone marrow making enough blood cells, but then the cells are being destroyed after they're released into the blood? And really, the only way to answer that question is a bone marrow aspiration. So if this is a bone over here, you could stick a needle inside the bone, and inside this cavity in the center of the bone, which is where the bone marrow is. And with this needle, you could then draw out some fluid, and then you could look at that underneath the microscope. So in leukemia, what would you expect this fluid, the bone marrow aspirate, to look like? Well, I'm gonna give you a couple of seconds to think about that while I draw the answer. So, I've drawn this diagram like 1000 times already, but I just wanted to remind you that in leukemia, your immature blood cells, your crazy leukemia cells, take over the entire bone marrow. So much so, that there's no space left inside the bone marrow. So if you took a sample of this bone marrow, it would show you two things. So the first thing that it would show you is lots and lots of cells. So an increase in the number of cells, compared to what you normally expect to see. And so we call that a hypercellular bone marrow. And hyper just means a lot, and cellular means cells, so hypercellular bone marrow means a bone marrow with lots of cells in it. And that's exactly what you get with leukemia. And the second thing that you'd expect to see is lots of immature blood cells, which are called blast cells. In a normal bone marrow, do you see immature blood cells? Well sure, because the mature blood cells have to come from somewhere. They come from the immature blood cells. But in normal bone marrow, only two to three percent of all of the cells are immature, only two to three percent. But in leukemia, the number of immature cells is greater than two to three percent. But it's not enough to say that it's just greater than two to three percent, we need to quantify how much greater it is. So in leukemia, more than 20 percent of all of the cells in the bone marrow are immature blood cells, or blast cells. So if we do a bone marrow aspiration, and we see that more than 20 percent of all of the cells that we're looking at are immature cells, are blast cells, then we know definitively that the patient has leukemia. So you figured out what's wrong with your patient, you diagnosed him with leukemia, but it's not enough to stop there, because you have to figure out what type of leukemia he has. And that's important for being able to tell him what his prognosis is, and for being able to determine what his treatment should be. So the next step would be to classify the leukemia. And this can be done in one of two ways. The first way seems the most intuitive to me. And that is to look at the leukemia cell, to characterize the leukemia cell. So I want to take you back to this diagram, which we used to talk about the development of the different types of blood cells, and you can see the mature blood cells down here. And you could tell these cells apart in a snap. They have such distinctive appearances. But these blood cells up here, the immature blood cells, these cells pretty much look exactly the same. So you can't tell them apart just by looking at them. And remember that leukemia cells are immature blood cells. So they look like these guys. So going back to our leukemia cell that we're trying to characterize, looking at the cell isn't gonna be enough. We're gonna need to do more to try to figure out what type of cell it is. So in order to find out what type of cell this is, we look at what molecules this cell has, both on the outside, and on the inside, because different blood cells express different molecules, different unique molecules that allow us to identify them. So I want to give you an example. So for example, lymphoblasts, which are immature lymphocytes, so immature B and T cells, have this protein inside their nucleii, and that protein is called TdT, and only the lymphoblasts have this protein, so the mature lymphocytes don't have this protein, and all the other types of blood cells don't have this protein. So if Joe's leukemia cell comes back positive for TdT, we know that his leukemia came from, it originated from, a lymphoblast. Another famous example is a myeloblast. Now remember that these are the immature blood cells that make the neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils. This is a myeloblast, and a myeloblast has this protein, this enzyme, in its cytoplasm that's called myeloperoxidase. And myeloperoxidase you'll often see abbreviated as MPO. And we can actually, we have a paint, we have a stain, or a paint that binds to myeloperoxidase. So we can take the leukemia cells from our bone marrow aspiration, and we can flood them in this stain, in this paint. And if the cells take up the stain, if they become colored with the stain, we know that the patient's leukemia originated from, it developed from, a myeloblast. So that's the first way that you can classify your leukemia. The second way is by looking for chromosome translocation. Now remember a chromosome translocation looks something like this. And we said that a lot of leukemias are associated with chromosome translocation. So you can look to see if your leukemia cell has a particular chromosome translocation that's associated with a particular type of leukemia, and that can help you classify the type of leukemia. And so this is how you diagnose leukemia.",science_health-and-medicine_hematologic-system-diseases-2
" In the last video we used the divergence theorem to show that the flux across this surface right now, which is equal to the divergence of f along or summed up throughout the entire region, it's equal to 0. And what I want to do in this video is think a little bit. When you get an answer like 0, you want to think about why is it? This is saying that there's no net flux across the surface right over here. Or if you sum up all of the divergences in this volume, you are getting 0. So why is that? Well, the simple way to think about it is, when we took the divergence of f, this vector field f is hard to visualize, but the divergence of f is fairly easy to visualize. The divergence is equal to 2 times x. So over here you're going to get, as you go further and further in this direction, as x becomes larger, your divergence becomes more and more positive. So you have kind of a divergence of 2 right over here. You have a divergence of 1 along that line. And you have a divergence of 0 right there. And that's also true, obviously, as you go higher. Because you're just changing the z. You're not changing the x. So all over here you have positive divergence. Over there you have positive divergence, and not just along that plane. But if you go in the x direction as well, this whole region of space, you have positive divergence, I guess you could say, in the positive x side of our octant. But then as you go on that side, on the other side, you have negative divergence. And this diagram is symmetric with respect to the zy plane. And so those divergences cancel them out. You would have had a positive flux across the surface or a positive value right over here. Instead of calculating it for this region, we had calculated for region that was just between x is 0 and 1. So let's just think about that region. So that region that would have been cut off right over here. That would have been cut off right over there. And so the back-- I guess you could say the back wall of that, the back wall of this, would have been the zy plane. Now if we care about this volume-- so we're essentially eliminating the rest of it. So let me try to eliminate it as best as I can, change the colors. So if I eliminate that part of it over there and all maybe even what we see, all of that-- I should have deleted that first. So if we eliminate the back part of it and we're just dealing with it when x is positive, then our entire solution that we did in the last video would have been the exact same, except now x is going to vary between-- instead of negative 1 and 1, it'll vary between 0 and 1. And so our bounds of integration, x is going to go between 0 and 1. And then in that situation, our final answer-- this part, this would be between 0 and 1. That would all be 0. And we would be left with 3/2 minus 1/2. 3/2 minus 1/2 is 1 minus 1/6, which is just going to be 5/6. And so when you just think about this part of it-- this side of it, this one that I've just drawn-- you had a positive flux of 5/6. On the other side you had a negative flux of 5/6. And then they canceled out. One way to interpret that is, if we thought about the entire surface, like what we saw in the last video, then you had an aggregate inward flux in the last video. That's why it was negative. And then it's completely offset by an outward flux right over here, the positive. You had a negative divergence in that other region, and you have a positive divergence that completely offsets it in this region right over here.",math_multivariable-calculus_greens-theorem-and-stokes-theorem
" To get a better intuition for the price elasticity of demand, I thought I would take a look at some of the more extreme cases and think about what types of elasticities of demand we would see. So this right over here is a vial of insulin. Many diabetics, not all diabetics, but many diabetics need to take insulin daily. They need to inject it in order to maintain their blood sugar level. If they don't do it, bad things will happen to their body. And they might even prematurely die if they don't take their insulin on time. So let's think about what the elasticity of demand might look like for something like insulin. So in one column, I'll put price. And in the other column, I will put quantity. So let's say that insulation right now is going for $5 a vial. And we have a group of diabetics who need insulin. And they're all going to buy the insulin they need. And let's say, in this group, that turns out to be 100 vials per week. So this is in vials per week. Fair enough, that's exactly what they need to do to maintain their insulin. Now, what happens if the price changes? What happens if the price were to go down? Let's say the price were to go down to $1. Well, what would the quantity be? Well, they're not going to buy any more insulin. They're going to buy just what they need in order to maintain their diabetes. And remember, we're holding all else equal. We're not assuming any change in expectations of price. They expect price go up or down or anything like that So in this case, they'll still just by 100 vials. Now, what happens if the price went up a ton? And what happens if the price went to-- what happens if we went to $100 a vial. Well, it would be hard for them. But they need it to survive. So it's going to squeeze out any other expenses that they need to spend money on. And so they still will buy 100 vials a week. And so you could keep raising price, within reason. And they would still buy the same quantity. Obviously, if you raise it to $1 billion, then they would just wouldn't be able to afford it. But within reason, they're going to buy 100 vials per week, no matter what the price is. So this is an example of perfect inelasticity. Another way, so if you think of the physical analogy that we talked about with elasticity. It's like a brick. It doesn't matter how much, within reason once again, any amount of force pulling or pushing that a human could put on a brick, it's not going to change. It's not going to deform the brick in any way. And likewise, any change in price within reason, within reason here, isn't going to change the demand in any way. It's perfectly inelastic. And if you want to do the computation, you could look at inelas-- you could figure out the demand elasticity for, let's say, when you're going from a price of $5 to $1. So the price went down by 4. And the quantity changed by 0. So your percent change in quantity, so delta percent-- I'll write it-- percent change in quantity is equal to 0. And then, your percent is going to be over your percent change in price if you use the averaging method. It was-- it would be going down by 4 over an average of 250. It'll be a fairly large number. But at 0 over anything is still going to be 0. So it doesn't matter what that thing is over here. Your elasticity of demand in this situation is 0. And if you wanted to see what this demand curve would look like, let's plot it. So this right over here is my price axis. And that is my quantity axis. And so no matter what, let's say this is a quantity of 100 of vials per week. That's true when the price is $5. So that's true in the prices $5. They're going to demand 100 vials a week. That's true when the price is $1. They're going to demand 100 vials a week. And that's true, if the price is $20 or $100 or whatever. They're going to demand 100 vials a week. And so a perfectly inelastic demand curve would look like this. It is a vertical line. It doesn't matter what price you pick. The quantity demanded is always going to be the exact same thing. Now, let's go to another extreme. So this is perfectly inelastic. You can imagine. Well, what is perfectly elastic. Something that changes a lot if you have a small percentage change in price. And to think about that, let's look at these two vending machines. And you see that they both do sell cans of Coke. That's a can of Coke there. That is can of Coke there. And let's say, starting off, the can of Coke, let's say that they cost $1 in each vending machine. And we're going to assume that this one, remember all else equal. So we're going to assume that this vending machine right over here doesn't change. Does not change. So it's just going to be consistently charging $1 for a can of Coke. And they're sitting next to each other. And it looks like they have a little coffee machine in between right over here. So let's think about the demand curve for this, for Coca Cola in this vending machine right over here. So let's think about the price and the quantity. So I'll do-- let me do price column and quantity demanded. So let's say if the price is $1. So if the price is $1, then just odds are, it's going to get about half of the sales per week. And let's say that ends up being, I don't know, let's say that ends up being 100 cans. This is in cans per week. Now what happens? And let me put some decimals here. So this is $1.00. The price is $1.00. It sells 100 cans per week. And probably this one also would also sell about 100 cans per week. Now, what happens if we have a very, very small change in price. So if we change, if we go from $1.00, instead of $1.00, we are at $0.99. What's going to happen? So this, remember, this machine right over here is not changing. This is-- we're talking-- our demand curve is for the quantity of Cokes sold from this machine. And the price was for this machine. So if this machine is even a penny cheaper. And assuming that people, there aren't lines forming and things like that, people are just always going to go to this machine. If it's easy enough, if there's no difference, they're always going to go to this machine. So this machine will be able to get, will sell all the Cokes. So it's going to sell 200 Cokes. Now, what happens if, instead of lowering the price by a penny, you raise the price by a penny. So instead of $1.00, your at $1.01. Well, now everyone's going to go to the other vending machine. They're going to say, oh, we don't-- even a penny, might as well walk to this one. Assuming everything else is equal. So then, they're going to sell 0. And so what would the demand curve look like here. Let's plot it out. So this is the price. This right over, this axis right over here is quantity. And this is in cans per week. And so this is 0. This is 100. And then, this is 200. And then this is a price of $1. That's $1. So at $1, the quantity demanded is 100 cans. Fair enough. Now, at $0.99, the quantity demanded is 200 cans. So at $0.99, the quantity demanded is 200. So $0.99 is right below that, it's 200. So it's right over there. It's like right, right, there's a little bit lower. And $1.01 a little bit over here, the quantity demanded is 0. So the demand curve here is looks something like that. So it's going to be almost horizontal. So it's going to be approaching perfect elasticity, very small changes in price end up with these huge changes, huge changes in percent quantity demanded. And I courage to work out the math to see here, that you will get a very large number for elasticity. And so something that is, this is approaching perfect elasticity. A truly perfect elasticity would be something that is a horizontal line. So in this case, so over here, our elasticity of demand-- and I'll talk about the absolute value of it, is 0. And over here, the absolute value of our elasticity of demand is infinity. '50 Because, remember, it's percent change in quantity over percent change in price. When you go from either, from one scenario to another over here, you're percent change in price is very small. It's roughly about 1% in this scenario right over here. Changing the price up or down about 1%. But then, you see your quantity is changing, depending on which one you're looking. Your quantity is changing on the order of 50% to 100%, from that 1% change in price. So you have a huge elasticity of demand here. It would be a real-- it would actually be a number. But as you can imagine, as it becomes more and more sensitive, as quantity demanded becomes more and more sensitive to a percent change in price, this curve is going to flatten out completely. And you will have an infinite, absolute value of your elasticity of demand.",economics-finance-domain_ap-microeconomics_unit-2-supply-and-demnd
" If we have some mass, m, and it is moving with some velocity, let's say the magnitude of that velocity we say is v, we know that this object right over here has momentum. Translational momentum. And that momentum, and we use the Greek letter rho to represent momentum. Translational momentum is defined as being equal to the mass times the velocity. This is all a review, we have other videos where we talk about translationial momentum, and one way to think about it is, ""Well how hard is it to stop this thing?"" Literally in everyday language you think, ""Well how much momentum does something have? ""The more momentum this has the harder it's going to, ""the harder it is to stop it in some way."" And so we know if we wanna get a little bit more mathematical, that if we wanna change momentum, we have to apply force for some amount of time. And so the magnitude of our force times the duration of the time that we apply it for, force times time and this is called impulse. And this is once again, all review. This is equal to change in momentum. Let me do this in that yellow color. That is equal to change in momentum. So if you don't have any impulse, especially if you don't have any net force acting on an object, its momentum is going to be constant. You have a conservation of momentum. And we use that idea in all sorts of interesting physics applications in the world, and especially a lot of cases using billiard balls and whatever else. So now let's try to take a similar idea, but go into the rotational world. So let's imagine you have a mass, for the sake of this we're gonna assume it's a point mass. So you have a mass there. And let's just say it's attached by, essentially a massless wire, to you know, it's just nailed down right over here. And so this right over here would be its center of rotation, and so you could imagine if someone applied a torque to this mass, this mass could start rotating in a circle. And you can just assume that maybe it's sitting on a, you know the screen, this is kind of a frictionless surface, there's no air resistance. And so then it will, if you apply a torque here, it will start rotating. And so you could think about, ""Well there might be an idea, ""just as momentum is this idea of, ""well how hard is it to stop something?"" You might say, ""Well how?"" And this is, stop translating something from moving. You might think, ""Well maybe there's a similar idea ""of how hard is it for something, ""or how hard is it to stop rotating something?"" And you could imagine that that idea has been defined and it has been defined as angular momentum. So let me make this clear, this right over here is momentum. And over here we'll talk about angular momentum. And actually both momentum and angular momentum are vector quantities. So here I just wrote kind of the magnitudes of velocity and momentum. But momentum is a vector and it could be defined, the momentum vector could be defined as equal to the mass which is a scalar quantity times the velocty. Times the velocity vector. Now the same thing is true for angular momentum, but I'm gonna stay focused on the magnitude of angular momentum. Angular momentum can have direction as you can imagine you could rotate in two different ways, but that gets a little bit more complicated when you start thinking about taking the products of vectors because as you may already know or you may see in the future, there's different ways of taking products of vectors. But just to get the intuition of angular momentum, I'll focus on the magnitudes. So angular momentum is defined and the letter used is L. I did a lot of research to try to figure out why it is called L, and I could not find a good reason. So in the message board below if anyone has a good reason I would like to know why angular momentum is called L. A lot of the best arguments I saw is that almost everything else was, all the other letters were used up for other ideas in physics. But anyway, angular momentum is defined, and it's defined very similarly. Just as kind of torque is the thing that can change how something rotates, and force is the way that something changes how something translates it, and torque is force times distance from the center of rotation, everything in kind of the rotational world is defined in a similar way. You kind of take the analogue in the translational world, and you multiply it times the distance from your center of rotation. So angular momentum is defined as mass times velocity times distance from the center of rotation so let's call this distance right over here, r. r for radius 'cause you could imagine if this was traveling in a circle that would be the radius of the circle. m, v, r. Actually let me be a little bit more careful here. It's the magnitude of the velocity that is perpendicular to the radius. Sometimes it might be called the tangential velocity. So this symbol right over here, this is the magnitude of the velocity that is perpendicular to the radius. So it would be that magnitude right over here. This is what we define as angular momentum. Now what I will tell you here is, just as in the absence of a net force, momentum is constant. We know, and I haven't shown it to you yet, I haven't proven it to you yet mathematically, but in the absence of torque, so if torque is equal to zero, we'll do torque in pink. If torque is equal to zero, if there's no net torque going on here, if the magnitude of torque is equal to zero, then we will have no change. No change in angular momentum. And we will look at that mathematically in a few seconds. But just from this there's a very interesting thing that arises. And something that you might have observed at even the Olympics or in other things. And this is the idea that you can, by changing your radius, you could actually change your tangential velocity. And as we've seen in previous videos, tangential velocity is closely related to angular velocity. So let's explore that a little bit. So when we write it in the world where, well actually you see it straight out of this, if L is constant, if r went down, so let me write this down. So let me rewrite it over here. So L, whoops. L is equal to mass times tangential velocity, or actually well yeah, tangential velocity, or the velocity that's perpendicular to the radius, times the radius. Now what happens, if we assume that this is constant, if we assume that there's no torque, so we're in this world. So this over here is going to be constant. So what happens if we were to reduce r? Somehow this wire started to reel in a little bit or started to wrap around here, and that's actually a reasonable thing, you could imagine as it rotates it starts to wrap around this thing so the wire gets shorter. So if r goes down, and this is constant, the mass isn't going to change, Well if L is constant, mass isn't changing, r is going down, tangential velocity, or the velocity that's perpendicular to the radius is going to go up. And if we wanna think about it, we can think about it in terms of angular velocity, we know that angular velocity, which we would measure in radians per second, we would use the symbol omega, omega is defined, and we go into much more depth in this in other videos, as tangential velocity, the magnitude of the velocity that is perpendicular to the radius, divided by the radius. Or if you solve for tangential velocity, you get v is equal to is equal to omega r. And so if you substitute back into this, really this definition for angular momentum, you get angular momentum is equal to mass times this times r. So mass times, I'm just substituting for velocity here, times omega r, times r. Which of course is just omega r squared. So once again we do the same exercise. If our radius goes down, what happens to our angular velocity? Remember we could measure this in angles per second or radians per second, well if this is constant, remember we're assuming that there's no net torque being applied to the system, so we're still in this world right over here. If we assume that this thing isn't changing, but the radius were to change, what's going to happen to omega? Well omega is going to go, omega is going to go up. Now likewise, if the radius got longer, 1So the radius got longer, 1what's going to happen to omega? 1Omega is going to go, 1omega is going to go down. 1So if you reduce the radius 1you're going to start spinning faster 1if you increase that radius, 1you're gonna start spinning slower. 1And you have seen this, 1or I think there's a high likelihood 1that you have seen this 1probably at the Olympics when you have seen figure skaters. 1Where they might start spinning 1and they have their arms out. 1So when their arms are out 1you could say that their radius is further out. 1And obviously a figure skater is 1a much more complex system than a point mass. 1You could imagine a figure skater is 1a bunch of point masses. 1Well you could just model a figure skater 1as a huge number of point masses 1at different radii, 1and you would wanna sum up their angular momentum, 1but the essence of what is happening is 1is when her arm is out 1the average radius when you're calculating 1all of the point masses in her arms and all the rest, 1the average radius is higher. 1And then when she pulls them in, 1when she pulls them in that radius goes down, 1and her angular velocity goes up. 1And you see that. They start spinning, 1and then without applying any torque, 1when they pull their arms in 1they start spinning faster. 1And then if they push their arms out, 1once again without applying any torque, 1they start spinning slower.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-system-of-particles-and-rotational-motion
" -  There are many videos on Khan Academy where we talk about factoring polynomials. What we're going to do in this video is do a few more examples of factoring higher degree polynomials. So let's start with a little bit of a warmup. Let's say that we wanted to factor six x squared plus nine x times x squared minus four x plus four. Pause this video and see if you can factor this into the product of even more expressions. All right, now let's do this together and the way that this might be a little bit different than what you've seen before is this is already partially factored. This polynomial, this higher degree polynomial, is already expressed as the product of two quadratic expressions but as you might be able to tell, we can factor this further. For example, six x squared plus nine x, both six x squared and nine x are divisible by three x. So let's factor out a three x here. So this is the same thing as three x times, three x times what is six x squared? Well, three times two is six and x times x is x squared and then three x times what is nine x? Well, three x times three is nine x and you can verify that if we were to distribute this three x, you would get six x squared plus nine x and then what about this second expression right over here? Can we factor this? Well, you might recognize this as a perfect square. Some of you might have said, hey, I need to come up with two numbers whose product is four and whose sum is negative four and you might say, hey, that's negative two and negative two and so this would be x minus two. We could write x minus two squared or we could write it as x minus two times x minus two. If what I just did is unfamiliar, I encourage you to go back and watch videos on factoring perfect square quadratics and things like that but there you have it. I think we have factored this as far as we can go. So now let's do a slightly trickier higher degree polynomial. So let's say we wanted to factor x to the third minus four x squared plus six x minus 24 and just like always, pause this video and see if you can have a go at it and I'll give you a little bit of a hint. You can factor in this case by grouping and in some ways it's a little bit easier than what we've done in the past. Historically, when we've learned factoring by grouping, we've looked at a quadratic and then we looked at the middle term, the x term of the quadratic and we broke it up so that we had four terms. Here, we already have four terms. See if you can have a go at that. All right, now let's do it together. So you can't always factor a third degree polynomial by grouping but sometimes you can so it's good to look for it. So when we see it written like this, we say okay, x to the third minus four x squared, is there a common factor here? Well, yeah, both x to the third and negative four x squared are divisible by x squared. So what happens if we factor out an x squared? So that's x squared times x minus four and what about these second two terms? Is there a common factor between six x and negative 24? Yeah, they're both divisible by six. So let's factor out a six here. So plus six times x minus four and now you are probably seeing the homestretch where you have something times x minus four and then something else times x minus four and so you can, sometimes I like to say undistribute the x minus four or factor out the x minus four and so this is going to be x minus four times x squared, x squared plus six and we are done.",math_algebra2_poly-factor
" -  Let's say that we have an exponential function, h of n, and since it's an exponential function it's going to be in the form a times r to the n, where a is our initial value and r is our common ratio, and we're going to assume that r is greater than zero. And they've given us some information on h of n. We know that when n is equal to 2, h of 2 is 144, that h of 4 is 324, that h of 6 is 729. So, based on the information here, let's see if we can actually figure out what a and r are going to be. And like always, pause the video and try to give it a go. All right, now let's do this together. So I'm going to focus on r first. The common ratio and if we had successive n's. If we had h of 3, then we could just find the ratio between h of 3 and h of 2 and r would just come out of that, or if the ratio between h of 4 and h of 3, we could solve explicitly for r, but we can get pretty close to that. We can just find the ratio between h of 4 and h of 2. So, h of 4, the ratio between h of 4 and h of 2 is going to be equal to, well, we know h of 4 is 324, and h of 2 is 144, and we could simplify this a little bit. Let's see, if we, if we simplify this, we would get, they're both divisible by 2. If we divide them both by 2, this one in the numerator, 324 divided by 2 is 162. 144 divided by 2 is 72. Let's see, we can divide by 2 again. 81 over 36. Divide by 2, actually, no, we can't divide by 2 anymore, but we can divide by 9 now, so 81 divided by 9 is 9, and 36 divided by 9 is 4. So this thing can be rewritten as 9/4, but we could also rewrite this ratio by using, using this form of an exponential function, so we could also say that this is going to be equal to, h of 4 is going to be a times r. Now n is 4, so r to the 4th power, and h of 2 is going to be a times r to the 2nd power. A times r to the 2nd power, and this simplifies nicely, a divided by a, cancels to just 1, and r to the 4th divided by r-squared, well that's going to be r to the 4 minus 2 power, or r, it's going to be r to the 2nd power, it's going to be r-squared, and so we have a nice little equation set up. R-squared needs to be equal to 9/4. So let me write that down. R-squared is equal to 9/4, and r needs to be greater than zero, so we could just say r is going to be the principal root of 9/4, which is equal to 3/2. So we were able to figure out r. So now how do we figure out, how do we figure out a? Well, there's a couple of ways to do it. You can think about a is going to be what h of zero is equal to, so we could do, I guess we could call it a tabular method, where, let me set up a little table here. So, a little table, so if this is n and this is h of n, so n is zero, we don't know what h of zero is just yet, it's going to be a. We don't know what h of 1 is yet. We do know that h of 2 is 144. And we do know, since the common ratio is 3/2, if we take h of 1 and we multiply it by 3/2, we're going to get h of 2, and if we take h of zero and multiply it by 3/2, we're going to get h of 1. So, h of 1 is going to be 144 divided by 3/2. So let's write that down. H of 1 is equal to 144 divided by 3/2, which is going to be 144, 144 times 2 over 3, and let's see, 144 divided by 3 is going to be equal to, is it, let's see, one 3 goes into, I'll just do this by hand, my brain doesn't work that well while I'm making videos. 3 goes into 14 four times, 4 times 3 is 12, subtract, so it's going to be, I see, it's going to be 48. 3 goes into 24 eight times. 8 times 3 is 24, you have no remainder, so, this is going to be 48 times 2, which is going to be equal to 96 so this is going to be 96, and so if we want to figure out h of zero, we just divide by 3/2 again, so, h of zero is 96 divided by 3/2 which is equal to 96 times 2 over 3. 96 divided by 3, let's see, it's going to be 32, so this is going to be 32 times, did I do that right? Yup, 32 times 2 which is equal to 64. 64. And so, just like that, we've figured out that a is equal to 64, and r, and r is equal to 3/2. So we can write h of n, we can say that h of n is equal to 64, is equal to 64 times 3/2, times 3/2, our common ratio, to the nth power. Now, there's another way that we could have tackled this instead of this tabular method. We could have just solved for a now, since we know r. We know, for example, we know for example that h of 2 which is going to be equal to a times, we know what our common ratio is, it's 3/2 to the 2nd power, is going to be equal to 144. And so, we could say a times 9 over 4 is equal to 144, and so we can multiply both sides times the reciprocal of 9 over 4, so we multiply both sides times 4 over 9, times 4 over 9, and that cancels with that, that cancels with that, and we are left with a is equal to, well let's see, 144 divided by 9 is going to be, is going to be, I want to say it's equal to 16? Is that right? I think that is right. Yup, and then 16 times 4, so this is going to be 16 and 1, 16 times 4 is 64, which is exactly what we got before, and so this actually, this method, now that I look at it, is actually a good bit easier, but they're equivalent, and I like this one because you get to see the common ratio in action, and you get to see that the initial value is the initial value. It is h of zero, but either way, once you figure out r, and you know one of the h of, you know what the function is at a value, you can solve for a, and frankly, if you knew a and you knew what the function was for a given n, you could likewise solve for r. So hopefully you enjoyed that.",math_algebra-home_alg-exp-and-log
" Plot the ordered pair 6, comma negative 8 into the coordinate plane. So this is a coordinate plane right over here. The horizontal axis here, this is the x-axis. The vertical axis here is the y-axis. And the convention, when we get an ordered pair like this, is that the first coordinate is the x-coordinate, and the second coordinate is the y-coordinate. So they're telling us that we have an x-coordinate of 6. That means we count up 6 on the x-axis. So let's count up 1. I could even write it down-- 1, and then we have 2. That's right there. Then we have 3. Then we have 4. Then we have 5. And then we've moved up 6 along the x-axis. We started at the origin, at 0, 0. That's the origin. And we moved 6 to the right. That's this part right over here. Now, our y-coordinate is negative 8. That means we move down 8 in the vertical direction. So we can see it right over here. So this right here, I'll just do that every two. So this is down 1. This right here is negative 2, negative 3. This right here is negative 4, negative 5, negative 6, negative 7, negative 8. So we move to the right 6, and then we move down 8. We move to the right 6, and then we move down 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. And we are right over there. So that is the point , 6 negative 8. You could also look at it this way. The x-coordinate is 6. So you move 6 there. And so we're going to be along this line right over here. And then you can go, and then the y-coordinate is negative 8. So you go down to negative 8. And you say, we're going to be along this line over here. And the place that they intersect is this coordinate. The easiest way I'd like to think of it, move 6 to the right, move along the x-axis, and then move along in the vertical direction along the y-axis. So you go down 8.",math_cc-sixth-grade-math_cc-6th-negative-number-topic
" We're told this table shows equivalent ratios to 24 to 40. Fill in the missing values. And they write the ratio 24 to 40 right over here. 24-- when the numerator is 24, the denominator is 40. So in that way, you could think of 24/40. But then they want us to write equivalent ratios where we have to fill in different blanks over here-- here in the denominator and here in the numerator. And there's a bunch of ways that we could actually tackle this. But maybe the easiest is to start with the ratio that they gave us, where they gave us both the numerator and the denominator, and then move from there. So for example, if we look at this one right over here, the numerator is 12. It is half of the 24. So the denominator is also going to be half of the denominator here. It's going to be half of 40. So we could stick a 20 right over there. And then we could go up here. If you compare the 3 to the 12, to go from 12 to 3, you have to divide by 4. So in the numerator, you're dividing by 4. So in the denominator, you also want to divide by 4. So 20 divided by 4 is 5. And then we have one more to fill in, this numerator right over here. And we see from the denominator, we doubled the denominator. We went from 40 to 80. So we would double the numerator as well, and so you would get 48. And what we just did here is we wrote four equivalent ratios. The ratio 3 to 5 or 3/5 is the same thing as 12 to 20, is the same thing as 24 to 40, is the same thing as 48 to 80. Let's make sure we got the right answer. Let's do a couple more of these. The following table shows equivalent fractions to 27/75. So then they wrote all of the different equivalent fractions. This table shows ratios equivalent to 18/55. Fair enough. All right, so these are all equivalent to 27/75. These are all equivalent to 18/55, so all of these. Which fraction is greater, 27/75 or 18/55? So this is an interesting thing. What we want to do-- because you look at these two things. And you're like, well, I don't know. Their denominators are different. How do I compare them? And the best way that I can think of comparing them is look at a point where you're getting an equivalent fraction. And either the numerators are going to be the same, or the denominators are going to be the same. So let's see if there's any situation here. So you have this situation where we see 27/75 is 54/150. And over here, we see that 18/55 is 54-- and this 54 jumped out at me because it's the same numerator-- over 165. And that makes the comparison much easier. What is smaller? 54/150 or 54/165? Well, if you have the same numerator, having a larger denominator will make the number smaller. So 54/165 is smaller than 54/150, which tells us that 18/55 is smaller than 27/75. So let's see, which of these? So this is saying that 27/75 is greater than 18/55, and that is absolutely right. And let's do one more of these. Lunara's friends are running a race. Each of them runs at a constant speed starting at time 0. Which of these tables might show the distances one of Lunara's friends traveled over time? So they're running a race. Each of them runs at a constant speed starting at time 0. So table 1-- so distance run in meters. So they're running at a constant speed. So really, the ratio between distance and time should be constant throughout all of these possible tables. So here you have a ratio of 3 to 2. If you triple the distance, we're tripling the time. If you multiply the distance by 5, we're multiplying the time by 5. So table 1 seems completely reasonable. Let's keep going. Table 2-- 11 to 4 and then 12 to 5. Here, it's just incrementing by 1, but the ratios are not the same. 11 to 4 is not the same thing as 12 to 5. So we're not going to be able to-- this right over here is not a legitimate table. Table 3-- so 1 to 1. Then when you double the distance, we double the time. When you triple the distance from 1, you didn't triple the time. So table 3 doesn't seem to make sense, either. Table 4-- so 14 to 10. So that's the same thing as-- let's see, that's the same ratio as, if we were to divide by 2, as 7 to 5 ratio. If we divide both of these by 3, this is also a 7 to 5 ratio. And if you divide both of these by 7, this is also a 7 to 5 ratio. So table 4 seems like a completely reasonable scenario. And we can check our answer, and it is.",math_in-in-class-7-math-india-icse_in-in-7-ratio-proportion-and-unitary-method-icse
" So the main thing I wanted to do in this video is just show you the timing of a heartbeat. And we've been drawing the left ventricular pressure. And so far, I've just sketched it out. But now, I want to try to be a little bit more careful with how I draw it so that you can get a real appreciation for how long everything seems to take. So these numbers I'm going to write up are just estimates. They're not exact numbers. And of course, you know that many things change how fast or slow a heartbeat can be. But they give you a real sense for the timing. So let's get started. The left ventricle-- it begins, we know, with a pretty low pressure. Let say this is about 50 millimeters mercury. I'm just going to estimate this is about 10. And we know that it's going to begin contracting. And I have to pick a point somewhere, so I'm just going to pick this point right here. It begins contracting at a pretty low pressure, about 10 millimeters of mercury, let's say. And right before it contracts, the last thing that happens, remember, is atrial systole. And it's a lump in the pressure. The pressure goes up, and then it slightly goes down. And that's because of the atria contracting. And before that-- I'm going backwards now, you see that? Before that, the atria and the ventricle are just slowly filling up with blood. And so the pressure's just slowly creeping up. So that's the first step in terms of what the left ventricle pressure looks like. It creeps up and then has that little bump in the end. Now, it has to go from that point to a very high point. When the ventricle contracts, it's going to skyrocket in pressure. And let's say it's going to get up to around 80 or so. And it doesn't take much time. It actually does it all in about 0.05 seconds. It just shoots up like that. So it just skyrockets up. So that's the next step. It rockets up. And really, let's talk about these two points real quickly. These points here-- let's call this B and I'll call this A. And so between A and B, what's happening exactly? Well, the big event at A is that the mitral valve closed. So I'm going to write mitral closed. And then, of course, at B, the big event is that the aortic valve opened. So I'm going to write aortic opened. And you know when I write aortic, I mean the valve, not the artery, because of course, the aorta is just an artery. It's always open. But the aortic valve opened at that point. Now, between those two-- and this is actually really a cool thing to think about-- between those two, what's going on? Well here, when the mitral valve closes to the point where the other one opens, you've got a chamber, the left ventricle, with kind of a room with two doors that are closed. There's nothing open between these two spots where I've drawn the red. And so because all of it's closed, we actually have a special name for this because there's contraction going on. The left ventricle is contracting. So we call that contraction. But because there's a room with two doors closed, the blood has nowhere to go. So the volume of blood is not going to change. It's going to be the same. And the medical word for that is ""iso."" ""Iso"" means same. So isovolumetric, same volume. So contraction. And all that means is that hey, the left ventricle's contracting. And oh, by the way, the blood volume is not changing, because there's nowhere for the blood to go. So a fancy word, but that's what it means. So now the blood is going to start entering the aorta up here. And it's going to really get a high pressure. And we know that it's going to take a little bit of time for all that blood to go into the aorta. In fact, it takes about a quarter of a second. And at the end of it, we know that the pressure is going to be somewhere around 100. It's going to be around 100, but my blood pressure is going to peak out somewhere higher than that, somewhere around 120. In fact, I know that, because whenever I go to the doctor's, they always check my blood pressure. And they tell me, hey, Rishi, your blood pressure's around 120/80. So this is helping me draw my graph. So I can say, well, I know it has to get up to about 120, because that's what my doctor told me it was. And at some point, it's going to dip down again to this point. And I'm drawing it at 100, because we know that the aortic valve is going to close at some point. And then, of course, you remember that whole dicrotic notch bit. But that's roughly what it might look like. In fact, let me actually just draw that with a yellow. And the yellow just reminds us that now, at this point, blood is entering the aorta. This whole yellow bit is blood going into the aorta. And of course, you get to another important spot here. And you remember, let's call this spot C. Here, the aortic valve closes. So this is where the valve now says, hey, enough is enough. Let's shut down, because pressure is going the other way. And then, our blood pressure is going to fall. It's going to fall, and it's going to fall over a bit of time. It's actually going to take about 0.15 seconds. And it's going to go to about, let's say-- I'm just sketching it out-- let's say about here. So about that point, let's say, and it's going to fall, fall, fall, fall, fall. And why did I choose this point? Well, that's the point where we say, well, this is where what happens? What happens at this point? The mitral valve opens. The mitral valve opens at that spot. And then, of course, the pressure continues to fall. It gets pretty low, and then eventually it has to get back up to where we started. Otherwise, the next heartbeat is not ready to go. So we have to creep our way back up as the blood fills in, and we're done. So this part right here, this third segment, where I'm going to use green, again you have the aortic valve is closed, but the mitral has not yet opened. And so does blood have anywhere to go? Nope. Again, it's stuck in a room. So if the blood is stuck in the left ventricle and the left ventricle is relaxing, then you better believe we're going to have a fancy word for it. We're going to call that relaxation. I guess not that fancy, but the first part of it is ""iso,"" same, volumetric. So same volume. Isovolumetric relaxation, and that's this part right here. Because again, the blood has nowhere to go, and the left ventricle is relaxing. And the last chunk out here, I'm going to do in a different color-- blue, let's say-- is where blood is slowly just filling back into the left atrium. And obviously, since the mitral valve is open, also the left ventricle. So these are the four segments. And you might think well, wait a second. What about that first segment? I didn't color that part in. And what I'm going to do instead is I'm going to say, well, let's say this is 0.2. So I'm going to do the same thing over here. I'm going to say what about the point 1.2? That would be equivalent. I'm going to say blood pressure keeps rising. And let's say we have our little atrial systole, something like that. So just to make it continuous instead of drawing two separate chunks, I think this will prove to you that it's basically the same thing. So this is getting ready for the next heartbeat. But in terms of time, you would agree that that's the same segment. So, then if I was actually to chunk it out, this part right here-- I'm just going to draw it on the timeline axis-- is about 0.5 seconds. I'm going to try to draw it big. I said 0.5, sorry. 0.05 seconds. My mistake, sorry. So 0.05 seconds. The next chunk, this bit right here, is about 0.25 seconds. So you could say about a quarter of a second is right there. This is about a quarter of a second. And then you've got the next chunk. This is about 0.15 seconds. And again, these numbers are not super important, but I just want you get a rough sense of simply the fact that this is actually not the same as the contraction bit. So it's a little bit longer to relax. So just get that intuitive feel for that. And then finally, this last bit. This is obviously the longest bit. This is just going on and on and on. This is going to be about-- holy cow, it's long-- 0.55 seconds. And of course, if you add up these four numbers, if you add them all up, they should add up to 1 second. Because the whole point is that this is all happening in about a second. And that's if we assume, of course, that our heart rate is 60 beats a minute. Now, that is not always true, of course. Certainly sometimes it's much faster than that. But if we assume that, just for the sake of getting a sense or a feel for this stuff, then this might be a rough estimate of how it might look. Now, one thing that I've always thought is kind of interesting. When you look at this stuff, you think, OK, well, which parts are systole and which parts are diastole? And these two, if you chunk them together, if you add them up, this makes up your systole. So that's a nice way of thinking about it. And if you then add up the rest of it, this whole bit 1right here, this is your diastole. 1And you remember, we have talked about how 1the fact that diastole is about 2/3 of the time and systole 1is about 1/3 of the time. 1And you can see how that's basically true here. 1And now, the final thing-- this is actually 1something that always threw me off, 1confused me a little bit-- is this chunk right here. 1I've always wondered why this isn't part of systole. 1It certainly looks like it's part 1of the lump, or the big mountain drawing. 1But the truth is that we have to remember 1that the left ventricle is relaxing during this time. 1And diastole is all about relaxation 1for the left ventricle. 1So because it's part of relaxation, 1it is technically and truthfully part of diastole, 1even though it looks like it's part of the lump. 1So just keep that in mind.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system
" -  Today we're gonna talk about the sign convention for passive components. It's a big mouthful, but it's a fairly simple idea. Well first of all, let's look at this word passive. Passive is the way we describe components that do not create power or components that do not amplify signals. So particularly resistors, as we have one here. Does not amplify a signal. Capacitors and inductors do not either. So all three of those are passive components. And sometimes we say something like a battery or a voltage source is a passive component because it can't amplify a signal. It does provide power, but it does not make signals bigger, it can't make a voltage larger than it already is. So we're gonna start with the way to label this resistor with its current and voltage. First we'll resort to Ohm's law, our friend, voltage equals current, which is i times r, and when we label this, when we label this device, here's a resistor, so we'll give that a label, and we're gonna put a voltage across this, something outside of this is gonna put a voltage across it and this end will be positive with respect to this end. And the question is, the question we want to answer is which direction does the current go? When the positive voltage is here and the negative voltage is here, which way's the current flow through this resistor? Does it go from top to bottom, or bottom to top? The answer is the positive current goes this way, it goes down, so that's i in this. And the current is going into the end with the positive sign on the voltage. Now I'm gonna draw another one of these, same sort of thing, and we'll do it a different way. We'll do this one sideways. And I'll label the voltage, here's r, and I'll put a voltage on it, and the voltage let's label it this way, we label the plus end this way and label the minus end this way. The question is which way does the current go? Well the current goes in the positive end so it goes in that way. And that's the sign convention for passive components. The current goes into the voltage on the positive terminal or the voltage. If I drew the arrow over here like this, that would still mean the same thing, it's still going in the positive and coming out the negative side. So when we draw this for capacitors and inductors, let's draw a capacitor over here, and there's c, and if I labeled this with a voltage, plus and minus v, then the passive sign convention tells me that I label the positive current going in, i. The same for an inductor. We'll draw a curly inductor, like that, we'll put a voltage on it this time. I'll put the voltage on this side, plus, minus v, this is our inductor, like that, and the current, the current goes in the top like that. So it goes in the same side as the plus. And the current comes out on the minus side. You can draw it either way you want. Let's practice some more, this time we'll do it with a resistor, again. Here's another resistor, and this time I'm gonna label the current first. I'm gonna say the current goes this way through the resistor. And now, using the passive component sign convention, how do we label the voltage? I wanna label the voltage. Where's the plus sign? Plus sign is on the side that the current goes in. The current's going in to this terminal, so that is the plus side of the resistor. And that's basically the idea of a sign convention for passive components. When we're setting up a circuit, if we have a complicated circuit, we're setting it up, we have to give names to all the voltages and all the currents. And this is the way you do it to make sure that Ohm's law comes out with the correct sign. That's why we have this sign convention.",science_electrical-engineering_ee-circuit-analysis-topic
" In this video, I want to talk about how we can convert repeating decimals into fractions. So let's give ourselves a repeating decimal. So let's say I had the repeating decimal 0.7. And sometimes it'll be written like that, which just means that the 7 keeps on repeating. So this is the same thing as 0.7777 and I could just keep going on and on and on forever with those 7s. So the trick to converting these things into fractions is to essentially set this equal to a variable. And we'll just show it, do it step-by-step. So let me set this equal to a variable. Let me call this x. So x is equal to 0.7, and then the 7 repeats on and on forever. Now what would 10x be? Well, let's think about this. 10x. 10x would just be 10 times this. And we could even think of it right over here. It would be, if we multiplied this times 10, you'd be moving the decimal 1 over to the right, it would be 7.777, on and on and on and on forever. Or you could say it is 7.7 repeating. Now this is the trick here. So let me make these equal to each other. So we know what x is. x is this, just 0.777 repeating forever. 10x is this. And this is another repeating thing. Now the way that we can get rid of the repeating decimals is if we subtract x from 10x. Right? Because x has all these 0.7777. If you subtract that from 7.77777, then you're just going to be left with 7. So let's do that. So let me rewrite it here just so it's a little bit neater. 10x is equal to 7.7 repeating, which is equal to 7.777 on and on forever. And we established earlier that x is equal to 0.7 repeating, which is equal to 0.777 on and on and on forever. Now what happens if you subtract x from 10x? So we're going to subtract the yellow from the green. Well, 10 of something minus 1 of something is just going to be 9 of that something. And then that's going to be equal to, what's 7.7777 repeating minus 0.77777 going on and on forever repeating? Well it's just going to be 7. These parts are going to cancel out. You're just left with 7. Or you could say these two parts cancel out. You're just left with 7. And so you get 9x is equal to 7. To solve for x, you just divide both sides by 9. Let's divide both sides by nine. I could do all three sides, although these are really saying the same thing. And you get x is equal to 7/9. Let's do another one. I'll leave this one here so you can refer to it. So let's say I have the number 1.2 repeating. So this is the same thing as 1.2222 on and on and on. Whatever the bar is on top of, that's the part that repeats on and on forever. So just like we did over here, let's set this equal to x. And then let's say 10x. Let's multiply this by 10. So 10x is equal to, it would be 12.2 repeating, which is the same thing as 12.222 on and on and on and on. And then we can subtract x from 10x. And you don't have to rewrite it, but I'll rewrite it here just so we don't get confused. So we have x is equal to 1.2 repeating. And so if we subtract x from 10x, what do we get? On the left-hand side, we get 10x minus x is 9x. And this is going to be equal to, well, the 2 repeating parts cancel out. This cancels with that. If 2 repeating minus 2 repeating, that's just a bunch of 0. So it's 12 minus 1 is 11. And you have 9x is equal to 11. Divide both sides by 9. You get x is equal to 11/9.",math_8th-engage-ny_engage-8th-module-7
" -  Let's say we have a concave mirror of focal length two centimeters, and in front of it, we're gonna keep an object, and let's say that the object is kept six centimeters in front of that mirror. Where will its image be? In this video, we're gonna find out exactly where that image would be. All right, now, in some of our previous videos, we actually discussed about this. We've seen that there are a couple of ways you can solve this. One way would be to actually, you know, draw this on a piece of paper and then use your ruler to figure out exactly, by drawing real diagrams, figure out exactly where the image is going to be. But if we don't wanna do all those drawings, then another method would be to build a master formula, a master formula which connects the object distance, the focal length, and the image distance, and the one which will work for all cases, for concave and convex mirrors, and we can just substitute in that and get our answer. So in this video, we're not going to build the master formula. If you are interested in figuring out how to derive that master formula, there a bonus video, and you can just go there and watch that. But we will see what that master formula is, we'll understand it, and then we'll use it to solve the problem, all right? So that one formula, which is going to help us figure out solve problems like this, that formula looks like this, and it's called the mirror formula, for obvious reason, because it works for mirrors. And let's see what these things are. There are three things you can see. F stands for the focal length, so that's something we already know. V is the image, image distance, so this is image distance, and that's something we don't know in this problem. And u is the object distance, these are the letters that we usually use for mirrors, object distance. And one super important thing to remember is that this is a sign-sensitive formula, which means when we're substituting the numbers into it, we need to take care of their signs, they can positive values and negative values, and to quickly recall why we do that, that's because we didn't differentiate between measurements done in front of the mirror and measurements done behind the mirror. We assign one of those measurements as positive, the other measurement is a negative. And do to quickly recall how we figure that out, which is positive and which is negative, we always choose the incident direction as positive. So notice that here is the object and here is the mirror, and the incident ray would be this way. So incident direction, right side is positive. This means that all the positions to the right side of the mirror will be positive positions. Anything on the right side of the mirror will be positive, and anything to the left of the mirror will be negative positions. And if this thing is not super clear to you, then it would be great to pause this video and go back to previous videos, where we've discussed this in great detail. Watch that and then come back over here. All right, now that we have all our signs ready, let's look at what we have. We need to find the image distance, that's what we need to figure out, so this is what we need. What do we know? We know the object distance, that is six centimeters, object is six centimeters from the mirror, and so u is six centimeters, but remember, we need to take care of the signs. Notice that the object lies on the negative side because all the positions here are negative. So u will be minus six centimeters. Then, what else do we need, we need focal length. We can see the focal length, the principal focus also lies on the negative side, and therefore, this focal length will be negative two centimeters. Hope that is clear. Anything that lies on the negative side will get negative distances. All right, okay, so we have two things, f and u, and we need to figure out what v is. And so now, then, whatever follows is just going to be substitution and algebra. So, great idea to pause the video and see if you can do the algebra yourself. Now, before you pause, a quick thing. I want to emphasize on what these negative signs mean in this particular example. So once we have these sign conventions, when we substitute the negative six over here, we're telling the formula that the object lies on the negative side, which means in front of the mirror. If we had substituted plus six by mistake, then the formula will assume that the object lies on this side, which is behind the mirror, and I know that sounds silly, but that's what the formula would assume, and then we'll probably get the wrong answer. Similarly, when we substitute the negative two centimeters over, we're telling the formula that we're dealing with a concave mirror. How, because only if it is a concave mirror, the focal point will lie on the negative side, as is in this example. And if we had substituted plus two centimeters over here, then it would assume that the focal point is on this side, meaning it would assume it's a convex mirror, again, it would give us a wrong answer. Just telling you how important it is to include proper signs in our formula. All right, pause and try to do the algebra yourself now. All right, let's do this. So if we substitute, we'll get one over f, which is negative two, that will equal one over v plus one over u, which is negative six. Now, I'm not gonna substitute the centimeters because everything is in centimeters, so my image distance will also be in centimeters. I like to put the negative side, negative sign on the numerator, so call this minus 1/2 equals one over v, negative times positive is negative, so minus one over six, excellent. Now, I need to isolate one over v because that's what I want to figure out, so I'm gonna try to get rid of this negative one over six, by adding one over six on both sides. So if we add one over six on both sides, on the left-hand side, we're adding one over six, we will also add one over six on the right-hand side, and when we do that, that'll cancel with this one or negative one over six. And so, we then operate one over v. Okay, so let's solve this. We have to add two fractions. We're gonna make the common denominator, two and six, our cm is six. And so I'm gonna multiply this by three, multiply this by three, it'll get negative three plus one, plus one, that's gonna be negative two, so we can just write that down somewhere. Okay, minus two over six, and that's one over v. And it's getting a little crowded, but you know, it's almost done, minus, we can just cancel this, two goes one times, two goes three times. and so, we have one over v equals negative one over three, so we want v, so we'll do the reciprocal, v will be negative reciprocal of this one, one over three reciprocal is three, as we get negative three centimeters. And there we have it, we have found what v is. So what this means is that the image is three centimeters away from the port, from the center of this mirror. Remember, whenever we are using this formula, all the distances are from the port. So, three centimeters, but which side? Well, the sign tells me it's on the negative side, and so, I know it's in front of the mirror. So it would be somewhere over here because this is two, it's a given, so this would be somewhere over here, three centimeters. And there we have it, we have solved our problem. So, to quickly summarize, we learned what the mirror formula is, which connects focal length, object distance, and image distance, and to use this formula, we have to use our sign conventions, and the sign convention that we use is we consider the incident direction is positive and then the other direction becomes negative. Now, before we wind up, one thing I need to mention is something that we should always remember is that a sign convention that we're using is just a standard. If you ever forget that, don't worry, you will still get the right answer, so what I mean is if, by mistake, when you're solving this problem, if you chose the left side as positive, and the right side as negative, but you substituted your values accordingly, then you would still get the right answer. You would eventually get that the image is three centimeters in front of the mirror. But usually, we like to choose the incident direction as positive, and we like to stick to this sign convention.",science_in-in-class10th-physics_in-in-10th-physics-light-reflection-refraction
" - When we observe what we call fire we have this combustion reaction going on and then we see these flames what we're really observing are the three forms of thermal energy transfer. We're observing conduction, conduction, convection, convection, convection, and thermal radiation all at the same time. So I'll do this, thermal, thermal radiation, thermal radiation. And I could say thermal conduction, thermal convection, and thermal radiation, and the word thermal is just relating to things dealing with temperature. So what is the conduction going on? Well what we have going on in the fuel for our fire, so down here the fuel for our fire we have our classic combustion reaction and I encourage you to watch the video on that in our chemistry playlist, or chemistry section if you're interested in it. But you're taking carbon molecules and their bonds and then in the presence of oxygen and some heat you have a combustion reaction producing carbon dioxide and producing water and even more energy than you put into it, so it's producing a lot of energy. And that energy is going to excite the molecules that are around it, so you have these molecules, you have these molecules that end up getting a lot of kinetic energy. And remember, temperature is proportional to average kinetic energy. And so the ones that just combusted, or the molecules right near the reaction, or maybe the ones that were part of the reaction, they're gonna have this really high, they're gonna have this really high average kinetic energy 'cause all of this energy was released from that combustion reaction. And then they're going to bump into other molecules that might not have quite as high kinetic energy, but then they're going to transfer that kinetic energy through these collisions. And we have a whole video on thermal conduction, but that's what's happening. Things with higher kinetic energy are bumping into things with lower kinetic energy and transferring some of that kinetic energy and they're transferring some of that momentum. So that is definitely happening when we look at a fire like this, that neighboring molecules are bumping into other molecules and transferring energy. Now convection, this is around the idea that hot air is less dense. So if we have a bunch of air particles here, so let's say this is the cool air up here, and it makes sense why cool air is going to be more dense than hot air. 'Cause hot air, these particles have a much higher kinetic energy and so they're gonna bump into each other and they're gonna push each other much further away and get more seperation from each other because of that high average kinetic energy. But because the hot area is less dense, this area right over here is less dense, less dense, than the white area, these might be all the same molecule, I just made them in different colors to show the less dense area and the more dense area, it is going to rise, it is going to rise. Or you can even think of it as a more dense area. The more dense area is gonna fall around it, it's gonna fall around it, or try to go under it, because it is more dense, and then the less dense area is going to rise. And by doing that, you have the hotter molecules are moving upwards and then the cold molecules can go down to maybe the source of heat, the source of heat, the source of energy right over here to get heated up more. So this right over here is, so hot air rises, let me write this, the hot, hot air rises. And when we think about it it makes room for the cool air to come down and then get heated up again. And that's what's going on in the fire here. You see the combustion reaction, combustion reaction occurs right over there, let me just hit a different color, combustion reaction is occurring in the fuel, that super hot air, it's going to rise. And that's why it looks like these flames are kind of, they're moving upwards, they're kind of flickering upwards. And you'll also see, and actually we're gonna talk about this in thermal radiation, is that they also change color as they move upwards. But this whole idea of fire moving upwards and the hot air, if you put your hand up here it's gonna be much hotter than if you were to put your hand, say, right here, even though in theory this is closer to the flame than up here and that's because the hot air, the hot air is rising and it's making room for cold air, or cooler air, I guess I could say, to come down here and be part and get heated up again, and then it would rise up again. And so this convection, this idea of the hot air rising or the cold air falling, this is another form of heat transfer. Now the last form that we're observing when we're looking at fire is thermal radiation. And this is all around the idea that if you have charged particles being accelerated they're going to release electromagnetic radiation. And so you might say, Wait, wait, charged particles, where are those being accelerated here? Well, we have these molecules that are constantly being accelerated as they bump into each other, the one that's gonna transfer kinetic energy from, let's say this one bumps into that, it's going to accelerate that in different direction and even this one might go in another direction and acceleration is a change in velocity so it could be the magnitudinal velocity or your directional velocity. So as they're colliding you have all of these accelerational charged particles, so let me write this down, you have acceleration, acceleration of charged particles, charged particles, particles, and then that releases, that releases, electromagnetic radiation, that releases electromagnetic radiation. I know what you're thinking, Wait wait, hold on a second, Sal. Okay, I can buy that we have molecules that are being accelerated, but where is this charged, where are you getting this charged particles business? Well we have to remember these molecules are made up of atoms and atoms are made up of charged particles, are made up of protons and electrons. And so as you accelerate these and the more that you accelerate these the more radiation you are going to release. And you might say, Okay, you said I'm observing that in fire, where am I observing radiation? Well just the very fact that you can see the fire, the light emitted from the fire, that is electromagnetic radiation, that is electromagnetic radiation. It's just the electromagnetic radiation in the wavelengths that your eye considers to be visible light, or that your eye considers to be light. Even the particles up here, so even the particles up here that are still quite hot, they are also emitting electromagnetic radiation because they're all bumping into each other and their electrons and their protons are all getting accelerated in different ways, they're also releasing electromagnetic radiation, but it is at a slower wavelength than your eye is capable of perceiving as light. If you had an infrared camera you would see the flames being much larger. You would see them go all the way, all the way up here. And if you were to look at the flame closely you would see down here right where the combustion reaction is happening, the flame looks blue. And that's because the blue light is higher energy light, and that's because the particles are being accelerated more down here, and then it goes from blue to kind of a white to a yellow, to a red or to an orange, to a red, and then it, to your regular eyes, it disappears. But everything, everything that has some temperature is releasing electromagnetic radiation. And you're like, Okay, well that's all fine, I can see it but how is that a form of energy transfer? Well, if you're ever sat next to a flame you will feel the heat. In fact, even if the air between you and the flame is cold you would still feel like you're getting warm. So if this is a flame right over here, so that is fire, and let's say you have cold air, cold air, let's say you're at a campfire right over here, maybe it's 30, this air right over here is 30 degrees, if you are standing right over here you would still feel heat, you would still feel like you're getting warmed up. And that's because that electromagnetic radiation is being emitted from the air particles that we perceive as fire and then that can actually excite particles on your skin and it will transfer energy to your skin and so you feel like you are actually getting warmed up. I remember once, this is kind of a strange story, but I was on the highway and there was a car on fire and I was literally, we drove to the far lane because it was on fire, we're three lanes away from it and it kind of exploded. I don't think anyone was in it, hopefully no one was in it, but I remember right when it exploded it was an intense, immediate heat that we felt through the window of the car, and that was electromagnetic radiation. That was thermal radiation being released by these accelerated particles in the air around that explosion, which we perceived as a an explosion, or fire, but then it was warming up particles on my skin.",science_ap-physics-2_ap-thermodynamics
" There are other, higher levels of regulation that occur here and I started to talk about them when I mentioned our RB protein. So, control of the cell cycle occurs on a higher level with a couple of key proteins in addition to RB. One of the main proteins we talk about that regulate on a very high level is p53. It's even got a nickname: it's the ""guardian of the genome."" It's so important, actually, that Science Magazine called it, ""the molecule of the year"" in 1993. Theobromine, the main molecule that's in chocolate, hasn't even gotten this honor yet. So it shows you how important p53 is. It's more important than chocolate. P53 will bind DNA directly to produce proteins that block the progression of the cell cycle. One of those proteins include p21. P21 will function to inhibit CDK. So the CDK will not be able to activate DNA replication or activate mitosis. RB is another protein that is associated with the function of P53, and these proteins are considered tumor suppressor genes, so RB is a protein that is produced from a tumor suppressor gene, just like p53, so I'll write that down here. These proteins are considered tumor suppressor genes... They're made from tumor suppressor genes I should rather say. These proteins are made from tumor suppressor genes, which are important to have because if they are defected, or if they have a mutation in them that makes them have loss of function, so that's an important term, (repeats) defected or if they have a loss of function, what ends up happening is that you tend to get cancer. Cancer, which I think you and I can both agree is not a good thing to have. So, it is very important to have tumor suppressor genes. To illustrate how important that is, if you look at p53, greater than 50% of tumors have a defect in p53. RB got its name because a defect in RB would lead to a tumor of the eye, known as retino-that's where you got the R- retinoblastoma, which is why these two proteins are considered tumor suppressor genes. P21 is very unusual in that it doesn't actually lead to cancer when it's defected. Instead, scientists have found that mice that are without p21 have the ability to regenerate their limbs. How weird is that?! P21 lack causes the ability to regenerate their limbs, their arms and legs. So we're all still trying to figure out exactly how some of these key proteins work. But it's important to understand that these tumor suppressor genes are essential for making sure that we regulate the cell cycle so we don't just go to the divide, divide, divide phase. We want to make sure that we only divide when it's appropriate, when a cell is ready to, or if it's even a cell that is supposed to divide in the first place. Because, as we'll see in our next couple of videos, mitosis, or cell division, requires a lot of energy and protein machinery to happen. So we need to make sure it's the right time to divide.",science_ap-biology_cell-communication-and-cell-cycle
" A lot of what you'll learn in differential equations is really just different bags of tricks. And in this video I'll show you one of those tricks. And it's useful beyond this. Because it's always good when, if maybe one day, you become a mathematician or a physicist, and you have an unsolved problem. Some of these tricks that solved simpler problems back in your education might be a useful trick that solves some unsolved problems. So it's good to see it. And if you're taking differential equations, it might be on an exam. So it's good to learn. So we'll learn about integrating factors. So let's say, we have an equation that has this form. Let's say this is my differential equation. 3xy-- I'm trying to write it neatly as possible-- plus y squared plus x squared plus xy times y prime is equal to 0. So, especially since we've covered this in recent videos, whenever you see an equation of this form where you have some function of xy, then you have another function of x and y times y prime equals 0, you said, oh, this looks like this could be an exact differential equation. And how do we test that? Well, we can take the partial derivative of this with respect to y, and we could call this function of x and y, M. So the partial of that, with respect to y, so M partial with respect to y, would be 3x plus 2y. And if this function right here, that expression right there, that's our function N, which is a function of x and y. We take the partial with respect to x, and we get that is equal to 2x plus y. And in order for this to have been an exact differential equation, the partial of this with respect to y would have to equal the partial of this with respect to x. But we see here, just by looking at these two, they don't equal each other. They're not equal. So, at least superficially, the way we looked at it just now, this is not an exact differential equation. But what if there were some factor, or I guess some function that we could multiply both sides of this equation by, that would make it an exact differential equation? So let's call that mu. So what I want to do is I want to multiply both sides of this equation by some function mu, and then see if I can solve for that function mu that would make it exact. So let's try to do that. So let's multiply both sides by mu. And just as a simplification, mu could be a function of x and y. It could be a function of x. It could be a function of just x. It could be function of just y. I'll assume it's just a function of x. You could assume it's just a function of y and try to solve it. Or you could just assume it's a function of x and y. If you assume it's a function of x and y, it becomes a lot harder to solve for. But that doesn't mean that there isn't one. So let's say that mu is a function of x. And I want to multiply it by both of these equations. So I get mu of x times 3xy plus y squared plus mu of x times x squared plus xy times y prime. And then, what's 0 times any function? Well, it's just going to be 0, right? 0 times mu of x is just going to be 0. But I did multiply the right hand side times mu of x. And remember what we're doing. This mu of x is-- when we multiply it, the goal is, after multiplying both sides of the equation by it, we should have an exact equation. So now, if we consider this whole thing our new M, the partial derivative of this with respect to y should be equal to the partial derivative of this with respect to x. So what's the partial derivative of this with respect to y? Well, if we're taking the partial with respect to y here, mu of x, which is only a function of x, it's not a function of y, it's just a constant term, right? We take a partial with respect to y. x is just a constant, or a function of x can be viewed just as a constant. So the partial of this with respect to y is going to be equal to mu of x, you could just say, times 3x plus 2y. That's the partial of this with respect to y. And what's the partial of this with respect to x? Well, here, we'll use the product rule. So we'll take the derivative of the first expression with respect to x. mu of x is no longer a constant anymore, since we're taking the partial with respect to x. So the derivative of mu of x with respect to x. Well, that's just mu prime of x, mu prime, not U. mu prime of x. mu is the Greek letter. It's for the muh sound, but it looks a lot like a U. So mu prime of x times a second expression, x squared plus xy, plus just the first expression. This is just the product rule, mu of x. Times the derivative of the second expression with respect to x. So times-- ran out of space on that line-- 2x plus y. And now for this new equation, where I multiplied both sides by mu. In order for this to be exact, these two things have to be equal to each other. So let's just remember the big picture. We're kind of saying, this is going to be exact. And now, we're going to try to solve for mu. So let's see if we can do that. So let's see, on this side, we have mu of x times 3x plus 2y. And let's subtract this expression from both sides. So it's minus mu of x times 2x plus y. You'll see a lot of these differential equation problems that get kind of hairy. They're really just a lot of algebra. And that equals-- what do we have left? I'll write it in yellow. That equals-- I'm going to run out of space. I'm going to do it a little bit lower. That equals, just this term right here. That equals mu prime of x times x squared plus xy. And let's see, if we factor out a mu of x here, we get mu of x times 3x plus 2y minus 2x minus y is equal to mu prime of x, the derivative of mu with respect to x, times x squared plus xy. Now, we can simplify this. So we get mu of x times-- what is this-- 3x minus 2x is x. 2y minus y, so x plus y, is equal to-- and I'm just going to simplify this side a little bit-- is equal to mu prime of x. Let's factor out an x here. And the reason why I'm doing that is because it seems like if I factor out an x here, I'll get an x plus y. So this is mu prime of x times x times x plus y. x times x plus y is x squared plus xy. So that's why I did it, and I have this x plus y on both sides equation, which I will now divide both sides by. So if you divide both sides by x plus y, we could maybe assume that it's not 0. That simplifies things pretty dramatically. We get mu of x is equal to mu prime of x times x. And now, just the way my brain works, I like to rewrite this expression just in our operator form, where instead of writing it mu prime of x, we could write that as d mu dx. So let's do that. So we could write mu of x is equal to d, the derivative of mu with respect to x, times x. And this is actually a separable differential equation in and of itself. It's kind of a sub-differential equation to solve our broader one. We're just trying to figure out the integrating factor right here. So let's divide both sides by x. So we get mu over x, this is just a separable equation now, is equal to d mu dx. And then, let's divide both sides by mu of x, and we get 1 over x is equal to 1 over mu. That's mu of x, I'll just write 1 over mu right now, for simplicity, times d mu dx. I'm actually going to go horizontal right here. Multiply both sides by dx, you get 1 over x dx is equal to 1 over mu of x d mu. Now, you could integrate both sides of this, and you'll get the natural log of the absolute value of x is equal to the natural log of the absolute value of mu, et cetera, et cetera. But it should be pretty clear from this that x is equal to mu, or mu is equal to x, right? They're identical. If you look at both sides of this equation there, you can just change x for mu, and it becomes the other side. So, this is obviously telling us that mu of x is equal to x. Or mu is equal to x. So we have our integrating factor. And if you want, you can take the antiderivative of both sides with the natural logs, and all of that. And you'll get the same answer. But this is just, by looking at it, by inspection, you know that mu is equal to x. Because both sides of this equation are completely the same. 1Anyway, we now have our integrating factor. 1But I am running out of time. 1So in the next video, we're now going to use this 1integrating factor. 1Multiply it times our original differential equation. 1Make it exact. 1And then solve it as an exact equation. 1I'll see you in the next video.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-differential-equations
" Shira's math test included a survey question asking how many hours students had spent studying for the test. The graph below shows the relationship between how many hours students spent studying and their score on the test. Shira drew the line below to show the trend in the data. Assuming the line is correct, what does the line slope of 15 mean? So let's see. The horizontal axis is time studying in hours. The vertical axis is scores on the test. And each of these blue dots represent the time and the score for a given student. So this student right over here spent-- I don't know, it looks like they spend about 0.6 hours studying. And they didn't do too well on the exam. They look like they got below a 45, looks like a 43 or a 44 on the exam. This student over here spent almost 4 and 1/2 hours studying and got, looks like, a 94, close to a 95 on the exam. And what Shira did is try to draw a line that tries to fit this data. And it seems like it does a pretty good job of at least showing the trend in the data. Now, slope of 15 means that if I'm on the line-- so let's say I'm here-- and if I increase in the horizontal direction by 1-- so there, I increase the horizontal direction by 1-- I should be increasing in the vertical direction by 15. And you see that. If we increase by one hour here, we increase by 15% on the test. Now, what that means is that the trend it shows is that, in general, along this trend, if someone studies an extra hour, then if we're going with that trend, then, hey, it seems reasonable that they might expect to see a 15% gain on their test. Now, let's see which of these are consistent. In general, students who didn't study at all got scores of about 15 on the test. Well, let's see. This is neither true-- these are the people who didn't study at all, and they didn't get a 15 on the test. And that's definitely not what this 15 implies. This doesn't say what the people who didn't study at all get. So this one is not true. That one is not true. Let's try this one. If one student studied for one hour more than another student, the student who studied more got exactly 15 more points on the test. Well, this is getting closer to the spirit of what the slope means. But this word ""exactly"" is what, at least in my mind, messes this choice up. Because this isn't saying that it's a guarantee that if you study an hour extra that you'll get 15% more on the test. This is just saying that this is the general trend that this line is seeing. So it's not guaranteed. For example, we could find this student here who studied exactly two hours. And if we look at the students who studied for three hours, well, there's no one exactly at three hours. But some of them-- so this was, let's see, the student who was at two hours. You go to three hours, there's no one exactly there. But there's going to be students who got better than what would be expected and students who might get a little bit worse. Notice, there's points above the trend line, and there's points below the trend line. So this ""exactly,"" you can't say it's guaranteed an hour more turns into 15%. Let's try this choice. In general, studying for one extra hour was associated with a 15-point improvement in test score. That feels about right. In general, studying for 15 extra hours was associated with a 1-point improvement in test score. Well, no, that would get the slope the other way around. So that's definitely not the case. So let's check our answer. And we got it right.",math_statistics-probability_describing-relationships-quantitative-data
" -  We've done many videos on Khan Academy on evolution and natural selection explaining them, but I thought I would do a video going a little bit more in depth in evidence for evolution and natural selection. And I started with this quote ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution."" This is by Theodus Dobzhansky, who's a famous biologist, he's passed away now, and what he's saying is absolutely true and this is why it's so important to appreciate the evidence for evolution and natural selection and to understand them, because before the theory of evolution, biology was just about observation and classification without having a cohesive narrative for how all of this came about. And since Darwin had come up with this theory in the mid-19th century, we've had far more tools to back it up beyond just the observations we had up until that point. We have our tools around dating and the fossil record, which gives us much more evidence. We have our tools of microbiology and genetics, which gives us even stronger evidence, so a lot of times people say ""Oh, it's a theory, evolution ""is it just a theory?"" Well, it's about as strong as theories get and without it, as Theodus Dobzhansky said, biology as we know it and all of the progress we've made in biology frankly wouldn't make any sense and probably would not have happened. Now I'm going to broadly go into three types of evidence in this video for evolution and natural selection. The first is structural. And these are the types of things that folks like Darwin would have observed, that people have been observing in biology for a long time but evolution and natural selection starts to make a lot more sense of it, and here we're talking about the macro structure, things that we can for the most part observe with our eyes or with a very simple microscope. The next level is what we've learned, really over the last 100 or so years, at the micro level, in microbiology. Microbiology and especially in genetics. So this has really firmed up the theory of evolution. And then the last dimension we'll look at is direct observation, direct observation, and this is really where it goes beyond a theory. We are seeing it happen. A lot of times people say ""Oh, it's a theory, ""you know, the theory says it happened over tens ""of millions of years but no one was around to really ""observe, even if we see a lot of evidence, no one ""knows if it for sure happened."" But if you're directly observing things, well you know it's for sure happening and as we'll see, evolution does not only occur over time scales of millions or tens of millions of years, it actually can occur and we see it occurring all the time on scales well within a human observational capacity, within just a matter of months or years. So let's go through each of these. So first let's talk about structural and this is a very high-level overview. I encourage you to do more research on it. You will find loads and loads and loads of any type of this evidence. So the first thing I want to talk about is homologous structures, homologous structures, that you see throughout the biological world. Hom-ol-o-gous, homologous structures. And the word homologous means things that have similar structure, similar position, similar ancestry but not necessarily the exact same function. And here you see examples of a, well as a human, we would consider a forearm. You see the human forearm and wrist and then you see the homologous structures in dogs and birds and whales. And even though this part of those animals have very different functions, a human does not walk on its hands for the most part; a dog does walk on its front legs; a bird isn't walking at all, it's using them to flap its wings; and a whale, this is making up its actual fins, it's using them to propel or to control their movement inside of the water. And even though they have these very, very different functions and at first when you look at a human and a bird and a whale on the outside, they might look reasonably different, when you look at these bone structures, they are eerily similar, especially color-coded the way it is. So these are, this is a very strong hint that maybe humans, dogs, birds, and whales share a common ancestor, more recently in the past than say other animals or organisms, I should say, that don't have, whose structures aren't as homologous as these are right over here. And if you were independently trying to create structures for what each of these different species are doing, it's not obvious that you would have such homologous structures actually be involved. Now these are all species that exist today, these are all species that exist on the planet at the same time, but we also see structural evidence by going into the fossil record. In the last few hundred years, or early in the last hundred years is where we've gotten really good at it, we've gotten good at looking at different layers of rock strata and being able to date them and say ""Okay, that layer was laid down x-million ""years ago, that layer was laid down a little bit ""more recent, this one was even more recent,"" and then looking at fossils within that to say ""Okay, 20 million years ago there were species ""around that looked something like that, ""and then 10 million years ago there were species ""that looked like that."" And one example is if you look at a horse-like animal. So this is right over here, we're talking about horses, zebras, donkeys, mules, things like that, the modern ones, well this is their bone structure but if you look at the fossil record from 12 to 5 million years ago, you see fossils that look like this and they're very close so you see, it's very believable that you could have evolution from this to that, but then you go further back and once again, it draws, it seems like a very gradual process. And once again, this happening over, these are from 12 to 5 million years ago, these are from 16 to 12 million years ago, these are from over 34 million years ago. And so you can see how this is happening at a very, very gradual pace and the mechanism, and we go into some depth in other videos in Khan Academy, you have variation in species, you have the environment selecting for it. The environment might change or different things happen so you have different forms of selection, different types of combinations sprout up, they're more suitable for the environment, they start to reproduce better, they become the domit species or they take over certain parts of a niche or an ecosystem, and so you have this change, this heritable change of traits over time. And so when you look at the fossil record, it makes a lot of sense that, okay, this is strong evidence for evolution, that the animals that we see today weren't just put on, just created all of a sudden and haven't changed since then, but there's a constant change and we can see it directly through the fossil record. Now the next point of evidence, I will put a bit of a caveat because the gentleman who first created this, his name was Haeckel, he was a controversial figure, he had some spurious theories, and even this diagram that he created, it seems like he fudged a little bit of the drawings in order to make a stronger argument, but even with modern observations, these drawings are pretty close to being correct. And it's very, very compelling. It shows the embryonic development of a whole series of species, from a fish on the left to a reptile to birds to mammals and another mammal, to non-human mammals and, of course, to humans. And you can see at the early stages, they look eerily similar. In fact, you see proto gill slits in all of these animals, which later differentiate into things that are more suitable for what that animal actually becomes. And Haeckel, he's the guy who claimed ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, which is a very fancy way of saying that your embryonic development is telling the story of the evolutionary path, which isn't true, but you'll even hear people quote that today. But his drawings and his observations, this is compelling evidence for life sharing a common ancestry, coming from similar origins that got more and more different over time through the process of natural selection. So everything I've talked about so far has been kind of macro structure, things we can observe. The next thing I'm gonna talk about is, you can think about as micro structures or processes, and this is microbiology. Microbiology... Biolo, biology... Microbiology. And the more we understand about microbiology the more compelling case of evolution because when we look at even one, all life forms that we know, they involve DNA. How the DNA gets replicated and translated and transcribed is very similar from one life form to another. The idea of DNA going to, DNA coding for proteins, proteins, that are made up of amino acids is something that we see throughout biology. Amino acids, which once again hints at a common ancestry. And not only are those molecular and many of the very proteins are very, very similar, more similar than if you look at the macro level or even at the structural level between different species, and not just do they share these common microstructures and processes, but the actual information stored in things like DNA also are very, very strong evidence for evolution. So this is a picture, I got this from, I got this from the site, I should give proper credit, 23andme.com. But this and you'll see other data like this 1that's very similar to this, which is how much 1genetic similarity do we have between different 1species, and these numbers tell us how much genetic 1similarity at a high level do we have with 1chimpanzees, mice, fruit flies, yeast, and plants. 1And the fact that we have 26% of our genes 1in common with yeast is mind-blowing because 1at a macro level it doesn't seem like there's 1a lot in common with yeast, but when you get 1at a microbiological level, there's a good bit 1that's in common with yeast. 1And chimpanzees, we do relate to them, their facial 1expressions often feel eerily human, their behaviors 1often feel eerily human, but their genes, so just 1how close to human beings they actually are. 1And this actually shows that even mice are way 1closer, if you look at the entire tree of life 1based on genetic evidence, things like mice 1and even fruit flies are awfully close to human 1beings, especially if you were to compare it 1to bacteria or a plant. 1But once again, you share all of these common 1processes and the fact that we can now measure 1how far things are away allows us to create 1a very accurate tree of life, and especially 1thinking about how far in the past we had 1evolutionary common ancestors. 1Now the last thing that I promised I would talk 1about is direct evidence, direct evidence 1of evolution, and I talk about this in the first 1evolution video, but the direct evidence we see 1all the time with things like bacteria where 1you have bacteria, let's say growing around, 1and we have antibiotics that we use in our body 1to kill bacteria, but the reason why many 1physicians and scientists will tell you ""Don't 1""overuse antibiotics"" is because the more you use 1it, it causes a very strong natural selection 1process for bacteria that are going to be resistant 1to that antibiotic. 1So if you keep using an antibiotic and the bacterias 1keep changing, there's more and more variation, 1well you're gonna kill a lot of the bacteria 1but if even one of them is resistant to that 1antibiotic that you use, well then all of its 1competition is gonna get killed and so that 1drug-resistant superbug, it's often called, is going 1to be able to go nuts and that antibiotic isn't 1going to be able to do anything. 1And if you look at science today or you look 1at medicine today, this is kind of an arms race. 1You have this constant need to create new 1antibiotics because more and more bacteria are 1becoming drug-resistant, they're becoming what's 1often called superbugs, where they are resistant 1to the existing antibiotics. 1And this is evolution, natural selection, 1happening on a human scale. 1You could also think about the flu virus where every 1year that vaccine for the flu virus, you gotta get 1a new one every year because the virus is changing. 1Your immune system's ability to recognize it can't 1recognize the next year's because it's changed so much.",science_biology_her
" -  Let's say we're going to trace out a curve where our X coordinate and our Y coordinate that they are each defined by or they're functions of a third parameter T. So, we could say that X is a function of T and we could also say that Y is a function T. If this notion is completely unfamiliar to you, I encourage you to review the videos on parametric equations on Khan Academy. But what we're going to think about and I'm gonna talk about in generalities in this video. In future videos we're going to be dealing with more concrete examples but we're gonna think about what is the path that is traced out from when T is equal to A, so this is where we are when T is equal to A, so in this case this point would be X of A, comma Y of A, that's this point and then as we increase from T equals A to T is equal to B, so our curve might do something like this, so this is when T is equal to B, T is equal to B, so this point right over here is X of B, comma Y of B. Let's think about how do we figure out the length of this actual curve, this actual arc length from T equals A to T equals B? Well, to think about that we're gonna zoom in and think about what happens when we have a very small change in T? So, a very small change in T. Let's say we're starting at this point right over here and we have a very small change in T, so we go from this point to let's say this point over that very small change in T. It actually would be much smaller than this but if I drew it any smaller, you would have trouble seeing it. So, let's say that that is our very small change in our path in our arc that we are traveling and so, we wanna find this length. Well, we could break it down into how far we've moved in the X direction and how far we've moved in the Y direction. So, in the X direction, the X direction right over here, we would have moved a very small change in X and what would that be equal to? Well, that would be the rate of change with which we are changing with respect to T with which X is changing with respect to T times our very small change in T and this is a little hand wavy, I'm using differential notion and I'm conceptually using the idea of a differential as an infinitesimally small change in that variable. And so, this isn't a formal proof but it's to give us the intuition for how we derive arc length when we're dealing with parametric equations. So, this will hopefully make conceptual sense that this is our DX. In fact, we could even write it this way, DX/DT, that's the same thing as X prime of T times DT and then our change in Y is going to be the same idea. Our change in Y, our infinitesimally small change in Y when we have an infinitesimally small change in T, well, you could view that as your rate of change of Y with respect to T times your change in T, your very small change in T which is going to be equal to, we could write that as Y prime of T DT. Now, based on this, what would be the length of our infinitesimally small arc length right over here? Well, that we could just use the Pythagorean theorem. That is going to be the square root of, that's the hypotenuse of this right triangle right over here. So, it's gonna be the square root of this squared plus this squared. So, it is the square root of, I'm gonna give myself a little bit more space here because I think I'm gonna use a lot of it, so the stuff in blue squared, DX squared we could rewrite that as X prime of T DT squared plus this squared which is Y prime of T DT squared and now let's just try to simplify this a little bit. Remember, this is this infinitesimally small arc length right over here. So, we can actually factor out a DT squared, it's a term in both of these and so, we can rewrite this as, let me, so I can rewrite this and then write my big radical sign, so I'm gonna factor out a DT squared here, so we could write this as DT squared times X prime of T squared plus Y prime of T squared and then to be clear this is being multiplied by all of this stuff right over there. Well, now if we have this DT squared under the radical, we can take it out and so, we will have a DT and so, this is all going to be equal to the square root of, so the stuff that's still under the radical is going to be X prime of T squared plus Y prime of T squared and now we took out a DT and now we took out a DT. I could have written it right over here but I'm just writing it on the other side, we're just multiplying the two. So, this is once again just rewriting the expression for this infinitesimally small change in arc length. Well, what's lucky for us is in calculus we have the tools for adding up all of these infinitesimally small changes and that's what the definite integral does for us. So, what we can do if we wanna add up that plus that plus that plus that and remember, these are infinitesimally small changes. I'm just showing them as not infinitesimally just so that you can kind of think about them but if you were to add them all up, then we are essentially taking the integral and we're integrating with respect to T and so, we're starting at T is equal to A, all the way to T is equal to B and just like that we have been able to at least feel good conceptually for the formula of arc length when we're dealing with parametric equations. In the next few videos we'll actually apply it to figure out arc lengths.",math_calculus-2_cs2-parametric-equations-polar-coordinates-and-vector-valued-functions
" Over which interval does y of x have an average rate of change of negative 4? So average rate of change, if you think about it, you are literally just averaging for example, in this bowl section right over here. The slope is really, really steep. It gets less steep. It's a very negative slope, it gets less negative. Less negative slope is 0 here. Then it gets positive, more positive, and more positive, and more positive. But when you get to this point right over here, you see you got to where you started from. One you could say the net change has been 0. And any interval over which the net change has been 0 also tells you that the average rate of change is going to be 0. So you could view that the average rate of change is really the slope of the line that connects the two endpoints of your interval. So another way of asking over which interval does y of x have an average rate of change of negative 4 is, can you come up with an interval where the slope between the endpoints of the interval is negative 4? So let's see the choices they give us. This first interval is x is between negative 1 and 1. So x is between negative 1. So this is x is negative 1. When x is equal to negative 1, y of x is all the way over here. y of negative 1 is equal to 7. And then when x is equal to 1, our graph is down over here. y of 1 is negative 1. So what is the slope of the line that connects the endpoints of those two points? So what is the slope of this line? Because the slope of this line, the line that connects the endpoints of my interval, that is going to be the average rate of change over this interval. And you see very clearly that the slope here, the rate of change of y with respect to x is negative 4. Every time we move one ahead in the x direction, we move down four in the y direction. Move one ahead in the x direction, we move down four in the y direction. So the average rate of change over this interval is negative 4. So we didn't have to even look at anything else, that one will work.",math_math1_functions
" Let's keep going with our 2008 Calculus BC free answer questions. So we're on problem number 2. And I cut and pasted the table that they gave for the problem. And I'll read the rest of the problem. And let's see what we can do. So it says concert tickets went on sale at noon, t equals 0, and were sold out within 9 hours. The number of people waiting in line to purchase tickets at time t, is modeled by a twice differentiable function L, L of t. So this is the number of people waiting in line at anytime. And this is noon, 1 noon,  pm,  pm. All the tickets are sold by  pm. And they tell us it's twice differentiable. So that means that whatever function we're modeling this, this L of t, that it's continuous because it's differentiable. And since it's twice differentiable, we also know that its derivative is continuous because the second derivative exists at all points. So it says part a-- let me make sure I'm not writing too thickly-- use the data in the table to estimate the rate-- let me actually just copy and paste this, I've just figured out how to do this. So I figure it doesn't hurt. There you go. You probably can't read it. But it says use the data in the table to estimate the rate at which the number of people waiting in line was changing at  pm. So they don't give us any data on  pm. They give us  pm and  pm, or t equals 5.5. Show the computations that lead to your answer. Indicate the units of measure. So what do they want to know? They want to know an estimate of the rate at which the number of people waiting in line was changing. So they don't give us a continuous function definition. They just give us a bunch of sample points of this function L of t. So the best estimate I can do, of the rate at which this L of t is changing at time 5.5-- and 5.5 is in between these two-- is to just figure out the average rate of change between time 4 and time 7. So how do we figure that out? Well the average rate of change is just the slope. So let's write it. So we could write average rate of change or delta L over delta t at 5.5. You can write it however you want, however you think that the exam graders would best like to see it. We could say at time 5.5. We could say approximately equals, or whatever. But it's just going to be the slope between these two points. So it's L of 7 minus L of 4, all of that over 7 over 4. Rise over run or change in the value of the function divided by change in the independent variable. L of 7 is 154. They give us that. L of 4 is 126. And we divide it by 7 minus 4. So that equals 54 minus 126 is 24 plus 26 is 50. So it's equal to 28. Right, if this was 2 less, it would be 30. And 7 minus 4 is 3. So you could say that the average rate of change is 28 over 3. Or you could write that as 9 1/3. And they want us to use the units of measure. Indicate units of measure. So the numerator, this is people. And what's the denominator? It's hours, people per hour. So my best estimate, or our best estimate of the rate at which the number of people waiting in line was changing at  pm, which is between these two points, is the average slope between these two points. Which is 9 1/3 people per hour. That's it. Let's do part b. Let me clear all of this so we have enough space for part b. And I'll copy and don't know if you can read it. But maybe you can. So doesn't hurt to just copy and paste. OK part b says, use a trapezoidal sum with three subintervals. Maybe I can make this a little bit bigger. Let me see if I can grow that a little bit. I don't want to take up all the space though. No that doesn't look good. OK well I'll read it out loud in case you can't see it. Use a trapezoidal sum with three subintervals to estimate the average number of people waiting in line during the first 4 hours that the tickets were on sale. If you want to do this really fast, you wouldn't have to graph it. But I'm about to graph it because I want you to understand how to do this problem. If you understand it, you don't have to graph it. So let's graph some of these points. And we really just have to do the first 4 hours. Actually let's graph all of them, just because it might be useful in future parts of the problem. If you weren't graphing it while recording a video, it probably would be a little bit faster. That should be good enough. What are our data points? We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. You don't have do it so neatly. Well it's good to do it neatly when you're doing the exam, because otherwise you'll confuse yourself. And let's see, how high should my L values? This is time right here. This is my L of t axis. It goes up to about, 176 is a high point, at least on the data we have. Let's say this is 200. So halfway up would be 100. This would be 150. This would be 50. I don't know what that sound was from. But let's keep going forward. Let's plot the points. At t equals 0 there are 120 people in line. That's about right there. At t equals 1, 156. I'm just approximating. It's about right there. At t equals 3-- they skip 2-- at t equals 3 it's 176 people in line. So that's going to be right about there, just approximating it. At t equals 4, we have 126 people in line. It's a little bit more than at t equals 0. At t equals 7, we have 150 people in line. It's right about there. At t equals 8 we have 80. That's about right there. And t equal 9, the line is gone. Everyone has gotten their tickets, or maybe they got sold out. Let's connect those points. Connect the dots. So from here to there. And from there to there. There to there. There to there, almost done. OK so we've at least plotted the sample points and connected them with lines. We know that the real L of t, whatever we used to approximate it, it's not going to have these sharp edges because it's differentiable. It's actually twice differentiable. So it's actually going to be a smoother curve, right? Because we can take the derivative of any point. If this was the actual function, you wouldn't be able to take a derivative at this point. Because there's a positive slope here and then it immediately switches to a negative slope like the absolute value functions. You actually wouldn't be able to take the derivative at that point. But anyway back to the problem. Use a trapezoidal sum with three subintervals to estimate the average number of people waiting in line during the first 4 hours. So the first 4 hours, that's right here. Now this might seem kind of daunting. The trapezoidal sum for the fourth. Actually I just realized. For some reason, YouTube used to let me do longer videos because I thought I was a partner. But now for some reason it's been limiting me again. So I will continue part b in the next video. See you soon.",math_calculus-all-old_ap-calc-topic
" -  What we're going to do in this video is use the online graphing calculator Desmos, and explore the relationship between vertical and horizontal asymptotes, and think about how they relate to what we know about limits. So let's first graph two over x minus one, so let me get that one graphed, and so you can immediately see that something interesting happens at x is equal to one. If you were to just substitute x equals one into this expression, you're going to get two over zero, and whenever you get a non-zero thing, over zero, that's a good sign that you might be dealing with a vertical asymptote. In fact we can draw that vertical asymptote right over here at x equals one. But let's think about how that relates to limits. What if we were to explore the limit as x approaches one of f of x is equal to two over x minus one, and we could think about it from the left and from the right, so if we approach one from the left, let me zoom in a little bit over here, so we can see as we approach from the left when x is equal to zero, the f of x would be equal to negative two, when x is equal to point five, f of x is equal to negative of four, and then it just gets more and more negative the closer we get to one from the left. I could really, so I'm not even that close yet if I get to let's say 0.91, I'm still nine hundredths less than one, I'm at negative 22.222, already. And so the limit as we approach one from the left is unbounded, some people would say it goes to negative infinity, but it's really an undefined limit, it is unbounded in the negative direction. And likewise, as we approach from the right, we get unbounded in the positive infinity direction and technically we would say that that limit does not exist. And this would be the case when we're dealing with a vertical asymptote like we see over here. Now let's compare that to a horizontal asymptote where it turns out that the limit actually can exist. So let me delete these or just erase them for now, and so let's look at this function which is a pretty neat function, I made it up right before this video started but it's kind of cool looking, but let's think about the behavior as x approaches infinity. So as x approaches infinity, it looks like our y value or the value of the expression, if we said y is equal to that expression, it looks like it's getting closer and closer and closer to three. And so we could say that we have a horizontal asymptote at y is equal to three, and we could also and there's a more rigorous way of defining it, say that our limit as x approaches infinity is equal of the expression or of the function, is equal to three. Notice my mouse is covering it a little bit as we get larger and larger, we're getting closer and closer to three, in fact we're getting so close now, well here you can see we're getting closer and closer and closer to three. And you could also think about what happens as x approaches negative infinity and here you're getting closer and closer and closer to three from below. Now one thing that's interesting about horizontal asymptotes is you might see that the function actually can cross a horizontal asymptote. It's crossing this horizontal asymptote in this area in between and even as we approach infinity or negative infinity, you can oscillate around that horizontal asymptote. Let me set this up, let me multiply this times sine of x. And so there you have it, we are now oscillating around the horizontal asymptote, and once again this limit can exist even though we keep crossing the horizontal asymptote, we're getting closer and closer and closer to it the larger x gets. And that's actually the key difference between a horizontal and a vertical asymptote. Vertical asymptotes if you're dealing with a function, you're not going to cross it, while with a horizontal asymptote, you could, and you are just getting closer and closer and closer to it as x goes to positive infinity or as x goes to negative infinity.",math_calculus-1_cs1-limits-and-continuity
" Let's say we define the random variable capital X as the number of heads we get after three flips of a fair coin. So given that definition of a random variable, what we're going to try and do in this video is think about the probability distributions. So what is the probability of the different possible outcomes or the different possible values for this random variable. We'll plot them to see how that distribution is spread out amongst those possible outcomes. So let's think about all of the different values that you could get when you flip a fair coin three times. So you could get all heads, heads, heads, heads. You could get heads, heads, tails. You could get heads, tails, heads. You could get heads, tails, tails. You could have tails, heads, heads. You could have tails, head, tails. You could have tails, tails, heads. And then you could have all tails. So there's eight equally, when you do the actual experiment there's eight equally likely outcomes here. But which of them, how would these relate to the value of this random variable? So let's think about, what's the probability, there is a situation where you have zero heads. So what's the probably that our random variable X is equal to zero? Well, that's this situation right over here where you have zero heads. It's one out of the eight equally likely outcomes. So that is going to be 1/8. What's the probability that our random variable capital X is equal to one? Well, let's see. Which of these outcomes gets us exactly one head? We have this one right over here. We have that one right over there. We have this one right over there. And I think that's all of them. So three out of the eight equally likely outcomes provide us, get us to one head, which is the same thing as saying that our random variable equals one. So this has a 3/8 probability. So what's the probability, I think you're getting, maybe getting the hang of it at this point. What's the probability that the random variable X is going to be equal to two? Well, for X to be equal to two, we must, that means we have two heads when we flip the coins three times. So that's this outcome meets this constraint. This outcome would get our random variable to be equal to two. And this outcome would make our random variable equal to two. And this is three out of the eight equally likely outcomes. So this has a 3/8 probability. And then finally we could say what is the probability that our random variable X is equal to three? Well, how does our random variable X equal three? Well we have to get three heads when we flip the coin. So there's only one out of the eight equally likely outcomes that meets that constraint. So it's a 1/8 probability. So now we just have to think about how we plot this, to see how this is distributed. So let me draw... So over here on the vertical axis this will be the probability. Probability. And it's going to be between zero and one. You can't have a probability larger than one. So just like this. So let's see, if this is one right over here, and let's see everything here looks like it's in eighths so let's put everything in terms of eighths. So that's half. This is a fourth. That's a fourth. That's not quite a fourth. This is a fourth right over here. And then we can do it in terms of eighths. So that's a pretty good approximation. And then over here we can have the outcomes. Outcomes. And so outcomes, I'll say outcomes for alright let's write this so value for X So X could be zero actually let me do those same colors, X could be zero. X could be one. X could be two. X could be equal to two. X could be equal to three. X could be equal to three. So these are the possible values for X. And now we're just going to plot the probability. The probability that X has a value of zero is 1/8. That's, I'll make a little bit of a bar right over here that goes up to 1/8. So let draw it like this. So goes up to, so this is 1/8 right over here. The probability that X equals one is 3/8. So 2/8, 3/8 gets us right over let me do that in the purple color So probability of one, that's 3/8. That's right over there. That's 3/8. So let me draw that bar, draw that bar. And just like that. The probability that X equals two. The probability that X equals two is also 3/8. So that's going to be on the same level. Just like that. And then, the probability that X equals three well that's 1/8. So it's going to the same height as this thing over here. I'm using the wrong color. So it's going to look like this. It's going to look like this. And actually let me just write this a little bit neater. I can write that three. Cut and paste. Move that three a little closer in so that it looks a little bit neater. And I can actually move that two in actually as well. So cut and paste. So I can move that two. And there you have it! We have made a probability distribution for the random variable X. And the random variable X can only take on these discrete values. It can't take on the value half or the value pi or anything like that. So this, what we've just done here is constructed a discrete probability distribution. Let me write that down. So this is a discrete, it only, the random variable only takes on discrete values. It can't take on any values in between these things. So discrete probability. Probability distribution. Distribution for our random variable X.",math_ap-statistics_random-variables-ap
" -  If I had been handed this problem on a physics test I probably would have freaked out. This looks really intimidating but it's actually not that bad. It's a classic example of a two lens system and overall, before we get lost in details here. The overall idea of how we're going to approach is this. We've got two lenses. This 1st lens is going to create an image of this object over here. It creates an image of this object. Then the 2nd lens is going to create an image of that image and so what we're basically going to do is we're going to use the thin lens formula. We're first going to pretend like this 2nd lens doesn't exist. We're going to figure out, what image does this 1st lens create? Then, we'll pretend like the 1st lens doesn't exist and we'll treat that image that the 1st lens creates as if it's the object for the 2nd lens. We'll do another calculation, figure out where this 2nd lens creates an image of the thing it thinks is the object but it's actually the image from the 1st one and so we're going to figure out first the object gets turned into an image from the 1st lens, then the 2nd lens turns that image into another image and that's what our eye is going to see. So that's the question we want to answer is what image would our eye see in this case if we had it over here looking through these two lenses? So let's do this. First thing we got to do is I'm going to pretend like the 2nd lens doesn't exist so it doesn't confuse me. We use the thin lens equation. Alright here we go. 1 over f, so 1 over, okay here we go, 12 centimeters, do I make it positive or negative? It's on the left. Maybe I make it negative, nope. The only thing you look at is what kind of lens this is. This is a convex lens. I can tell by the way it's drawn. Since this is a convex lens my focal length is going to be positive 12 centimeters. So that's what I plug in, Positive 12 centimeters equals, alright, object distance so 1 over the object distance that's 24 right? No, all distances are measured from the center of the lens to the thing you're looking at and so for an object distance I'd have to go from the center of the lens all the way to the object. Don't just plug in any number they're giving you. You've got to plug in that distance and that's going to be 24 plus 12. It's actually 36. So I'd have 1 over and this is going to be 36 centimeters. Positive or negative? Well that's going to be positive here. We've got two lenses but for this first case it's on the left hand side. Everything's cool, it's on the opposite side as my eye. It's going to be a positive 36. I'll show you in a minute how this could possibly be negative in a second. Plus 1 over the image distance. I'll just label that with a di. Alright so now we just got to solve. If you solve this you going to go 1 over 12 centimeters minus 1 over 36 centimeters equals 1 over di what you're going to end up getting is 1 over 18 centimeters on the left hand side equals 1 over di but that's 1 over di, if you solve that for di you'll get that di equals 18 centimeters positive 18 centimeters. And so what does that mean? Where is this? Well, alright, di, positive image distance. Remember, positive means on the same side as your eye for a lens. So I'm going to have an image that's formed over on this side of the lens and 18 means 18 centimeters from where? From the center of the lens. So if I draw this. I'm going to go 18 from here. That's going to be past the focal point because I know the focal point is only 12 so I'm going to be somewhere around here. I'm going to label that and that's going to be 18 centimeters and that's where the first images, so that's where the image is going to be that this 1st lens creates. It's going to be right there. Okay so now what do I do? I told you, here's what we do. We pretend, we'll bring the 2nd lens back. We know the image that the 1st lens created is right here. This 2nd lens is going to think that that's the object. It's going to create an image of that image as if that were an object. So we do another thin lens formula but this time we treat this positive 18 not at if it's the image, we treat it like it's the object. So this is going to be well, it's not going to be equal to do because remember, you have to measure everything from where? From the center of the lens so for this second calculation, my object distance is going to be from the center of the lens all the way to, let me not use that color. Let me see, let's pick this one here. From the center of the lens all the way to where it's object is and it's object is over here which is not 18. That's why it gave you this distance between lenses. The distance between lenses is 33 centimeters. So if the distance from this 1st lens is 18 well the difference has to be equal to this length. So 33 minus 18 is going to be 15, whoops. 15 centimeters will be where the ""object"" for this 2nd lens is going to be. So as we turn this positive 18 into object distance of positive 15 centimeters. Why positive? Well it's still on this left hand side opposite side as your eye. That's where the objects are supposed to be. Now here, this is where I told you there's one case where you can get negative object distances if our 1st lens would have created an image of this object way over here on the wrong side of the lens. In other words, if this 1st lens created an image that was closer to our eye than the 2nd lens was, well that's just all messed up. That's going to be a negative object distance. Your not supposed to hold an object between your eye and the lens. So we'd count that, you'd do your calculation just the same. I mean everything would work out right. It's not like the whole thing's going to break. You'd get an image. It's just when you do your calculation for the second case. If your image ended up on the wrong side of the lens for the first image that was created you'd have to treat it as a negative object distance. That didn't happen here. Our image is still formed on this side. We're going to pretend like this 1st lens didn't exist. We got an object over here, we're going to treat it like our object. Everything's fine. Eye looking through the lens at our object. So we still treat this as a positive 15. So let's do our calculation. We'll have for this lens it's going to be 1 over. Alright, focal length. What do we look at for focal length? We look at what type of lens it is. This lens is a diverging lens. Diverging lenses always get contributed, always have a negative focal length that they contribute into this equation. So a negative 10 centimeters. That's the focal length of the 2nd lens, equals 1 over our object distance we just found. It's not really an object but that's okay. It's an image but this lens doesn't know that. It thinks it's an object so 1 over positive 15 because it's still on the side that that object was supposed to be on, plus 1 over our image. This is going to be a second image. This is the second image that this lens system is going to create and so I'll just put di. Alright, so we do the math, alright 1 over negative 10 centimeters minus 1 over 15 centimeters equals 1 over di, you solve that on the left hand side. You flip it over, you're going end up getting the di is, once you do that inversion negative 6 centimeters. That's what our second image is going to be. So what does this mean? Negative 6 centimeters. This is always from the lens and negative. Remember negative distance means on the left hand side or the opposite side as your eye. So I'm going to come up here and I'm going to draw a line that goes from the center of my lens, 6 centimeters to the left somewhere around there. So that's going to be 6 centimeters right here. Whoops, I'll label that. That's going to be 6 centimeters because that's our image distance and that means our final image is right there. Our eye is going to see an image of something our arrow right at that spot right there that's where our image is going to be and just to recap what happened. So this 1st lens created an image of the object over at this point here, this 15 centimeter point and then the 2nd lens created an image of that image. It treated it like it was an object and it created an image at this white point right here that's where we're going to see the image but we don't know what it's going to look like. These calculations, this thin lens formula only shows us where the image is going to be. If we wanted to figure out how big it was we have to use the magnification formula so let's do that. Over here, magnification equals negative di. Remember it's negative di over do. Alright, so what was di for this first case? We're going to do it one step at a time. For this first case, the di was positive 18. So I'm going to put a positive 18 up here. I'm going to leave off the units because they're going to cancel. Do was not 24 it was 36. So what do I get? I get negative 18 over 36 that's 1/2, negative 1/2. 1What does that mean? 1That means this 1st lens, the image 1that it created is going to be an image 1that's 1/2 as big as my object 1and it's going to be negative magnification. 1That means it's upside down so I'm going to 1draw this first image. 1I'm going to do it in orange 1because that's what I labeled the image distance. 1It's going to be upside down 1and half as big as the object. 1So if the object was that big. 1My image is going to be upside down 1and about half as big. 1So this was my image one. 1I'll label it image one. 1That's what I'm treating as my second object. 1So that's image one that's object two 1essentially because that's what this 12nd lens is going to think is the object. 1What magnification does it provide? 1Well let's do that one. 1Magnification equals negative di over do 1so negative of my image distance for 1this 2nd lens was, it was negative 6 1remember right here? 1That's what we solved. 1The 2nd lens created an image distance negative 6. 1I'll leave off the units because they cancel 1and my object distance for 1the 2nd lens was 15 centimeters. 1That's what this was right here. 1The distance from the lens to where 1it's ""object"" was and that was positive 15 1and what do I get? 1If you take negative 6 over 15 1you end up getting positive 2/5. 1So this is the second magnification. 1The magnification of the 1st lens was negative 1/2. 1The magnification of the 2nd lens was positive 2/5. 1That means at this point over here, 1I'll make it white because that's where 1I labeled this image distance. 1I'm going to get an image that's 12/5 as big as what? 1As the 1st image. 1Now this is a magnification of the image 1because that's what this 2nd lens is doing. 1So I don't look back at my object over here. 1I'm done with this guy for now. 1Now I'm just looking at what this 2nd lens 1thinks is the object. 1So 2/5 as big as this object and positive 1means right side up but in this case 1this really just means not inverted. 1So this started off our object for 1the 2nd lens started off upside down. 1This positive means that you maintain 1the direction, you don't invert it. 1So I leave this thing upside down. 1That's what it means 1I leave it upside down. 1If it would have started right side up 1I would have left it right side up 1but in this case, I leave it upside down 1and I make it 2/5 as big. 12/5 is a little under 1/2 and so I'm going 1to draw this about like that. 1That's where my image would be, right there. 1That's what I would see. 1I would see a very little image 1that's upside down and it would be 1right around there and so that's an example 1of where you can do a two lens system. 1You treat each lens separately 1and you use these formulas accordingly. 1The last thing I'll say is, 1if you wanted to know why we had 1two magnifications here, is there some way 1to figure out the total magnification? 1Some slick way of doing it? 1Yeah and it's really easy it turns out. 1You can just take your total magnification. 1If all I wanted to know was if I had this object 1what my total magnification was going to be. 1What could I multiply this object's height by, 1in other words, what factor could 1I multiply it by to get both 1the orientation and height of this final image? 1Well you just take the magnification 1of the 1st lens times the magnification 1of the 2nd lens. 1If I had more I'd just multiply them all. 1That would give me the factor. 1That's the overall magnification that I can 1multiply this object's height by 1to get the height of the final image 1and the orientation of it. 1It doesn't give you the position. 1This just gives you the overall magnification, 1That could be handy if your making 1a microscope or something but it doesn't 1tell you the position. 1For the position you've got to use 1these thin lens formulas. 1So that's how you treat a multiple lens problem.",science_physics_geometric-optics
" Let's say I have some function f of x that is defined as being equal to x squared minus 6x plus 8 for all x. And what I want to do is show that for this function we can definitely find a c in an interval where the derivative at the point c is equal to the average rate of change over that interval. So let's give ourselves an interval right over here. Let's say we care about the interval between 2 and 5. And this function is definitely continuous over this closed interval, and it's also differentiable over it. And it just has to be differentiable over the open interval, but this is differentiable really for all x. And so let's show that we can find a c that's inside the open interval, that's a member of the open interval, that's in the open interval such that the derivative at c is equal to the average rate of change over this interval. Or is equal to the slope of the secant line between the two endpoints of the interval. So it's equal to f of 5 minus f of 2 over 5 minus 2. And so I encourage you to pause the video now and try to find a c where this is actually true. Well to do that, let's just calculate what this has to be. Then let's just take the derivative and set them equal and we should be able to solve for our c. So let's see f of 5 minus f of 2, f of 5 is, let's see, f of 5 is equal to 25 minus 30 plus 8. So that's negative 5 plus 8 is equal to 3. f of 2 is equal to 2 squared minus 12. So it's 4 minus 12 plus 8. That's going to be a 0. So this is equal to 3/3, which is equal to 1. f prime of c needs to be equal to 1. And so what is the derivative of this? Well let's see, f prime of x is equal to 2x minus 6. And so we need to figure out at what x value, especially it has to be in this open interval, at what x value is it equal to 1? So this needs to be equal to 1. So let's add 6 to both sides. You get 2x is equal to 7. x is equal to 7/2, which is the same thing as 3 and 1/2. So it's definitely in this interval right over here. So we've just found our c is equal to 7/2. And let's just graph this to really make sure that this makes sense. So this right over here is our y-axis. And then this right over here is our x-axis. Looks like all the action is happening in the first and fourth quadrants. So that is our x-axis. And let's see, let's say this is 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. So we already know that 2 is one of the zeroes here. So we know that our function if we wanted to graph it, it intersects the x-axis right over here. And you can factor this out as x minus 2 times x minus 4. So the other place where our function hits 0 is when x is equal to 4 right over here. Our vertex is going to be right in between at x is equal to 3. When x is equal to 3, let's see, 9 minus 18 is negative 9 plus 8, so negative 1. So you have the point 3, negative 1 on it. And so that's enough for us to graph. And we also know at 5, we're at 3. So 1, 2, 3. So at 5, we are right over here. So over the interval that we care about, our graph looks something like this. So that's the interval that we care about. And we're saying that we were looking for a c whose slope is the same as the slope of the secant line, same as the slope of the line between these two points. And if I were to just visually look at it, I'd say well yeah, it looks like right around there just based on my drawing, the slope of the tangent line looks like it's parallel. It looks like it has the same slope, looks like the tangent line is parallel to the secant line. And that looks like it's right at 3 and 1/2 or 7/2. So it makes sense. So this right over here is our c. c is equal to 7/2.",math_ap-calculus-ab_ab-diff-analytical-applications-new
" -  Let's say, for some reason, you had lent the government $1,000, and so the government has given you a formally issued piece of paper that says, ""Hey, we, the government, owe you $1,000."" This is issued by the Treasury. This could be a Treasury bond. It could be a T-Bill of some kind. And let's say that the Federal Reserve, the central bank is interested in inserting money into our system. So let's say this is the Federal Reserve right over here. Federal Reserve. And so what they do is they create $1,000 of Federal Reserve Notes, what we associate as paper money, and they pay it to you and they buy the Treasury, so the Treasury goes to the Federal Reserve from you. And so, in an exchange, you get this newly created money that the Federal Reserve just created. So, there you go. You have, this is $1,000. Now, what would you likely do with that $1,000? Well, it might not be safe to walk around town with your pockets bulging like that, so a lot of folks would deposit it into a bank. So let's think about what would happen to the bank's balance sheet. So, you go to the Bank A and I'm just gonna think about what was the balance sheet, the pre-existing balance sheet for the bank, but let's just think about what happens to its assets and its liabilities when you make the deposit. A for assets, L for liabilities. If you deposit those thousand dollars, then your assets for the bank is going to get $1,000 in reserves, but you didn't just give them the money. They have a liability to you. You should have a checkable deposit account now, so we could say checking account. So now, you have a $1,000 checking account which you would use an asset for yourself but it's a liability for the bank. At any time, you could come and ask for that thousand dollars. $1,000 checking account and this would be for you. Now, we've already spent several videos talking about fractional-reserve lending and there's two ways we can conceptualize it as we've seen in those videos but I'm gonna go with the simpler version of fractional-reserve lending. And so this bank says, ""Look, we are in a world ""where our reserve requirement,"" I will do a reserve requirement. This actually is a typical reserve requirement. The reserve requirement in this country is 10%, which says that the bank only has to keep 10% of these cash reserves and then it could loan out the rest, and so it does that. That's its business model or a significant part of its business model. And so, what it does is instead of having $1,000 in reserves, it keeps 10%, so it keeps $100, and it loans out the rest. And so, it loans out $900. So, it's loaning out now $900 to someone else, hopefully someone who is good for the money, who maybe they're gonna invest it into their business or they're going to buy a house, or whatever else. Now once again, the bank just didn't give them the money. In exchange, they get an asset, which is an IOU from that person. That person owes the bank money. They owe them $900. So, we could say that in exchange for giving 'em that cash, they're going to have a $900 loan on their balance sheet as an asset. Now once again, the person that they lent the money to, the loan would be a liability, they owe the money, but for the bank, that's an asset. ""Hey, someone owes me, the bank, $900."" But then what's this person going to do? Well once again, their pocket's are gonna bulge quite as much but they still might not wanna walk around town with $900 in their pocket, so they are likely to deposit in a bank and they could deposit it in Bank A or they could deposit it in another bank. Let's call it very creatively, Bank B, all right (chuckles). So, Bank B, same exercise. I think you might see where this is going, so its assets, its liabilities. And so they go and they deposit this $900, so you have $900 right over there. And the corresponding liability, that person then give the money to the bank, that person can demand that money at any point from the bank, and so you have a $900 checking account, checking account. And that person would drop on that checking account to buy the machinery for their business or whatever else. But once again, we have a 10% reserve requirement, which says that the bank only has to keep 10% of that, and so their business model is they do only keep 10% of it and then the rest of it, they loan out. So, they loan out $810. It could be a loan or it could be multiple loans altogether. And I think you see where this is going. So, this is lent out to someone else, so now we have $810, which can then be deposited in another bank, Bank C. They can lend out 90% of that and that process keeps going on and on and on and on. So, an interesting question is given this infusion of a thousand dollars and given this reserve requirement, how much total money has been created? Well, in one other videos, we talk about the multiple measures of the money supply. When the Federal Reserve put this $1,000, a Federal Reserve Notes into circulation, they increased the monetary base by $1,000, but one measure of the monetary supply is, well, what are the Federal Reserve Notes, the coins, and the paper money that's in circulation, plus the amount of checkable deposits, and we talk about that in other videos as M1. And so, our M1 over here, what's it gonna be? Well, this person has a thousand dollar checking account, $1,000 checking out, they think they have $1,000 that they can write checks against and they do. And this person has a $900 checking account, $900 checking out. And then this person right over here that when they deposit their money, they're gonna think they have an $810 checking account. They have that. And then that process, they're gonna go on and on and on and on. Someone else, when this $810 gets deposited, the bank's gonna lend out 90% of that. That person's gonna think they have that amount of money. And so what we do is we're just multiplying by .9 every time. We're multiplying by one minus the reserve requirement every time. And we've done the mathematics on this multiple times. This is going to be equal to $1,000, the initial amount that was put into the monetary base, times one over one minus 0.9 and that is just going to be equal to $1,000 times one over 0.1 or you could just view this as one over the reserve requirement. It just happened to be 0.1 in this example. Reserve requirement. And you could do the math on what that's going to be. One divided by 1/10 is going to be 10, and so our M1 money supply that has been created in this very simple example is going to be equal to 10 times the thousand dollars, so it's gonna be equal to $10,000. So, big picture. When the monetary base is increased by a certain amount, if you know the reserve requirement and if you assume that all the banks minimize their reserves, that they keep only the 10%, they don't keep 11% or 12% or 20%, then what this calculation is gonna show you is what is going to be the maximum effect on M1 given that infusion into the monetary base. And all it is is the amount that was infused times one over the reserve requirement.",economics-finance-domain_ap-macroeconomics_ap-financial-sector

" Let's now think about Type 2 regions. And you'll see that they're kind of very similar definitions and it's really a question of orientation. Type 2 region is a region-- I'll call it R2-- that's the set of all x, y's, and z's in three dimensions such that-- and now instead of thinking of our domain in terms of xy-coordinates, we're going to think of them in terms of yz coordinates, such that our yz pairs are a member of some domain. I'll call it D2 since we're talking about Type 2 regions. And x is bounded below by some function of yz. So I'll call it g1 of yz is less than or equal to x, which is less than or equal to some other function of yz, g2 of yz. And so you'll immediately see a very similar way of thinking about it, but instead of having z vary between two functions of x and y as we had in a Type 1 region, we now have x varying between two functions of y and z. Now let's think about some of the shapes we explored. We saw that these two right up here, this sphere and the cylinder, were Type 1 regions, but this dumbbell, the way that I oriented it here, was not a Type 1 region. Let's think about which of these are Type 2 regions and what might not be a Type 2 region. So first let's think about the sphere. So I have my axes right over here. Let me scroll down a little bit. So I got my axes. And so over here, our domain, we could still construct our sphere, but our domain is now going to be in the yz plane. So yz plane is this business right over here. So this will be our domain. I want to make it more spherical than that. So our domain is this right over here in the yz plane. That is our D2. And now the lower bound, in order to construct the solid region of the sphere or the globe or whatever you want to call it, the lower bound on x would be kind of the back half of the sphere, the one that's away from us right over here. So the lower bound-- so let me see how well I can wire frame it at first. I can do a better job than that. So with my ghost do something like that, then do something like that. But this is if the domain right over here is transparent. But all we might catch-- we'll just catch a glimpse of it in the back right over here. So it's the side of the sphere that's facing away from us. And then the upper bound on x would be the side of the sphere that's facing us. So if I were to do some contours, it might look something like this and then look something like this. And then we would color in this entire region right over here. And x can take on all of the values above that magenta surface and below this green surface. And essentially, it would fill up the globe for every yz point in our domain. So a sphere is both a Type 1 and a Type 2 region. Actually, we're going to see it's going to be a Type 3 region as well. What about this cylinder right over here? Can we construct it or think about it in a way that it would actually be a Type 2 region? So let's try to do that. So let me paste it. So what if we had a domain-- what if our domain was something like this? It was a rectangle in the yz plane. So this is our domain, a rectangle in the yz plane. So that would be my D2. And what if the lower bound was kind of the back side of the cylinder? So the backside of the cylinder, try to draw it as good as I can. And so if we just saw the outside of it, it would look something like that. It's facing away from us so we barely see it. If we could see through the cylinder or see through the little flat cut of the cylinder, it would look something like that. So that over there would be our g1. And then our g2 would be the front side of the cylinder. The g2 could be the front side of the cylinder. So let me color it in as best as I can. So the g2 would be the front side of cylinder. And x can vary above g1 and below g2, and it would fill up this entire cylinder. So we see that this same cylinder that we also saw was a Type 1 region can also be a Type 2 region. Now what about this hourglass thing that we saw could not be a Type 1 region? Can this be a Type 2 region? Well, let's think about it. I'll do it the same way. We can construct a domain. So maybe our domain, it's in the y-- well, it should be in the yz plane if we're talking about Type 2 regions or if we want to think of it as a Type 2 region. So our domain could be this kind of flat hourglass shape that's in the yz plane. So our domain could be a region that looks something like this in the yz plane. So this is kind of flattened out. So this is our domain right over there. And then the lower bound on x, g1, could be a surface, the function of y and z that is kind of the backside of our hourglass. The backside of our hourglass you could see. I'll try to show the contours from the underside right over there. So that could be our g1. And then our g2 could be the front side of the hourglass. So my best attempt to draw the front side of the hourglass. And I could color it in. And so the way I somewhat confusingly drew it just now, you see that this hourglass oriented the way it is would actually be a Type 2 region. Now if we were to rotate it like this-- so let me draw it like this. Edit. So if we were to make it like this so that the top of my hourglass is facing us-- try my best to draw it. So let's say the top intersects the x-axis right over there. This is the bottom of my hourglass right over there. And then it bends in and then comes back out like that. For the same reasons that this was not a Type 1 region, this now would not be a Type 2 region. For any zy, you can see there could be multiple x points that are associated with the different points of this hourglass. You can't just have a simple lower and upper round functions right over here. So this right over here is not a Type 2 region. You could show a rationale or this is going to be a Type 1 region. You could create a region over here in the xy plane and have an upper and lower bound functions for z. So you could be Type 1, but this will not be Type 2.",math_multivariable-calculus_greens-theorem-and-stokes-theorem
" -  A company screens job applicants for illegal drug use at a certain stage in their hiring process. The specific test they use has a false positive rate of two percent and a false negative rate of one percent. Suppose that five percent of all their applicants are actually using illegal drugs and we randomly select an applicant. Giving the applicant test positive, what is the probability that they are actually on drugs? So let's work through this together. So first let's make sure we understand what they're telling us. So there is this drug test for the job applicants and then the test has a false positive rate of two percent. What does that mean? That means that in two percent of the cases, when it should have read negative, that the person didn't do the drugs, it actually read positive. It is a false positive. It should have read negative but it read positive. Another way to think about it. If someone did not do drugs and you take this test, there's a two percent chance saying that you did do the illegal drugs. They also say that there is a false negative rate of one percent. What does that mean? That means that one percent of the time if someone did actually take the illegal drugs, it'll say that they didn't. It is falsely giving a negative result when it should have given a positive one. And then they say that five percent of all their applicants are actually using illegal drugs. So there is several ways that we can think about it. One of the easiest way to conceptualize is just, let's just make up a large number of applicants, and I'll use a number where it's fairly straightforward to do the mathematics. So let's say that we start of with 10,000 applicants. I will both talk in absolute numbers, and I just made this number up. It could have been 1,000, it could have been 100,000, but I like this number 'cause it's easy to do the math better than saying 9,785. This is also going to be 100% of the applicants. Now they give us some crucial information here. They tell us that five percent of all their applicants are actually using illegal drugs. So we can immediately break this 10,000 group into the ones that are doing the drugs and the ones that are not. So five percent are actually on the drugs, 95% are not on the drugs. So what's five percent of 10,000? So that would be 500. So 500 on drugs, on drugs. Once again, this is five percent of our original population. And then how many are not on drugs? Well 9,500 not on drugs. And once again, this is 95% of our group of applicants. So now let's administer the test. So what is going to happen when we administer the test to the people who are on drugs? Well the test, ideally, would give a positive result. It would say positive for all of them, but we know that it's not a perfect test. It's going to give negative for some of them. It will falsely give a negative result for some of them, and we know that because it has a false negative rate of one percent. Of these 500, 99% is going to get the correct result in that they're going to test positive. So what is 99% of 500? Well let's see, that would be 495. 495 are going to test positive. I will just use a positive right over there. And then we're going to have one percent, which is five, are going to test negative. They are going to falsely test negative. This is the false negative rate. If we say, what percent of our original applicant pool is on drugs and tests positive, well 495 over 10,000. This is 4.95%. What percent is of the original applicant pool that is on drugs but tests negative for drugs? The test says that hey they're not doing drugs. Well this is gonna be five out of 10,000. Which is 0.05%. Another way that you could get these percentages. If you take five percent and multiply by one percent, you're goin to get 0.05%. 500ths of a percent. If you take five percent and multiply by 99%, you're going to get 4.95%. Now let's keep going. Now let's go to the folks who aren't taking the drugs. And this is where the false positive rate is going to come into effect. So we have a false positive rate of two percent. So two percent are going to test positive. What's two percent of 9,500? It's 190 would test positive even though they're not on drugs. This is the false positive rate. So they are testing positive, and then the other 98% will correctly come out negative. The other 98%, so 9,500 minus 190, that's gonna be 9,310 will correctly test negative. Now what percent of the original applicant pool is this? Well 190 is 1.9%, and we could calculate it by 190 over 10,000 or you could just say two percent of 95% is 1.9%. Once again, multiply the path along the tree. What percent is 9.310? Well that is going to be 93.10%. You could say this is 9,310 over 10,000 or you can multiply by the path on our probability tree here. 95% times 98% gets us to 93.10%. But now I think we are ready to answer the question. Given that the applicant tests positive, what is the probability that they are actually on drugs? So let's look at the first part. Given the applicant tests positive. So which applicants actually tested positive? You have these 495 here tested positive, correctly tested positive, and then you have these 190 right over here incorrectly tested positive, but they did test positive. So how many tested positive? Well we have 495 plus 190 tested positive. That's the total number that tested positive, and then which of them were actually on the drugs? Well of the ones that tested positive, 495 were actually on the drugs. We have 495 divided by 495 plus 190 is equal to 0.7226. So we could say approximately 72%. Approximately 72%. Now this is really interesting. Given the applicant tests positive, what is the probability that they are actually on drugs? When you look at these false positive and false negative rates, they seem quite low, but now when you actually did the calculation, the probability that someone's actually on drugs is, it's high, but it's not that high. It's not like if someone were to test positive that you'd say oh they are definitely taking the drugs. And you could also get to this result just by using the percentages. For example, you could think in terms of what percentage of the original applicants end up testing positive? Well that's 4.95% plus 1.9%. 4.95, we'll just do it in terms of percent, plus 1.9%, and of them, what percentage were actually on the drugs? Well that was the 4.95%. And notice this would give you the exact same result. Now there's an interesting takeaway here. Because this is saying, of the people that test positive, 72% are actually on the drugs. You could think about it the other way around. Of the people who test positive. 495 plus 190, what percentage aren't on drugs? Well that was 190, and this comes out to be approximately 28%. 100% minus 72%. If we were in a court of law and let's say the prosecuting attorney, let's say I got tested positive for drugs and the prosecuting attorney says look, this test is very good. It only has a false positive rate of two percent and Sal tested positive, he is probably taking drugs. A jury who doesn't really understand this well or go through the trouble that we just did might say, oh yeah Sal probably took the drugs. But when we look at this, even if I test positive using this test, there's a 28% chance that I'm not taking drugs. That I was just in this false positive group, 1and the reason why this number is a good bit larger 1than this number 1is because when we looked at the original division 1between those who take drugs and don't take drugs, 1most don't take the illegal drugs. 1Two percent of this larger group 1of the ones that don't take the drugs, 1well this is actually a fairly large number 1relative to the percentage that do take the drugs 1and test positive. 1So I will leave you there. 1This is fascinating not just for this particular case, 1but you will see analysis like this all the time 1when we're looking at whether a certain medication 1is effective or a certain procedure is effective. 1It's important to be able to do this analysis.",math_ap-statistics_probability-ap
" Factor 8k squared minus 24k minus 144. Now the first thing we can do here, just eyeballing each of these terms, if we want to simplify it a good bit is all of these terms are divisible by 8. Clearly, 8k squared is divisible by 8, 24 is divisible by 8, and 144-- it might not be as obvious is divisible by 8-- but it looks like it is. 8 goes into one and 144, 8 goes into 14 one time. 1 times 8 is 8. Subtract, you get a 6. 14 minus 8 is 6. Bring down the 4. 8 goes into 64 eight times. So it goes into 144 18 times. So let's just factor out an 8 of this. And then that will simplify our expression. It will actually give us a leading 1 coefficient. So this will become 8 times k squared minus 24 divided by 8 is 3k minus 18. Now we have to factor this business in here. And remember if anything has the form x squared plus bx plus c, where you have a leading 1 coefficient-- this is implicitly a one-- we have that here in this expression in parentheses. Then we literally just need to-- and we can do this multiple ways-- but we need to find two numbers whose sum is equal to the coefficient on x. So two numbers whose sum is equal to negative 3 and whose product is equal to the constant term. And whose product is equal to negative 18. So let's just think about the factors of negative 18 here. Let's see if we can do something interesting. So it could be 1. And since it's negative, one of the numbers has to be positive, one has to be negative 1 and 18 is if it was positive. And then one of these could be positive and then one of these could be negative. But no matter what if this is negative and this is positive then they add up to 17. If you switch them, then they add up to negative 17. So those won't work. So either we could write it this way, positive or negative 1, and then negative or positive 18 to show that they have to be different signs. So those don't work. Then you have positive or negative 3. And then negative or positive 6, just to know that they are different signs. So if you have positive 3 and negative 6, they add up to negative 3 which is what we need them to add up to. And clearly, positive 3 and negative 6, their product is negative 18. So it works. So we're going to go with positive 3 and negative 6 as our two numbers. Now, for this example-- just for the sake of this example-- We'll do this by grouping. So what we can do is we can separate this middle term right here as the sum of 3k negative 6k. So I could write the negative 3k as plus 3k minus 6k. And then let me write the rest of it. So we have k squared up here, plus 3k minus 6k, which is the same thing as this over here. And then we have minus 18. And then all of that's being multiplied by 8. Now we're ready to group this thing. We can group these first two terms, they're both divisible by k. And then we can group-- let me put a positive sign-- let's group these second two terms. So then we have 8 times-- I'll write brackets here instead of drawing double parentheses. Brackets are really just parentheses that look a little bit more serious. Now let's factor out a k from this term right here. I'm going to do this in a different color. Let's factor out the k here. So this is k times k plus 3. And then we have plus. And then over here it looks like we could factor out a negative 6. So let's factor out-- I'm going to do this in a different color-- let's factor out a negative 6 over here. So plus negative 6 times k plus 3. So now it looks like we can factor out a k plus 3. There's a k plus 3 times k, and then we have a k plus 3 times the negative 6. So let's factor that out. So we have this 8 out front, that's not changing. So let me write that in the brackets. We're factoring out a k plus 3. So then we have the k plus 3 that we factored out. And then inside of that we just have left this k. Instead of writing plus negative 6, I could just write k minus 6. We factor out the k plus 3 and we're done. And then we can rewrite this. The way we wrote it here it's 8 times the product of k plus 3 times k minus 6. But we know from the properties of multiplication, this is the exact same thing as 8 times k plus 3 times k minus 6. And we are done.",math_algebra-home_alg-polynomials
" -  So what we have here is a circle with the center at Point O, and then we have a tangent line to the circle. Let me actually label this line. Let's call this Line L. And we see at Point A is the point that the tangent line intersects with the circle, and then we've drawn a radius from the center of the circle to Point A. Now what we want to do in this video is prove to ourselves that this radius and that this tangent line intersect at a right angle. We want to prove to ourselves that they intersect at a right angle. And the first step to doing that is we're going to feel good, we're going to prove to ourselves that Point A is the closest point on Line L to the center of our circle. So I want to prove, prove that Point A is closest, closest point on L to Point O. To Point O. And I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can prove that to yourself. Well, to think about that, just think about any other point on Line L. Pick any other arbitrary point on Line L. It could be this point right over here. It could be this point right over here. It could be this point right over here. And you immediately see that it sits outside of the circle. And if it's sitting outside of the circle, I'll pick this point here, just so it'll become a little bit clearer on our diagram, if it's sitting outside of the circle, in order to get from Point O to this point, I'm going to call this Point B right over here, you have to go the length of the radius, you have to go the length of the radius, and then you have to go some more. So this length, the length of Segment O B, is clearly going to be longer than the length of the radius, because you have to go to the radius to get to the circle itself and then you have to go a little bit further for any point that sits outside of the circle. So Point A is the only point, by definition this is a tangent line, it's the only point that sits on the circle. Every other point on Line L sits outside of the circle, so it's going to be further. So Point A, hopefully this makes you feel good, because you pick any other point, it's going to sit outside of the circle, so you have to go to the radius and then some. So hopefully this makes you feel good that Point A is the closest point on L to the center of the circle. Now, we're not done yet, we now have to convince ourselves that if we have a point and a line, that the segment connecting the point to the closest point on the line, to that original point, that, that's going to be perpendicular to the line. So let me give ourselves some space here. We want to prove, we want to prove that if we, that the segment, segment connecting, connecting a point off the line, off the line, and closest point on the line, closest point on the line, is perpendicular, is perpendicular to the line. So what we want to do, is we want to say, hey, if we have some line here, if we have some line here, L, and if you were to take a point off the line, so let's say, so you wanted a point off the line, so let's say that, that's this point right over here, Point O, and you want the segment connecting the point off the line to the closest point on the line. So the closest point on the line, so let's say that this is the closest point on the line, we want to feel good that this segment connecting them, so let me do this in a new color, that the segment connecting them is going to be perpendicular to the line, that it goes just straight down like that, that it's going to be perpendicular. And I'm gonna prove this by contradiction. I'm going to assume that it's not perpendicular. So assume, assume that the segment, segment connecting, connecting, this is kind of wordy, a point off line and closest point to the line, closest point to line, is not, is not perpendicular to the line. So how can I visualize that? Well, I could draw my line right over here. So that's Line L, and let's say I have my Point O right over here. Point O, and let's say the closest point on Line L to Point O, let's say that it's not, so let's say it's over here, that if I were to connect these two points, that it's not perpendicular to Line L. So this is the closest point, let's call this Point A, and let's say that the segment connecting these two is not perpendicular to the line. So let me get, so let's assume this is not perpendicular. So this angle, this angle, this angle right here, is not, is not 90 degrees. So if we assume that, the reason that this is going to be a proof by contradiction is I can show that if this is not 90 degrees, that I can always find a point that is going to be closer, another point on Line L that is going to be closer to Point O, which contradicts the fact that this was supposed to be the closest point, A was supposed to be the closest point on Line L to O. And how do I always find a closer point? Well, I construct a right triangle. I can construct a right triangle, just like this. I can construct a right triangle like that, and we see that this distance, let's call this distance right over here a, and we could call the base of this triangle b, let me do this in a different color. So a, b, that's the base of the right triangle, and the hypotenuse is the distance from O to A. We could call that c. We know from the Pythagorean Theorem that a squared plus b squared, plus b squared, let me do this, plus b squared, is going to be equal to c squared. Is going to be equal to c squared. And so b squared, if we have a non-degenerate triangle right over here, this is going to be some positive value over here, and so a is going to be less than c. So this gets us to the conclusion, because if this is some positive value here, and a and c are positive, everything are positive distances, then this tells us that a has to be less than c. That a non-hypotenuse side of a right triangle, of a non-degenerate right triangle, assuming it has some area, is going to be shorter than the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the longest side. So a is going to be less than c, which would tell us, if a is less than c, that we've found another point, let's call this point, I don't know, I've used a lot of letters here, let's call that Point D. D is going to be closer. D is closer. D is closer. So we've just set up a contradiction. We assumed A was the closest point on Line L to Point O, but we assumed the segment connecting them is not at a 90-degree angle. If it's not at a 90-degree angle, then we can drop a perpendicular and find a closer point, which is a contradiction to the fact that A was supposed to be the closer point. So this leads to a contradiction. Contradiction. Contradiction. Because you can actually find that this is not the closest point, you can always find a closer point, so therefore, the segment connecting a point off the line to the closest point to the line must be perpendicular. Must be perpendicular. So the segment connecting a point off the line, to a closest point on the line, that must be perpendicular to the line. Must be perpendicular to the line. And just like that, we hopefully feel good about the idea that if you have a radius, and the point at which it intersects a tangent line to the circle, that, that forms a 90-degree angle.

" Let's try to calculate 39.1 minus 0.794, and so pause the video and try this on your own. All right, I'm assuming you've given a go at it, so now let's work through it together. So I'm going to rewrite this. It's 39.1 minus-- I'm going to line up the decimals so that I have the right place values below the right place values-- minus-- this 0 is in the ones place, so I'll put it in the ones place-- 0.794. And now we're ready to subtract. Now, how do we subtract 4 from nothingness here, and 9 from nothingness here? Well, the same thing as nothing is a 0. And so now we can start to think about how to subtract. Well, we still have the problem. Well, we're trying to subtract 4 from 0, so we're trying to subtract 9 from 0. So what we could do is take this one tenth and try to regroup it into the hundredths place and the thousandths place. So let's think about this. If we make this-- actually that's not actually going to solve our problem. Well we could do it, but then we're going to have zero tenths, and we're still going to have a problem here. So actually let me go to the ones place. So let me get rid of a ones, so that's eight ones, which is going to be 10 tenths. So that's going to now-- we're going to have 11 tenths. The 10 tenths from here plus 1 is 11 tenths. Now let's take one of those tenths so that we have 10 tenths, and give it to the hundredths. So that's going to be 10 hundredths. And now let's take one of those hundredths-- so now we have nine hundredths-- and give it to the thousandths. So that's going to be 10 thousandths. Now we're ready to subtract. So 10-- let me do this in yellow-- 10 minus 4 is 6. 9 minus 9 is 0. 10 minus 7 is 3. We have our decimal point. 8 minus 0 is 8. And then we have 3 minus nothing is 3.

" We're asked to add 0.822 to 5.65. So let me rewrite this. And when I rewrite it, I want to line up the decimals so that we add the right place to the right place. And so we could write either number first, although I like to write the larger number first. So let's write 5.65. And remember, the important thing is that we line up the decimal points. So if we write 0.822-- so we line up the decimal. Let me line up the decimal first. So I'll write the decimal right below the other decimal. And it is 0.822. And now we are ready to add. So let's see what's going on here. So I like to start in the smallest place. That way, the carrying works out well. So you might say, wait, I need to add this 2 thousandths to something. I don't see anything up here. Well, you could say there's just a 0 thousandths right up here. Then it makes it very clear. Well, 0 thousandths plus 2 thousandths is going to be 2 thousandths. 5 hundredths plus 2 hundredths is 7 hundredths. 6 tenths plus 8 tenths is 14 tenths. Well, 14 tenths is the same thing as 4 tenths and 1 one. Another way of thinking about it is you're carrying the 1. But really, what you're saying is, look, this is 14 tenths. I could write it as 4 tenths and a 1, or a ones place, a 1 in a ones place. Then you have 1 plus 5 is 6. And of course, you cannot forget the decimal. The decimal goes right there.

" Let's talk about the cardiovascular system. Here's a cartoon of it. And we have our heart, which is the pump, which pumps blood through the blood vessels, round and round through the body. And the purpose of this whole system is to get blood out here to the capillary beds. So here's a capillary bed. And that's where the blood vessels become very skinny. And they divide. And because they're so skinny, they have a lot more surface area. And that increased surface area allows the blood to exchange its oxygen and nutrients with these cells here that I'm drawing, which need those things. So the blood gives its oxygen to these cells. And by the time it gets through the capillary bed, it's lost its own oxygen. And so now it's blue. And that blood goes back to the heart. Now, I haven't drawn it, but here also the blood goes through the lungs and gets new oxygen, so that when it goes around again, it has oxygen. So this is a closed loop, with blood going round and round and round. But it has a problem, which is that the heart needs to pump quite strong for blood to go around fast enough and feed all the cells in your body. And what that means is that the pressure that the heart exerts is very high. So there's high pressure in the heart. And there's high pressure throughout these blood vessels. And what that actually does is it forces some fluid out of your blood vessels, and especially out of these capillaries here. It forces some fluid out. And that fluid is not exactly blood, because, for example, the red blood cells which are in your blood are too big to squeeze out. But the sort of more liquidy part of your blood, which is like the plasma, that does get squeezed out. And so that's what ends up here. And that fluid mixes in with the cells which are outside of the capillaries. And it accumulates. Now, this is a problem, because if we let this go on, we would lose pretty much all of the fluid in the blood. And we would get a buildup of fluid out here. And that would be an unsustainable situation. So that's where your lymphatic system comes in. This is the problem that it addresses. So your lymphatic system is actually another plumbing system, which I'm going to try to draw here. So it's another plumbing system. It has these vessels which kind of start in the middle of nowhere. And they collect this fluid. The fluid goes in. They collect it. And they bring it back into circulation. So they bring it back into the blood. And that way, it goes back in. And the blood can continue to circulate. And we now do have a sustainable situation. So these vessels here we call lymphatic vessels. And if you'll notice, they're a little bit different from blood vessels because they don't form a closed loop. The lymph, as this stuff is called, lymph-- so that's the fluid that gets forced out of your blood. The lymph goes in here. And it gets dumped out into the blood vessels there. It doesn't go back around to the start. So that's kind of the basic explanation for why we need these lymphatic vessels. But to give it a little bit more depth, let's take one of these capillaries. And we're going to zoom in. And we're going to draw it a little bit rotated here. Hope that doesn't throw you off. These are the endothelial cells lining that capillary. And we're going to study exactly how fluid gets forced out. So as we move along this capillary, the blood is going to become deoxygenated. And so I'm drawing the changing colors. Even though, in reality, it's not the endothelial cells that are changing colors, but having these colors will help orient, I think. And so flowing through this capillary, you have little red blood cells, which I'll try to draw as little disks there. You have little red blood cells. And of course you have lots of water, a lot of water. And finally, you also have a bunch of little proteins. Some of the proteins are actually bigger than others, so we'll draw them in varying sizes. But all this stuff is present in the blood. And because of the high pressure, it gets squeezed out. So the first question is exactly where and how does it get squeezed out? And the answer is it gets through between the cells. The cells are not quite held together tightly enough to prevent stuff from getting out. But they are held tightly enough to prevent the bigger things from getting out. So the red blood cells and the bigger proteins won't get out. But what will get out is some of the fluid, some of the water, and some of the smaller proteins, which we'll draw like this. So actually, by the time the blood gets down to the latter part of the capillary, it's lost some of these smaller proteins and some of this fluid. And so let's show that by actually erasing some of it. And so the concentration of bigger proteins is higher. And you could even say that the concentration of red blood cells is a little higher. So we have a higher concentration of solutes in this part of the capillary than we had over there. And the reason why I'm mentioning this is because there's actually a subtlety, a complication here, which is that although lymph or what will soon be lymph is being forced out of the capillary over here, actually some fluid comes back into the blood vessel over here. And to understand that, you need to know that the concentration of solutes is higher here, which leads to a higher osmotic pressure pulling fluid back in. And to understand it, you also need to know that the pressure, the regular hydrostatic pressure, is lower in the latter part of the capillary compared to the earlier part. So the pressure goes down. And the pressure was what was pushing the lymph out of the blood vessel over here. So now we have less pushing out, and more pulling back in. The stuff that's pulling back in is the osmotic pressure caused by the increased concentration. So here, some of the fluid and some of the smaller proteins might get pulled back in. So now you might be confused because I said that fluid is getting pushed out, is leaking out of the blood vessels. And here I'm saying that it's leaking out but then coming back in. But the fact is that more goes out than comes back in. And so let's draw these arrows a little bigger. So more goes out than comes back in. And so net result of the blood traveling through this capillary is that you end up with lymph squeezed out. So now you know a little more detail about how and why we end up with lymph. But you might be asking yourself, why don't these cells just tighten up their connections there to prevent stuff from getting out? But the answer is, you have to remember that we have other cells around here which want to be fed. They want to get glucose and other such things from the blood. And so it's important that little glucose molecules and small proteins like hormones can get out into this space near these cells so that it can interact with them. So basically, if these endothelial cells in the capillaries were tightly connected together, then all these cells in your body would kind of be sealed off. And you might be wondering, well, are these gaps also necessary so that oxygen can get to the cells? And actually, oxygen is different. It's very small. It's just two atoms, one molecule. So oxygen can just go right through the cells. It can just travel right through walls and get where it needs to. So hopefully this gives you a better idea of how lymph is kind of formed from capillaries, how a bunch is squeezed out and only some of it gets back in. So finally, I just wanted to draw a pretty ugly human being, and make the point that you pretty much have capillaries all over your body. They're feeding all your muscles, all your different tissues. And for that reason, you need lymph vessels to take lymph away from pretty much all of your body. So you have lymph vessels coming out of your legs, coming out of your arms, and so on. And in a sense, they have a similar structure to blood vessels, which is that they start very small. And many of them come together and join up into a bigger lymph vessel. And that lymph vessel joins with another, bigger lymph vessel, and so on. And so it's kind of like they start out as capillaries, and then they merge together and get bigger and bigger. But of course they have the big difference from blood vessels, which is that they're not a closed loop. Ultimately, when they've consolidated into big lymphatic vessels, they just dump their contents back into blood circulation.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" -  At this point, you are likely already familiar with the idea of rounding. Probably, you have had some practice rounding to the nearest 10. Now we're gonna do another type of rounding. We are now going to round to the nearest 100. So let's just start with an example, and you'll see that in a lot of ways, it's very similar to rounding to the nearest 10, we're just looking at different place values now. So let's say we have the number 345. And we want to round this to the nearest 100. So pause this video, and see, I know I haven't even taught you how to do that, but what's your intuition? What is the nearest 100 to 345? Okay, now let's do this together. And what we wanna do is first look at the 100s place. And you can see 345 is three 100s, four 10s, and five ones. So 345, the 100, the number of 100s, that is right below 345 is three 100s, so it's between three 100s, zero 10s, and zero ones, and then the number of 100s that's right above this number is 400. We're in between three 100s and four 100s. And 400. So if we're gonna round this to the nearest 100, it's gonna go to one of these two. Well, to think about which one we round to, we have to think about well, is 345 closer to 400, or is it closer to 300? And to think about that, we can draw ourselves a number line. And so let me just start my number line here at, I'll just start it at 200. So that's 200, let's make this 300, and then this would be 400. And then since we, let's just see, this would be about 350 right over here, so I'll do the 50s right over there. So that 350. So where would 345 sit? Well, 345 is a little bit less than 350. It's going to be roughly right over there. So which 100 is it closer to? Are we closer to 300, or are we closer to 400? Well, you can visually see, 350 is right in between. It's 50 away from 300, and 50 away from 400. So 345 is going to be a little bit closer to 300. So in this situation, if we're rounding to the nearest 100, we would round down to 300. Now another way that you could do this, and it's very similar to what we thought about when we rounded to the nearest 10, is okay, we're rounding to the nearest 100, so this is either going to be rounded to a three or a four, and to decide on that, we go to one place value less than that. So to decide on that, we would go to the 10s place. Let me do this in a different color. Go to the 10s place. And in our 10s place right over here, if this is less than five, then we round down. If it is greater than or equal to five, we round up. So in this situation, it is less than five, so we round down. If this was 365, well then that would be greater than or equal to five, so then we would round up. And that makes sense, because 365 would be over here, and it would be closer to 400. Let's do another example. We'll do it both with what I just described, and we'll do it with a number line. And I'll actually do a four digit number now, just to just mix things up a little bit. Let's say we have the number 7,652. Pause this video, and see if you can round this number to the nearest 100. Alright, now let's do it together. Now, we're thinking about the 100s place, so right over there. You can view this as seven thousands and six 100s. Or you could even view this as 76 100s. So what are the closest 100s to this number? Well, this is, you could either view this as 76 100s and five 10s and two ones, or seven thousands, six 100s, five 10s, and two ones. And so either way, the 100s that are right below this is 76 100s, or 7,600, and the 100s that are right above this, well you would just take one more than this six, so that would be 7700, 7700. And so, which one would it round to? Well, we could use the technique that I just showed you. You go one place value less than the 100s, which in this case is in the 10s position, and you would say, alright, is this greater than or equal to five? If it is, we round up. Is this less than five? Then we round down. This is greater than or equal to five. It's equal to five. So in this situation, we round up to 7700. And we can see that on a number line as well. Let me draw a number line here. And so let me just start at, let's say that this is 7500, this is 7600, or 7,600, and this right over here is 7,700. And this would be 7,650 right over here. And so 7,652 is going to be a little bit more than that. It's going to be a little bit more. And since you can see, it's either right in the middle, or to the right of right in the middle, we would round up to 7700, which is exactly what we just did. Now let me give you another interesting example. Let's say we wanted to round to the nearest 100 for 982. What would that be? Well once again, we look at the 100s place. Well what's 100 that's right below 982? Well if you just get rid of the 82, you're just left with nine 100s, so that would be 900 if you round down. And if you were to round up, what's the 100s right above this? Well, you could go from nine 100s to 10 100s, and that would be the same thing as 1,000. And so I wanted to show this example because when you're rounding up here, the next 100 is 10 100s, or 1,000. And so we can see very clearly here that if we look at the 10s place, the eight is greater than or equal to five, so we are going to round up. So 982 rounded to the nearest 100s is 1,000.",math_in-in-class-3rd-math-cbse_imp-addition-and-subtraction
" Let's remind ourselves a little bit of what we already know about orbitals and I've gone over this early on in the regular chemistry playlist. Let's say that this is the nucleus of our atom, super small, and around that we have our first orbital, the 1s orbital. The 1s orbital, you can kind of just view it as a cloud around the nucleus. So you have your 1s orbital and it can fit two electrons, so the first electron will go into the 1s orbital and then the second electron will also go into the 1s orbital. For example, hydrogen has only one electron, so it would go into 1s. Helium has one more, so that will also go into the 1s orbital. After that is filled, then you move onto the 2s orbital. The 2s orbital, you can view it as a shell around the 1s orbital, and all of these, you can't really view it in our conventional way of thinking. You can kind of view it as a probability cloud of where you might find the electrons. But for visualization purposes, just imagine it's kind of a shell cloud around the 1s orbital. So imagine that it's kind of a fuzzy shell around the 1s orbital, so it's around the 1s orbital, and your next electron will go there. Then the fourth electron will also go there, and I drew these arrows upward and downward because the first electron that goes into the 1s orbital has one spin and then the next electron to go into 1s orbital will have the opposite spin, and so they keep pairing up in that way. They have opposite spins. Now, if we keep adding electrons, now we move to the 2p orbitals. Actually, you can view it as there are three 2p orbitals and each of them can hold two electrons, so it can hold a total of six electrons in the 2p orbitals. Let me draw them for you just so you can visualize it. So if we were to label our axis here, so think in three dimensions. So imagine that that right there is the x-axis. Let me do this in different colors. Let's say that this right here is our y-axis and then we have a z-axis. I'll do that in blue. Let's say we have a z-axis just like that. You actually have a p orbital that goes along each of those axes. So you could have your two-- let me do it in the same color. So you have your 2p sub x orbital, and so what that'll look like is a dumbbell shape that's going in the x-direction. So let me try my best attempt at drawing this. It's a dumbbell shape that goes in the x-direction, in kind of both directions, and it's actually symmetric. I'm drawing this end bigger than that end so it looks like it's coming out at you a little bit, but let me draw it a little bit better than that. I can do a better job. And maybe it comes out like that. Remember, these are really just probability clouds, but it's helpful to kind of visualize them as maybe a little bit more things that we would see in our world, but I think probability cloud is the best way to think about it. So that is the 2px orbital, and then I haven't talked about how they get filled yet, but then you also have your 2py orbital, which'll go in this axis, but same idea, kind of a dumbbell shape in the y-direction, going in both along the y-axis, going in that direction and in that direction. Then, of course, so let me do this 2py, and then you also have your 2pz, and that goes in the z-direction up like that and then downwards like that. So when you keep adding electrons, the first-- so far, we've added four electrons. If you add a fifth electron, you would expect it to go into the 2px orbital right there. So even though this 2px orbital can fit two electrons, the first one goes there. The very next one won't go into that one. It actually wants to separate itself within the p orbital, so the very next electron that you add won't go into 2px, it'll go into 2py. And then the one after that won't go into 2py or 2px, it'll go into 2pz. They try to separate themselves. Then if you add another electron, if you add-- let's see, we've added one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. If you add an eighth electron, that will then go into the 2px orbital, so the eighth electron would go there, but it would have the opposite spin. So this is just a little bit of review with a little bit of visualization. Now, given what we just reviewed, let's think about what's happening with carbon. Carbon has six electrons. Its electron configuration, it is 1s2, two electrons in the 1s orbital. Then 2s2, then 2p2, right? It only has two left, because it has a total of six electrons. Two go here, then there, then two are left to fill the p orbitals. If you go based on what we just drew and what we just talked about here, what you would expect for carbon-- let me just draw it out the way I did this. So you have your 1s orbital, your 2s orbital, and then you have your 2px orbital, your 2py orbital, and then you have your 2pz orbital. If you just go straight from the electron configuration, you would expect carbon, so the 1s orbital fills first, so that's our first electron, our second electron, our third electron. Then we go to our 2s orbital, That fills next, third electron, then fourth electron. Then you would expect maybe your fifth electron to go in the 2px. We could have said 2py or 2z. It just depends on how you label the axis. But you would have your fifth electron go into one of the p orbitals, and then you would expect your sixth to go into another. So you would expect that to be kind of the configuration for carbon. And if we were to draw it-- let me draw our axes. That is our y-axis and then this is our x-axis. Let me draw it a little bit better than that. So that is the x-axis and, of course, you have your z-axis. You have to think in three dimensions a little bit. Then you have your z-axis, just like that. So first we fill the 1s orbital, so if our nucleus is sitting here, our 1s orbital gets filled with two electrons. You can imagine that as a little cloud around the nucleus. Then we fill the 2s orbital and that would be a cloud around that, kind of a shell around that. Then we would put one electron in the 2px orbital, so one electron would start kind of jumping around or moving around, depending how you want to think about it, in that orbital over there, 2px. Then you'd have the next electron jumping around or moving around in the 2py orbital, so it would be moving around like this. If you went just off of this, you would say, you know what? These guys, this guy over here and that guy over there is lonely. He's looking for a opposite spin partner. This would be the only places that bonds would form. You would expect some type of bonding to form with the x-orbitals or the y-orbitals. Now, that's what you would expect if you just straight-up kind of stayed with this model of how things fill and how orbitals look. The reality of carbon, and I guess the simplest reality of carbon, is if you look at a methane molecule, is very different than what you would expect here. First of all, what you would expect here is that carbon would probably-- maybe it would form two bonds. But we know carbon forms four bonds and it wants to pretend like it has eight electrons. Frankly, almost every atom wants to pretend like it has eight electrons. So in order for that to happen, you have to think about a different reality. This isn't really what's happening when carbon bonds, so not what happens when carbon bonds. What's really happening when carbon bonds, and this will kind of go into the discussion of sp3 hybridization, but what you're going to see is it's not that complicated of a topic. It sounds very daunting, but it's actually pretty straightforward. What really happens when carbon bonds, because it wants to form four bonds with things, is its configuration, you could imagine, looks more like this. So you have 1s. We have two electrons there. Then you have your 2s, 2px, 2py and 2pz. Now what you can imagine is it wants to form four bonds. It has four electrons that are willing to pair up with electrons from other molecules. In the case of methane, that other molecule is a hydrogen. So what you could imagine is that the electrons actually-- maybe the hydrogen brings this electron right here into a higher energy state and puts it into 2z. That's one way to visualize it. So this other guy here maybe ends up over there, and then these two guys are over there and over there. Now, all of a sudden, it looks like you have four lonely guys and they are ready to bond, and that's actually more accurate of how carbon bonds. It likes to bond with four other people. Now, it's a little bit arbitrary which electron ends up in each of these things, and even if you had this type of bonding, you would expect things to bond along the x, y, and z axis. The reality is, the reality of carbon, is that these four 1electrons in its second shell don't look like they're in 1just-- the first one doesn't look like it's just in the s 1orbital and then the p and y and z for the other three. 1They all look like they're a little bit in the s and a 1little bit in the p orbitals. 1Let me make that clear. 1So instead of this being a 2s, what it really looks like for 1carbon is that this looks like a 2sp3 orbital. 1This looks like a 2sp3 orbital, that looks like a 12sp3 orbital, that looks like a 2sp3 orbital. 1They all look like they're kind of in the same orbital. 1This special type of-- it sounds very fancy. 1This sp3 hybridized orbital, what it actually looks like is 1something that's in between an s and a p orbital. 1It has a 25% s nature and a 75% p nature. 1You can imagine it as being a mixture of these four things. 1That's the behavior that carbon has. 1So when you mix them all, instead of having an s 1orbital, so if this is a nucleus and we do a 1cross-section, an s orbital looks like that and the p 1orbital looks something like that in cross-section. 1So this is a an s and that is a p. 1When they get mixed up, the orbital looks like this. 1An sp3 orbital looks something like this. 1This is a hybridized sp3 orbital. 1Hybrid just means a combination of two things. 1A hybrid car is a combination of gas and electric. 1A hybridized orbital is a combination of s and p. 1Hybridized sp3 orbitals are the orbitals when carbon bonds 1with things like hydrogen or really when 1it bonds with anything. 1So if you looked at a molecule of methane, and people talk 1about sp3 hybridized orbitals, all they're saying is that you 1have a carbon in the center. 1Let's say that's the carbon nucleus right there. 1And instead of having one s and three p orbitals, it has 1four sp3 orbitals. 1So let me try my best at drawing the four sp3 orbitals. 1Let's say this is the big lobe that is kind of pointing near 1us, and then it has a small lobe in the back. 1Then you have another one that has a big lobe like that and a 1small lobe in the back. 1Then you have one that's going back behind the page, so let 1me draw that. 1You can kind of imagine a three-legged stool, and then 1its small lobe will come out like that. 1And then you have one where the big lobe is pointing 1straight up, and it has a small lobe going down. 1You can imagine it as kind of a three-legged stool. 1One of them is behind like that and it's pointing 1straight up, So a three-legged stool with something-- it's 1kind of like a tripod, I guess is the best way 1to think about it. 1So that's the carbon nucleus in the center and then you 1have the hydrogens, so that's our carbon right there. 1Then you have your hydrogens. 1You have a hydrogen here. 1A hydrogen just has one electron in the 1s orbital, so 1the hydrogen has a 1s orbital. 1You have a hydrogen here that just has a 1s orbital. 1It has a hydrogen here, 1s orbital, 1hydrogen here, 1s orbital. 1So this is how the hydrogen orbital and the carbon 1orbitals get mixed. 1The hydrogens 1s orbital bonds with-- well, each of the 1hydrogen's 1s orbital bonds with each of the 1carbon's sp3 orbitals. 1Just so you get a little bit more notation, so when people 1talk about hybridized sp3 orbitals, all they're saying 1is, look, carbon doesn't bond. 1Once carbon-- this right here is a 1molecule of methane, right? 1This is CH4, or methane, and it doesn't bond like you would 1expect if you just want with straight 1vanilla s and p orbitals. 1If you just went with straight vanilla s and p orbitals, the 1bonds would form. 1Maybe the hydrogen might be there and there, and if it had 1four hydrogens, maybe there and there, depending on how 1you want to think about it. 1But the reality is it doesn't look like that. 1It looks more like a tripod. 1It has a tetrahedral shape. 1The best way that that can be explained, I guess the shape 1of the structure, is if you have four equally-- four of 1the same types of orbital shapes, and those four types 1of orbital shapes are hybrids between s's and p's. 1One other piece of notation to know, sometimes people think 1it's a very fancy term, but when you have a bond between 1two molecules, where the orbitals are kind of pointing 1at each other, so you can imagine right here, this 1hydrogen orbital is pointing in that direction. 1This sp3 orbital is pointing that direction, and they're 1overlapping right around here. 1This is called a sigma bond, where the overlap is along the 1same axis as if you connected the two molecules. 1Over here, you connect the two molecules, the overlap is on 1that same axis. 1This is the strongest form of covalent bonds, and this'll be 1a good basis for discussion maybe in the next video when 1we talk a little bit about pi bonds. 1The big takeaway of this video is to just understand what 1does it mean? 1What is an sp3 hybridized orbital? 1Nothing fancy, just a 1combination of s and p orbitals. 1It has 25% s character, 75% p character, which makes sense. 1It's what exists when carbon forms bonds, especially in the 1case of methane. 1That's what describes it's tetrahedral structure. 1That's why we have an angle between the various branches 1of a 109.5 degrees, which some teachers might want you know, 1so it's useful to know. 1If you take this angle right here, 109.5, that's the same 1thing as that angle, or if you were to go behind it, that 1angle right there, 109.5 degrees, explained by sp3 1hybridization. 1The bonds themselves are sigma bonds. 1The overlap is along the axis connecting the hydrogen.",science_organic-chemistry_gen-chem-review
" -  Now, one of the main functions that bone performs is as a storage source of calcium. So now you know why your mom told you that you needed plenty of calcium, probably in the form of a tall glass of cold milk, so that you could form strong bones. So calcium homeostasis, or, the flow of calcium between the blood stream and bone is actually under endocrine or hormonal control. And these hormones, these endocrine hormones actually alter the ratio of osteoclast activity to osteoblast activity. So as osteoclast activity increases relatively to osteoblast activity, there is an increase in the liberation of calcium and phosphate from bone into the blood stream. And remember that osteoclasts cause bones to crash. So they take the calcium and phosphate from bone and put it into the blood stream. The opposite is true if this ratio reverses. As the activity of osteoblasts increase, you get calcium and phosphate going from the blood stream back into bone. So that's the gist for calcium homeostasis. Now what are the main players, the hormones that are responsible for maintaining this calcium homeostasis, this balance between calcium and phosphate in the blood stream and calcium and phosphate in the bone? Well, the main players are parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and a third hormone called calcitriol, which is really just the active form of vitamin D. These hormones basically help to regulate the amount of calcium that is either absorbed from the gut or reabsorbed from the kidneys. And they also affect the level of activity, or this ratio, of osteoclast to osteoblast activity. Parathyroid hormone, or P-T-H, and calcitriol have the same overall effect of increasing calcium and phosphate in the blood, with calcitonin having the opposite effect. It decreases the amount of calcium and phosphate in the blood. And the way I remember this is that calcitonin actually tones down the calcium in blood. And so, as you can see, there couple of general themes here. The first being that each time calcium increases in the blood, you have a concurrent increase of phosphate. They kind of go together. They're buddies. And the same thing for if calcium decreases in the blood, phosphate will decrease. The other thing to kind of keep in mind is that, as calcium or phosphate increases in the blood, there is a concurrent decrease of these two ions in bone. It has to be coming from the bone if it's going to be increasing in the blood. And the opposite is true for whenever calcium and phosphate is decreasing from the bloodstream. It's decreasing because it's being placed back into bone, deposited in the form of bone. So one thing that I think would be particularly helpful is if we draw out a table and go through how each of these hormones affects the cellular activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and also calcium absorption from either the intestines or the kidneys. So here, going 'cross the table, we'll put parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and calcitriol. And then we'll put each of the things that is affected by the various levels of these different endocrine players. Osteoblast activity, we'll put osteoclast activity, and then intestinal or renal absorption of calcium. So first, let's look at osteoblast activity. Recall that osteoblasts build up bone. As their activity increases, you have calcium and phosphate taken from the blood stream and deposited into bone. Now keeping that in mind, and also realizing that parathyroid hormone helps to increase calcium and phosphate in the blood, in other words, it breaks down bone to put calcium phosphate in the blood, we would expect osteoblast activity to decrease as parathyroid hormone increases. So that's the effect parathyroid hormone has on osteoblast activity. It decreases it. And calcitriol, remember, has the same overall effect that parathyroid hormone has. It increases calcium and phosphate in the blood by taking it from bone. So as calcitriol increases, you would expect osteoblast activity, the activity of building bone, to decrease because you're taking calcium and phosphate from the bone and putting it in the blood. Calcitonin, on the other hand, remember, tones down calcium and phosphate in the blood. It takes these ions and puts it back into bone. And so, as calcitonin increases, we would expect osteoblast activity to increase. Because more bone is being formed from calcium and phosphate being taken from the blood. And you'll see this theme of parathyroid hormone and calcitriol having the same effect on either osteoblast activity, osteoclast activity, or the absorption of calcium because they have the same effect of increasing calcium and phosphate in the blood. So next, let's go to osteoclast activity. This is basically going to be the opposite of whatever osteoblast activity is. Because remember osteoclasts crash down bone. They take the calcium and phosphate and put it back into the blood stream. And remember that parathyroid hormone stimulates this process. So the effect of parathyroid hormone on osteoclast activity is to increase it. And likewise, calcitriol is going to increase osteoclast activity. And then calcitonin, because it decreases calcium and phosphate being put into the blood stream, is going to decrease this osteoclast activity. So now we're on to intestinal and renal, or kidney, calcium absorption. Knowing that parathyroid hormone leads to an increase in calcium and phosphate in the blood, we would expect parathyroid hormone to lead to an increase in the ability of the intestines and kidneys to absorb calcium. And we know that calcitriol has this same effect. Calcitonin, on the other hand, we remember tones down calcium in the blood, so we would expect calcitonin to decrease the rate of calcium absorption via the intestines and in the kidneys. So why does the concentration of free calcium ions in the blood matter so much? Why does our body have this elaborate system of calcium homeostasis with these various hormones, and altering the concentrations of calcium and phosphate between the blood stream and bone? Well, the concentration of calcium ions in the blood actually has very important physiological effects. So, for example, too much calcium actually leads to hypoexcitable cell membranes. And this results in lethargy, fatigue, and memory loss. Whereas, too little calcium in the blood actually leads to muscle cramps and convulsions. So, as you can see, the endocrine system plays a pretty critical role in calcium homeostasis through its effect on bone remodeling and its effect on calcium absorption.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" Narrator: Let's say you've got two people and one person has Tuberculosis, that's this person over here, I'll call him person A and another person does not, this is person B over here. What are the things that are going to make person A more infectious? What are the things we need to think about, in terms of how likely it is that person B will actually get sick with TB. There are a few things. We know that this person has to actually cough out some TB particles, right? They're going to cough them out and that means that the strength of the cough, let's say they have a real good cough like that, versus a really weak, kind of puny cough, something like that is going to matter. It turns out that the folks that have the strongest cough are the adults. So, any adults, in general, adults are going to have a much stronger cough than children. So, that means that adults are more infectious than children. Let me actually write that as my first key point. It turns out that's exactly right, that we see that in terms of spreading TB, it's the adults that spread it much more than kids and definitely much more than infants. A second point, is that you need live bacteria. This seems obvious that of course you're not going to get anyone sick if you don't have live bacteria. The way to know that someone has live bacteria, you can actually just take some of there sputum or some of their mucus from their lungs and look under a microscope and you would actually see what we call a positive smear. That literally means you smear out the mucus under a microscope and you look with a microscope and you can literally see the TB bacteria. You can also do a culture and see if you can actually grow the bacteria. If you can see the bacteria or grow the bacteria, that's a good indication that there's live TB bacteria there and that's obviously going to make the person more infectious as well. A third point, is if you look in their lungs and you see large cavities, some times you call that cavitary disease, but let me just write cavity here. If you see a cavity there, in that cavity we know is going to be full of little TB bacteria. Those cavities are classic for that and so whenever you see or think about cavities, I want you to remember that the folks that get cavities are the secondary progressive disease folks. Remember there's primary and there's secondary, and it's the secondary progressive disease that causes these cavities. These are the folks that are going to be more infectious because they're loaded with live TB bacteria. What are the things we can do to actually prevent the spread of TB? The first one is actually kind of obvious, it's medication. We have medications that are really good for treating Tuberculosis. One classic thing that we've done is what we call directly observe therapy, DOT, directly observe therapy. All that means is sometimes a physician or a nurse will actually watch a patient take their medications so that they don't forget or sometimes people don't like to take their medications. This is an easy way to make sure that someone's actually taking their medications. We call it DOT. That's obviously going to be helpful for killing off the bacteria, so we don't have to worry about live bacteria anymore. Usually that happens in about two weeks, after two weeks of medications, that usually kills off the bacteria so you no longer have those positive smears and positive cultures. It also helps with symptoms, so if you're not sick with TB you may not be coughing as much. That's another important thing to keep in mind. What else would be important? You could imagine, isolation, making sure the person is actually isolated. So, isolation is key. And specifically you want to make sure they're not around any young people, so definitely don't want them around anyone under the age of four years because, of course, children are really, really susceptible to getting very sick with TB, so you want to make sure they're away from young children and you want to keep them isolated at night. So, at night when they're sleeping - I put a little @ symbol, but at night when they're sleeping you want to make sure that they're isolated and maybe sleeping in their own room. Of course it's ideal if the person is completely isolated, but of course that's not always practical because they might be with their family or their children, but you want to make sure that they're at least away from children under four and at night that they are sleeping alone. Another thing is a surgical mask. A surgical mask is really good because it helps prevent too much of the stuff that's coming out of your mouth to enter the air. Actually, literally, let me just draw it for you. It literally catches a lot of this stuff and prevents it from entering the space around you. This is a mask, let's say a surgical mask, it might hook up like this, maybe like that, and what it does is it literally catches the stuff that's coming out of the mouth and makes it ricochet back in. You can still breath with a surgical mask on, but it just keeps the large particles, maybe large droplets from leaving your mouth. Now, what if you're person B, what's one thing you could do if you're person B? One obvious trick is just standing further away, you don't have to stand so close to person A, you can stand all the way back here. That's going to make it less likely that you're going to get sick with TB. Let me write that here, is create space, create space. Another key idea is, think about what happens when someone passes gas, or there's a horrible smell in a room, what are you going to do? Usually people are going to find the door, maybe they'll open the door and let some air in. This arrow indicates more air coming in. Maybe there's a window here, they're going to open the window and let the breeze come in. Basically do whatever you can to dilute out that horrible smell. If there's a fan, maybe you'll try to turn on the fan and get that spinning. If you can get the fan going that's also going to move around the air. You're just trying to move around the air to get a dilution of that horrible smell. Let me right it out, dilute. The idea here is that you can just literally do simple things. You can open up doors and windows, we call that natural ventilation. You can also turn on a fan to kind of move the air around and you're just trying to dilute out that horrible bacteria so that less of it is likely to enter your lungs. Another thing you can do is actually put on an air purifying respirator. An air purifying respirator is actually a little bit different then the surgical mask. This one is actually going to keep out very tiny, tiny particles. Unlike the surgical mask whick gets the large things, spit and large particles, this one is actually going to capture very tiny particles and it's actually not going to allow them into your breathing area, your airway. It's actually going to make things bounce off, essentially, or get caught inside the filter itself. It wont allow TB particles into your nose or mouth. A common one here, you might have heard of or seen, is called the N95. There are many other types as well, but that's one example of an air purifying respirator. There are a couple more things that you might see that are slightly more expensive, but you might come across them or at least hear about them. One is called ultraviolet, (writing) ultraviolet germicidal. Let's see if you can kind of guess how this works or what it does. (writing) Germicidal, cidal means killing something. Germicidal irradiation, irradiation. A lot of times people will just shorten this whole thing to UVGI. They'll say a UVGI was installed and what UVGI does, it literally takes ultraviolet light and shines it out, and actually if there area couple of TB particles, let's say one here and one here, that UVGI, that irradiation kills that TB particle and X's it out. So, it's no longer alive and the folks in that room are safe. The final thing I want to talk about is called a HEPA filter. It's a filter and if I was to draw the ceiling it would look something like this. Maybe it has some spot on the ceiling where air is flowing in and some spot where air is flowing out. Just erase these parts right here and I'll show you. Let's say that air is coming in this way, let's say three arrows, and you've got air coming out this way, you've got three arrows. So in the middle, somewhere in this area you've got a filter. This filter is going to catch TB particles, so we call it a High Efficiency Particulate Air Filter. (writing) Particulate Air Filter. No one wants to say all of this because it's too long, so just for short, again they say HEPA filter. A HEPA filter is going to then catch some TB particles that are going to flow in and they're going to get stuck in these filters, so coming out on the other side you have nice clean air because the TB particle will not get through that filter. You could even take this a step further. You could say well, how about if we did this and actually, instead of having all of the air returned, let's say we return just part of it and actually allow some of the air to escape outside of our room. Now you have a negative pressure in this room because you have more air 1leaving the room then is re-entering the room, you have negative pressure, 1almost like a vacuum because all this air is going up into the filter 1and not as much is coming back out, so this room becomes negative pressure. 1There's kind of a vacuum in this room and especially if you do it right. 1If you close off all these doors and you close these windows, 1then you definitely create a negative pressure. 1What that means is that now you can really protect the area around 1because you close off the door, you close off the window 1and now there's no way that a TB particle can leave and go into the hallway 1because if there's a little bit of a gap underneath this door, if that's the only crack in this room, 1then the negative pressure is going to make air flow through that crack 1into the room instead of air flowing out into the hallway. 1That's actually another key trick that they use to prevent TB from spreading, 1is they'll create a negative pressure where they pump air out, 1which is what we showed here, and then they'll seal off the whole room, 1and then the air from the hallway starts entering the room 1and you can make sure that no TB particles are going to get out into the hallway 1and get people in the hallway sick.",science_health-and-medicine_infectious-diseases
" -  So we're given four different equations here and each of them have a blank, and we need to fill in that blank with a missing number. So let's do each of these. So on the left hand side of this equation, we have one plus four, so one plus four is the same thing as... Well, one plus four is five. If we take four, and if you add one more, you're gonna have five. So now, we finished that one, because one plus four is the same thing as five. Now here, we're saying four plus something is the same thing as five. Well, we just figured out that one plus four, or four plus one is the same thing as five. So four plus one is five. So notice there, we have the equation, four plus one is the same thing as five. Equals means that what's on the left is the same thing as what you have on the right. Now we have blank plus two is equal to five. So what plus two is the same thing as five? Well, three plus two is equal to five, or five is equal to three plus two. Now you go here. Well now you have three plus blank is equal to five. Well, we already figured it out, because three plus two is equal to five. So we can write three plus two is equal to five, and then we can check ourselves. And then we can keep going. So now we have some subtraction. So what's the same thing as nine minus three? So if I have nine things, and if I were to take away three of them, I'm going to have six left. Nine minus three is the same thing as six. 10 minus blank is equal to six. So what do I have to take away from 10 in order to have six left over? Well, if I take four away from 10, I'm going to have six left over. Now something minus one is the same thing as six. Well, seven minus one is going to be equal to six. And then we get eight minus blank is equal to six. So how many do I have to take away from eight in order to get to six? Well, if I take away one, I'm going to get seven. If I take away two, I'm going to have six. So eight minus two is equal to six.",math_early-math_cc-early-math-add-sub-basics
" -  So we're given this expression is the Taylor series about zero for which of the following functions and they give us some choices here. So let's just think a little bit about this series that they gave us. So if we were to expand it out, let's see, when n is equal to zero, it'd be negative one to the zero power which is one times x to the zero which is one over zero factorial which is one so it'll be one plus and then when n is one, well then this is going to be negative so it's going to be minus and then x to the first over one factorial over, well, I could just write that as x over here and then when n is two, the negative one squared, that's gonna be positive x squared over two and there's going to be minus x to the third over three factorial and then it's going to be plus and I can keep going. You've seen this before. x to the fourth over four factorial and it's gonna keep going. Minus, plus. It's going to keep alternating on and on and on. Now, our general form for a Taylor series about zero which we could also call a Maclaurin series would be, our general form would be f of zero plus f prime of zero times x plus f prime prime of zero times x squared over two plus the the third derivative at zero times x to the third over three factorial plus the fourth derivative, you get the idea, evaluated at zero times x to the fourth over four factorial and we would just go on and on and on. Now, to figure out which function, in order what I wrote in blue to be the Maclaurin or to be the Taylor series about zero or in order to be the Maclaurin series, that means that, that means that f of zero needs to be equal to one. It means that f prime of zero, actually let me write this down. It means that f of zero needs to be equal to one. f of zero is equal to one. It means that f prime of zero needs to be the coefficient on the x here which is negative one and we could keep going. It means that, it means that the second derivative at zero, well, that's going to be the coefficient on this x squared over two so that's gotta be equal to one and you see the general idea that the third derivative at zero is equal to negative one. It's the coefficient on the x to the third over three factorial which is negative one right over here. And so just using this information can we figure out which of these it is. So you could do a little bit of deductive reasoning here. Let's evaluate all of these functions at zero and see which of these are one. So sine of zero. Well, that's zero. Just by looking at this first constraint, sine of zero isn't one. We can rule that out. Cosine of zero is one so that's still in the running. e to the zero is one. e to the zero is one and then the natural log of one plus zero, that's the natural log of one which is a zero so that's out of the running. So just from that first constraint knowing that f of zero is equal to one, we're able to rule out two of the choices then knowing that the first derivative evaluated at zero is going to be negative one but what's the first derivative of cosine of x? Well, it's the negative sine of x. If we evaluate that at zero, we're not gonna get negative one. We're gonna get zero so we can rule this out. Now, the first derivative of e to the x is e to the x. If we evaluate that at zero, we're gonna get one, not negative one so we can rule that out. And so not even looking at anything else, we have a pretty good sense that D is probably our answer but we could check. The first derivative here, f prime of x here is going to be negative e to the negative x. So f prime of zero is going to be, is going to be negative e to the zero or negative one so it meets that one and if you were curious, you could keep going and see that it meets all the other constraints but choice D is the only one that meets even the first two constraints for the function at zero and the first derivative at zero.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-series
" -  Let's say that you have an infinite series, S, which is equal to the sum from n equals one, let me write that a little bit neater. n equals one to infinity of a sub n. This is all a little bit of review. We would say, well this is the same thing as a sub one, plus a sub two, plus a sub three, and we would just keep going on and on and on forever. Now what I want to introduce to you is the idea of a partial sum. This right over here is an infinite series. But we can define a partial sum, so if we say S sub six, this notation says, okay, if S is an infinite series, S sub six is the partial sum of the first six terms. So in this case, this is going to be we're not going to just keep going on forever, this is going to be a sub one, plus a sub two, plus a sub three, plus a sub four, plus a sub five, plus a sub six. And I can make this a little bit more tangible if you like. So let's say that S, the infinite series S, is equal to the sum from n equals one, to infinity of one over n squared. In this case it would be one over one squared, plus one over two squared, plus one over three squared, and we would just keep going on and on and on forever. But what would S sub -- I should do that in that same color. What would S -- I said I would change color, and I didn't. What would S sub three be equal to? The partial sum of the first three terms, and I encourage you to pause the video and try to work through it on your own. Well, it's just going to be the first term one, plus the second term, 1/4, plus the third term, 1/9, is going to be the sum of the first three terms, and we can figure that out, that's to see if you have a common denominator here, it's going to be 36. It's going to be 36/36, plus 9/36, plus 4/36, so this is going to be 49/36. 49/36. So the whole point of this video, is just to appreciate this idea of a partial sum. And what we'll see is, that you can actually express what a partial sum might be algebraically. So for example, for example, let's give ourselves a little bit more real estate here. Let's say, let's go back to just saying we have an infinite series, S, that is equal to the sum from n equals one to infinity of a sub n. And let's say we know the partial sum, S sub n, so the sum of the first n terms of this is equal to n squared minus three over n to the third plus four. So just as a bit of a reminder of what this is saying. S sub n... S sub n is the same thing as a sub one, plus a sub two, plus you keep going all the way to a sub n, and that's going to be equal to this business, n squared minus three over n to the third plus four. Now, given that, if someone were to walk up to you on the street and say, okay now that you know the notation for a partial sum, I have a little question to ask of you. If S is the infinite series, and I'm writing it in very general terms right over here, so S is the infinite series from n equals one to infinity of a sub n, and the partial sum, S sub n, is defined this way, so someone, they tell you these two things, and then they say find what the sum from n equals one to six of a sub n is, and I encourage you to pause the video and try to figure it out. Well, this is just going to be a sub one, plus a sub two, plus a sub three, plus a sub four, and when I say sub that just means subscript, plus a sub five, plus a sub six, well that's just the same thing as the partial sum, this is just the same thing as the partial sum of the first six terms for our infinite series. It's just going to be the partial sum S sub six. And we know how to algebraically evaluate what S sub six is. We can apply this formula that we were given. S sub six is equal to, well, everywhere we see an n, we replaced with a six, it's going to be six squared minus three over six to the third plus four, so what is this going to be? Six squared is 36 minus three, so that's 33, and six to the third, let's see, 36 times six, I always forget, my brain wants to say 216, but let me make sure that that's actually the case. Six times 30 is 180, plus 36, yes, it is 216, so I guess I have, inadvertently, by seeing six to the third so many times in my life, I have inadvertently memorized six to the third power, never a horrible thing to have that in your brain. So this is going to be 216 plus four, so 220. So, S sub six, or the sum of the first six terms of the series right over here, is 33/220, and we're done. And the whole point of this is just so you kind of appreciate, or really do appreciate this partial sum notation, and understand what it really means.",math_calculus-2_cs2-series
" The circle x squared plus y squared minus 8x equals 0, and the hyperbola x squared over 9 minus y squared over 4 equal 1 intersect at the points A and B. Equation of a common tangent with positive slope to the circle as well so the hyperbola is-- so let's just visualize what they're asking first. And this is going to take us multiple videos, I have a feeling. But let's just visualize it just so we can get our head around the problem. So this circle, let me complete the square in terms of x. So this circle, as they wrote it, is x squared minus 8x. And then we have a plus y squared-- I left some space here so we can complete the square-- is equal to 0. And then let me add half of this 8 term squared to both sides. So half of negative 8 is negative 4, and negative 4 squared is 16. So add 16 to both sides. And that allowed me to turn the x-term into a perfect square. This is the same thing as x minus 4 squared. And then we have plus y squared. Plus y squared is equal to 16. So this is a circle. This right here is a circle with center at x equals 4. At x equals 4, y is equal to 0. And it has a radius of 4 as well. So let me graph this circle here. So let me draw the horizontal axis, my x-axis. Let me draw the y-axis. That is my y-axis over here. And let me draw its center, so 1, 2, 3, 4. 4 comma 0. That's it's center, and it has a radius of 4. So it's going to come out, and it's going to look something-- I could draw a better circle than that. It's going to look something like-- that's the top half, and then the bottom half is going to look something like that. So that's our circle. Now let's think about the hyperbola. So if we just look at it, the x squared term is positive, so it's going to be a hyperbola that opens to the right and the left. We do this a bunch in the conic sections videos if you want to review of that. And we could just figure out where it intersects the x-axis. So then when y is equal to 0, we have x squared over 9 must be equal to 1. Or x would be plus or minus 3. So the hyperbola is going to look like this. So this is at plus 3 comma 0. The hyperbola will open up like that. And then at 1, 2, 3, negative 3 comma 0, the hyperbola is going to open up to the left. And so in the problem when they describe the points A and B, they're probably talking about that point A and that point B. Now, let's think about what this question is asking us. Equation of a common tangent with positive slope-- so it has to have a positive slope-- to the circle as well as to the hyperbola-- a common tangent. So let's just think about this a little bit. So it's going to have a positive slope, so it won't be tangent to the circle anywhere where the circle has a negative slope. So it can't be tangent over here. It can't be tangent over there. And then we could say, well, if it was tangent to the circle over here, what would happen? Well , it wouldn't be able to be tangent to the hyperbola. So it has to be tangent to the circle someplace in this blue region right over here. And then how can it be tangent to the hyperbola? It might be tempting to say that it would be tangent to the hyperbola in this way somehow, but what you need to realize is the hyperbola is asymptoting towards some line. And we could figure out what that line is. Its asymptoting towards some line. So let me draw that line. The hyperbola is always going to have a higher slope than that line, a very slightly higher slope. It's slowly approaching that line. So if you go out here, the hyperbola is going to have a higher slope than the asymptote line. And so if you had to be tangent to it, you would have to have a higher slope. And anything that's coming from this part of the circle towards anything out here on the hyperbola is going to have to have a lower slope than the tangent line, right? Because it's going to have to catch up. The tangent line is going to have to catch up to whatever-- let me draw it again-- to whatever we draw over here. I want to make this clear. The hyperbola, as you go out here, actually this whole period, this whole part of the hyperbola, is going to have a higher slope than what it is asymptoting towards. That's what allows it to get closer and closer to that line. So any tangent is going to have to have a higher slope out here. Anything tangent to the hyperbola is going to have to have a higher slope than this actual line. It's going to have to have a slightly higher slope. So if we take something out here and we try to draw a tangent from this part of the circle out there, it wouldn't work. Because this tangent, by definition, in order to meet the hyperbola, is going to have to have a lower slope than this asymptote. So this can't be tangent to that part of the hyperbola. So what else can we do? Well, the only other part of the hyperbola that we might be able to work something out is this part of the hyperbola right over here. So if we find a line that's tangent maybe there and there on the hyperbola, then we might have found our common tangent with positive slope. So let me draw that. So our common tangent with positive slope, I'll do that in pink. Our common tangent with positive slope could look like that. So now that we have the visualization down, in the next video let's try to figure out what that line might look like, especially when we constrain it to having to be tangent to the circle and having to be tangent to this hyperbola.",math_precalculus_conics
"  In the last video, we learned that 380,000 years after the Big Bang, which is still roughly 13.7 billion years ago, every point-- I shouldn't say every point-- every atom in space that was kind of at this roughly 3,000 Kelvin temperature was emitting this electromagnetic radiation. Since every point in space was, there were points in space, or there was points in the universe, that that radiation is only just now reaching us. It has been traveling for 13.7 billion years. So when we look at radiation that's been traveling for that long, we can look at any direction and we'll see this uniform radiation. And that radiation has been red-shifted into the microwave range from the higher frequencies that it was actually emitted at. Now, a question that might pop in your brain is, well, what happens if we wait a billion years? Because if we wait a billion years, if we have 1,000,380,000 years after the beginning of the universe, this stuff won't just be atoms anymore. It will have started to condense into actual stars. The universe at every point in space will no longer be this uniform. We'll actually start having condensation into stars. So if we move forward a little bit, the universe will expand. Maybe I'll just draw a half of it since it's expanded. It's obviously expanded much more. But now all of a sudden, we actually have stars. These are no longer just uniform atoms spread through the universe. We actually have condensation into stars. And so if you look at what is being emitted from the points in space from which we're only now getting this cosmic background radiation, if we wait a billion years, the light that we see from those points in space will not look like this uniform radiation. It'll start to look a little bit more like the more mature parts of the universe. We'll essentially be looking at the universe a billion years after the Big Bang, when stars have formed, other structures have formed. So the question is in a billion years, will this cosmic microwave background radiation disappear. And I'm using billion just to arbitrarily use a number. But will it eventually disappear? And the answer to that is yes and no. So to think about it, it is true that this point in space will mature. It will mature in a billion years. It will no longer be this uniform-- I guess this uniform haze of hot hydrogen atoms. But what you have to think about is there were further points in the universe.  At that same time, there were further points that were also emitting this radiation. And the original photons from those original points still haven't gotten to us. So from those further out points-- right now, the observable universe is-- we can only see electromagnetic radiation that's been traveling for 13.7 billion years. In another billion years, the universe will be a billion years older. And then there will be radiation that has been traveling for 14.7 billion years. And so we will start to observe that. And we'll start to observe that radiation from the same time period in the universe. It'll just be from further out. Now, what I want to make clear is, is that since those points were even further out, where that radiation was emitted, the stuff that we'll see in a billion years, it will be even more red-shifted.  So at that point, the cosmic background radiation we see will have longer wavelengths than the radio spectrum. It will be redder And I should say redder because we're already more-- would ""redder"" have two Ds? I've never written ""redder."" Well, it would be more red than the microwave radiation. And, of course, that's a funny thing because microwave radiation is already more red than actual visible red light. It has a longer wavelength. Now, this will keep happening. And it'll keep happening. We'll keep getting radiation as we go further and further into the future. We'll keep getting radiation from further out points in space. And it'll get more and more red-shifted. The actual wave lengths of that electromagnetic light will be bigger, and bigger, and bigger. Until we really aren't able to even see it as electromagnetic light because it'll be red-shifted to infinity. It'll have an infinite wavelength. And to make that point clear, I want to show you that at some point, there will be kind of a threshold where we can't even get radiation from further out. And let me draw a diagram of that. So let's say that this is the universe. Let's say that this is the universe 13.7 billion years ago, right when that radiation, what we now see as cosmic microwave background radiation, right when it started to be admitted. And let's say that this is the point in the universe where we are now. So this is us. Let's say that this is the point in the universe where we now observe the background radiation-- or this is one of the points. We obviously could form a circle around us. It could be any of these points over here, where the photons, the electromagnetic radiation that were emitted from this point, 380,000 years after the beginning of the universe, is only just now reaching us. So this is the point in the universe from which we are observing the cosmic background radiation. And let me be very clear. That point in the universe has now matured into things that look-- into stars and galaxies and planets. And if they were to look at our point in space, they are also going to see cosmic background radiation from us. It's not like some type of permanently old place. It's just the light we're getting from them right now is old light, light that that point in space emitted way before it was able to mature into actual structures. So this is the point in space from which we are receiving cosmic background radiation right now. I don't want to write all that. It'll take me forever. Now, let's take another point in space that's whatever this distance is. Well, it's actually estimated to be about-- now, it's estimated to be about 46 billion light years. At that time, when things were just beginning to be emitted, this was only about 36 million light years. And this is a very rough estimate. I shouldn't even write it down. Because that's really based on how fast we assume the universe is expanding and all of that type of thing. But it was just a lot smaller than 46 billion light years. Now let's go that same distance again from this point in space. So let me make it clear. This is 380,000 years ago. Now let's fast forward. Let's fast forward-- sorry, not 380,000 years ago, 380,000 years after the Big Bang, which is approximately-- it's still 13.7 billion years ago. So that's then. Now let's look at now. And now I'll just draw it a little bit bigger. It's actually going to be much, much bigger now. Now, if we do it a little bit bigger-- so when I draw it like this, this is where we are now. This point in space from which we are only now receiving that cosmic background radiation is over here. And then this other point in space is going to be over here. And we saw in the video on the actual size of the observable universe, not just what it appears to be based on how long the light's been travelling, this is now on the order of 46 or 47 billion light years.  And so this distance is also going to be 46 billion light years.  Now, every point in space, back then, was emitting this radiation. We have this uniform radiation. It was just hydrogen atoms everywhere, these hot hydrogen atoms. Maybe I should just do it in the color of the radiation. So this guy's receiving-- I'm just showing it's coming from this guy. We're only now, 13.7 billion years in the future, receiving photons from this guy, only now are we receiving it. And frankly, this green guy, only now is going to be receiving photons. When he looks at the point in space, or the things that he thinks are points in space out there, he will see that uniform radiation. And likewise, this guy over here will only now be receiving photons from the point in space for where we are now. He'll see the universe where we are now as it was 380,000 years after the Big Bang. And same thing from that point in space, the photons will only just now reach. Now, let's think about it. It took this guy's photons-- let me make it clear. It took him 13.7 billion years to reach this point over here, which is now 46 billion light years away from us. And the universe continues to expand. Depending on if the universe expands fast enough, there's no way that that photon that got to this guy, will eventually get to this. The universe is expanding faster than the light can never even catch up to us. And this light will never, ever, ever get to us. And so there is some threshold, some distance, from which we will never get light during this time period or actually from which we will never, ever get any electromagnetic radiation. So the simple answer is the cosmic background radiation from this-- or the cosmic background radiation from this point, yes, it will start to mature. It won't be as uniform if we go fast forward 400 million years or a billion years. But we will get uniform radiation from further out. But it will be even more red-shifted. And the further forward we get into the future, the background radiation we get will be from further and further out and it will be more and more and more red-shifted. 1Until some point, where it's going 1to be so red-shifted that we won't even observe it 1as electromagnetic radiation. 1And there's some threshold where we won't even observe anything 1anymore because beyond that, the light wasn't 1able to actually get to us.",science_cosmology-and-astronomy_universe-scale-topic
" -  What we're gonna do in this video is see how we can approximate limits graphically and using tables. In the future, we're also going to be able to learn techniques where we're going to be able to directly figure out exactly what this limit is. But for now, let's think about how to approximate it, and I'll build our intuition for even what a limit actually is. So we want to know the limit as x approaches two of x to the third minus 2x squared over 3x minus six. Now, the first thing you might wanna check out is, well, what is this expression equal to when x is exactly equal to two? And we could do that by substituting x with two, so it'll be two to the third power minus two times two squared over three times two minus six. Well, this numerator over here, this is eight minus two times four minus eight, so that's going to be equal to zero, and then the denominator over here is six minus six. Well, that's a zero, and we end up in the indeterminate form right over here. So this expression is not defined for x equals two, but we can think about what does the expression approach as x approaches two. And first, let's think about it visually. So, if we were to graph it, and I graph this on the site Desmos, which has a nice graphing calculator, you see the curve, y equals this expression right over here. So this is the curve of y is equal... Let me do that in a darker color. This is equal to y is equal to x to the third minus 2x squared over 3x minus six. And you can see, at least everywhere where I've shown it here, and it's actually true, it's defined everywhere except for when x is equal to two, and that's why we have this little gap over here, showing that it is not defined. And so what I wanna do is I wanna approximate, well, as x gets closer and closer to two, either from lower values of two or from larger values of two, what is the value of this expression or the value of this function approaching? And at this level of zoom, it looks like it's approaching this value right over here, so as x gets closer and closer to two, it looks like our function is getting closer and closer to that value there, regardless of which direction we are approaching from, and so just approximating it visually right over here, let's see. This is zero, this is two. This is one, right over here. This would be 1.5. At this level of zoom, it looks like it's about 1.3 or 1.4, so 1.3 or 1.4. Let's zoom in a little bit more, and if you have access to a graphing calculator or you go to a website like Desmos or Wolfram Alpha, you can zoom in further and further on this graph, so I encourage you to try that out yourself or do it with other graphs. So let's zoom in even more. So once again, we're not defined at x equals two, but here we get a slightly better read. Let's see, this is one, this is two. The value that we are approaching as x gets closer and closer to two, we're getting, our value is getting closer and closer to that right over there, and if we look at what y value that is, let's see, if this is... This is split into one, two, three, four, five. So this is 1.2 right over here. This is 1.4 right over here. So it looks like it's between... So this would be 1.3 right over there. So it's a little bit more than 1.3. So a little more than 1.3. So, approximately, 1.3... Now, I do that in a lighter color. So it's approximately 1.3 something, it looks like. Let's zoom in even more to see if we can get an even better approximation. So now, once again, we're approaching that same value. We're not defined at x equals two, but as we're approaching x equals two, let's see. Let me get a darker color. So, it would be right around there, and this is, let's see, this is one, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5. So once again, it looks like it's about one point... If I were to just base it off of this, it looks like it's about 1.333 or 1.34, so I'd say approximately 1.33. So, approximately 1.33. If I were, it looks like it might be approaching 1 1/3, but we don't know for sure. Remember, when you're trying to figure out a limit from a graph the best you can really do here is just approximate, try to eyeball, well, the closer x gets to two, it looks like this function is approaching this value right over here. Now, another technique which tends to be a little bit more precise is to try to approximate this limit numerically. So let's do that. So let me get rid of these graphs here. We already got a sense of what the graphs can do for us. They got us to about 1.33, but now, let's try to do it numerically. So, I'm going to set up a table here, and I encourage you to do the same. So, on this column, I'll have my x, and on this column, I'm going to say, well, what is the expression x minus 2x squared over 3x minute six equals? And we know that when x is exactly equal to two, that this thing right over here isn't defined, but let's see what happens as we approach two. So let's see what happens when we're at 1.9, or 1.99... I'll do 1.99... I'll do 1.999. And we could also see from the other direction. We could say, well, what happens when we approach at 2.001, and see if we are getting... If this, if both of these values seem to be approaching something, and so this is approaching it from lower values of x and then we could say this was approaching it from higher values of x. We could say 2.1, right over here. So let me get a calculator out and evaluate these, and I encourage you to do the same, get a calculator out, and see if you can evaluate these things. All right, so let's see. If we can evaluate it when x equals 1.9, it's going to be 1.9 to the third power minus two times... Two times 1.9 squared. 1.9 squared is equal to, so we get that value, and then we're going to divide by, divide by, we get, we're gonna divide by three times 1.9 minus six, and that's going to be equal to, looks like it's about 1.203, so I'll just write approximately 1.203. Now, let's try it with a much closer value of x. So that was just 1.9. Now let's go to 1.999. So once again, we're gonna have 1.999 to the third power, and then minus two times, open parentheses, 1.999 squared, close the parentheses, is equal to, so that's my numerator, and then my denominator, so divided by, divided by, and now, open parentheses, three times 1.999 minus six, close my parentheses, is equal to 1.332. So this is interesting. So approximately 1.332. So numerically, I seem to be approaching that same value or close to that same value that I was approaching graphically, and we can also do it from values of x greater than two. Let me get my calculator back, and I'll do some of it, and I encourage you to finish this up on your own, and you could even try 1.999999 to see what it actually is approaching. So, for example, if I wanted to try 2.1, so that would be 2.1 to the third power, minus two times, open parentheses, 2.1 squared, and then close parentheses is equal to, that's my numerator, divided by, open parentheses, three times 2.1 minus 6, close parentheses. That's my denominator, and I get 1.47, so approximately 1.47. So now you can think I'm getting closer and closer to two from values larger than two. Let's see if we seem to be approaching the same value. So now let's get even closer to two, 2.01. And I'll do this one, and then I'll leave it up to you to see if you can get even more precise. So, two point... Actually, let's get super precise. Let's, well, let's do three zeroes here. 2.0001 to the third power minus two times, open parentheses, 2.0001. So we're getting really close. 1Squared, close parentheses, 1is equal to, so that's my numerator, 1divided by, open parentheses, 1three times 2.0001, 1minus six, this is my denominator. 1Is equal to, and notice, we're getting closer and closer 1and closer to 1 1/3, 1.333... 1Now, five. 1So, we'll say approximately 1.333, 1and this is now for, 1this is actually for 2.0001. 1So it does indeed look like we are approaching 1.333333, 1or close to, it looks like we are approaching 1 1/3. 1But once again, these are just approximations, 1both through the table or graphically. 1If you wanna find the exact value of the limit, 1there are other techniques. 1We're going to explore those techniques in future videos.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-limits-continuity
" I got a comment on the video where we first introduced parallax, especially relative to stars. Essentially asking, how do we know that this angle and this angle is always the same? Or how do we know that we're always looking at an isosceles triangle, where this side is equal to this side? It worked out for this example that I drew right here. But what if the star was over here? What if the star was over here. Then if you just look at it this way. If you take at this point, the triangle is no longer, it's clearly no longer, an isosceles triangle. It looks more like a scalene triangle, I guess, where all of the sides are different. And so a lot of that trigonometry won't apply. Because we won't be able to assume that this is a right triangle over here. And what I want to make clear is that that is true. You would not be able to pick these two points during the year. These two points in our orbit six months apart, in order to do the same math that we did in the last video. In order to calculate this and still have an isosceles triangle, what you want to do is pick two different points six months apart. So you want to do is if this is the sun, you want to pick two different points six months apart, where it does form an isosceles triangle. So if this is the distance from the sun to this other star right over here, you want to pick a point in Earth's orbit around the sun here. And then another point in the orbit six months later, which would put us right over here. And if you do that, then we are, now all of a sudden, we are looking at two right triangles, if we pick those periods correctly. And the best way to think about whether this is a perpendicular angle, is you're going to try to find the maximum parallax from center in each of these time periods. Here it's going to be maximally shifted in one direction. And then when you go to this six months later, it's going to be maximally shifted in the other direction. So to answer that question, the observation is right. At exactly the middle of summer in the middle of winter, all stars will not form an isosceles triangle with the sun and the earth. But you could pick other points in time around the year six months apart where any star will form an isosceles triangle. Hopefully you found that helpful.",science_cosmology-and-astronomy_stellar-life-topic
" We talk a lot of pressure, and I thought it would be kind of a neat exercise to go through what exactly is the point behind the pressure? Why does it matter so much what the end-diastolic pressure is? And that's what that ""ED"" means. And to do that, I think one of the best ways is to just say, well, what happens if we change it? What would be the result of changing the pressure at the end of diastole? The first change that you would see is-- you remember there's that equation around preload equaling-- we know the pressure at the end of diastole times radius at the end of diastole. And of course, then if pressure goes up, then preload would go up. And we know that wall thickness times 2 is in the denominator. So the first thing I would say is, well, if you say pressure goes up of if that's our assumption, then we have to assume that preload would go up as well. That's the next thing. Well, you might say, OK. Well, let's take it a step further. So what? That preload goes up. How does that change anything? Again, I think it's helpful to kind of think about what preload is, and then some things will become very, very obvious right away. If we look at a cut section of the left ventricle-- this is my left ventricle. And I've kind of sliced through it. Then, you know you've got pressure kind of hanging out in here. This is our end-diastolic pressure-- the same thing we started with. Right? Pressure at the end of diastole. And if you increase that pressure, then you know you're going to cause some changes around the walls. You're going to have wall stress. And we know that wall stress and the end of diastole we call ""preload."" So basically, these yellow arrows represent preload. And in fact, I might even point out to you that, if I actually zoomed in, there would be a little red cell, like a little square-ish. And that little red guy, that little red cell-- let's draw him over here-- he's actually going to literally start feeling the effects of stretch. So he's hanging out nice and happy. And all of a sudden, this little fella is going to get stretched. He's going to start looking like this. And I don't think he would be upset. I think he would look just as happy, but he might look like that. All stretched out. His eyes stretched away from his smile. So this is what our cell will begin to look like if we continued to stretch. And the reason is because you're literally yanking on the two sides. Right? So that's what becomes of this process. This causes the cells to almost look like little pancakes. I say pancakes just because I enjoy pancakes so much. But just remember that the cells flatten out and they stretch out. And that's a direct consequence of the increased preload. So this causes increase-- I'm just going to write ""stretching."" In fact, maybe I should even say ""stretching of heart cells"" just so we don't forget exactly what we're talking about. So stretching of heart cells. And you could literally imagine it. Right? You can imagine these little cells getting stretched out. And you can also imagine-- if you think for a moment-- of all of the contents of the cells getting stretched out. So stretching actually stretches out, not just the cell itself, but everything inside the cell. And a few interesting things begin to happen when all of the proteins inside of a cell get stretched out. There are two important things that happen with stretching. And now we're getting into kind of the meat and potatoes of increased pressure, what it causes. So the stretching itself is going to happen. I think that part you can kind of reason through that and kind of assume that that make sense. And one thing that it causes is what we call the ""Frank-Starling mechanism."" Obviously, named after two folks named ""Frank"" and ""Starling."" And the Frank-Starling mechanism-- we'll actually get into some details about this separately-- but the Frank-Starling mechanism, put simply, is going to be something like this. I'm going to draw another myosin and actin. So remember, myosin has got these fantastic little myosin heads always looking to work. Right? They're always looking to bind actin, and they're on both sides. I'm going to just draw it here. So here in purple is just myosin bit. And I'm going to actually cut and paste this and show you what it could look like on the side. I'm going to draw two versions, and we're going to start seeing how the Frank-Starling mechanism how it makes sense. So we've got this actin kind of sitting here, and it's on both sides. Right? So it's going to be on both sides. In this first drawing, I've drawn things very crowded. There's a lot of crowding happening there. And so you basically get these areas where-- for example, let's draw it here. These two myosin heads. And these two myosin heads are literally being blocked by this actin. So for example, these two myosin heads are being blocked by that actin, and these two are being blocked by that actin because they would both like to be on their other side. Right? They would like to be binding to that actin, and this set would like to bind to that actin. So you've got actin crowding out other actin, which sounds kind of funny because you think, well, so what? How come the myosin doesn't just simply bind the actin that's closest to it? Right? That seems like an obvious solution. But in fact, actin has a polarity. It can only really bind in one direction. So when things actually get crowded, that becomes a major problem because now myosin literally can't get to the actin with the correct polarity-- as you see in the first diagram. So what happens in the Frank-Starling mechanism is that, when you stretch out your heart cell, you're also stretching out-- as I said-- all the proteins within. And now you've got a lot of happy, happy myosin heads. These guys are happy. Right? These guys are happy, and these guys are happy as well. So basically, what you see is that, by stretching things out, you could actually get more myosins back on the job. And so that's kind of the key with the Frank-Starling mechanism-- you have more myosin heads at work. This is a key point. And there's some nuances to it. I've kind of simplified the Frank-Starling mechanism. There's some important nuances we'll get into-- as I said-- later, but this is one of the key elements of it. And the other stuff stretching-related mechanism is called an ""inotropic mechanism."" And usually, when you think of inotropic you're probably thinking that it has something to do with calcium. And you're right. Inotropic does have to do with calcium. And what it means is that basically-- let me, actually, give a little bit more space. If we were to zoom in now-- remember, we have our actin and myosin. And you know how valuable it is to have the two binding to each other. So you have something like this where your actin is there, and let's say you've got a mysosin here hoping to bind to it. This is our myosin. Then, what you see is that the actin is guarded by what? It's guarded by tropomyosin, Right? That's the protein that's kind of acting like a chaperone making sure that the myosin and the actin don't interact. This is our tropomyosin. Again, you can think of it as a chaperone just protecting that actin. And the thing that's going to help us move the tropomyosin out of the way is none other than our friend troponin. So this is our troponin, and troponin is going to scooch the triple myosin away. And troponin comes in three protein bits, and we call them ""Troponin C,"" ""Troponin I,"" and ""Troponin T."" And it's the Troponin C that I'm going to focus on for right now. So in the Troponin C, let's say it's looking like this. Right? This is our Troponin C. Remember, it's going to potentially bind to calcium. In fact, it will bind to calcium. This is my calcium. Right? So this is my Troponin C and my calcium. When things are stretched out-- so when things get stretchy, I'm going to say ""stretched""-- well, the proteins feel that. And the Troponin C is going to look stretched. It's going to look like that. So this is my Troponin C all stretched out. And Troponin C-- the stretched-out version-- literally behaves slightly different than the Troponin C when it's not stretched out. Troponin C when it's not stretched out is thinking to itself, well, eh, maybe I can bind calcium. Maybe not. I'm not particularly plussed either way. So it's thinking, eh, maybe I don't want to bind calcium. Maybe I do. But the Troponin C that's stretched out is saying, yes, please. Let's bind. So it's screaming to bind with calcium. So that's a big change, isn't it? Because if Troponin C wants to bind calcium-- and that's exactly what happens when things get stretched out, is that Troponin C kind of changes its shape, and now it really wants to bind calcium. 1If that happens, then all of a sudden, 1the Troponin C is going to be more 1effective at getting tropomysin out of the way. 1And myosin can now bind actin. 1So let's recap these two mechanisms. 1They have a lot to do with each other. 1Right? 1So when things stretch out, the Frank-Starling mechanism 1allows more myosin heads to get to work. 1And the inotropic mechanism basically 1is kind of a change in the way that Troponin C's shape is, 1and that change in shape makes it want to bind calcium 1very eagerly. 1So let's put it together. 1You've got more myosin heads at work. 1That's what Frank-Starling taught us. 1And as far as the inotropic mechanism, 1you may not have more calcium, but what calcium you do 1have is going to have a bigger effect because the Troponin 1C really wants to bind to it. 1Calcium has a bigger effect. 1So if you think about them, you've got more myosin now. 1And the calcium is obviously going 1to help the myosin bind to actin more easily. 1So putting it all together, you're 1going to basically get more myosin burning up 1ATP turning it into mechanical force or mechanical energy. 1So the end result of all this is that you 1have a larger mechanical force. 1I'll say left ventricular force of contraction. 1So this is kind of the end of the day what 1you're going to get. 1And as you get that larger force of contraction, 1I could go even further and say, well, what is that force? 1Well, it's pushing against blood, 1and that's pushing out on a certain area. 1And force over area is pressure. 1So a larger force of contraction really translates into-- what 1you're saying is-- a larger left ventricular pressure. 1And this-- just to be very, very clear-- 1is going to be during systole. 1So we started talking about diastole. 1Right? 1The question was-- what the heck is 1the point of knowing about preload and end-diastolic 1pressure? 1And the point is now very, very clear. 1Right? 1Because if you can have a higher preload set up 1the stretching of heart cells, that's 1going to cause two mechanisms to start 1changing the way that molecules within those heart cells 1are working. 1Right? 1The actin and myosin is actually going to be able to bind 1more easily to each other. 1And also, the calcium has a bigger effect-- kind 1of freeing up the actin. 1And at the end of the day, you get this larger left ventricle 1pressure during systole. 1So really, diastolic preload-- or what happens at the end 1of diastole, which we call ""preload""-- 1is going to have a huge effect on the left ventricle pressure 1during systole.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system
" -  Here we have a proton NMR spectrum for a molecule that has a molecular formula of C five H 10 O two. And let's start by calculating the hydrogen deficiency index. So if we have five carbons, we can have a maximum of two times five plus two hydrogens. And so that's equal to 12 so 12 hydrogens is the maximum number for five carbons. Here we have only 10 hydrogens, and so we're missing two hydrogens. We're missing one pair of hydrogens. So, therefore, we can say the HDI is equal to one. And when the HDI is equal to one, I immediately think a double bond is present in this molecule or a ring is present in this molecule. Next, you go to the integration values. So for this signal, an integration value of 33 point two. For this one, 48 point four. For this one 33 point 3 and then 48 point seven. And you divide all four integration values by the lowest one. So the lowest one would be 33 point two. So 33 point two divided by 33 point two is obviously equal to one. Forty-eight point four divided by 33 point two is approximately one point five. Thirty-three point three divided by 33 point two is obviously very close to one. And then finally, 48 point seven divided by 33 point two gives us approximately one point five. And these numbers tell us the relative ratio of protons that are giving us these four signals. But we need to think about 10 protons. So we have 10 hydrogens here, and so this is only relative. To get the absolute number of hydrogens, we need to multiply these numbers in this ratio by two. If we multiply one by two, we obviously get two so this signal represents two protons. Multiply one point five by two and we get three so this signal represents three protons. Multiply one by two, this signal is two protons. Multiply one point five by two, this signal is three protons. All right. Let's go through and look at each signal one by one. We start with the signal that has two protons on the left over here. So two protons that we're talking about is C H two group. So I go ahead and draw in a C H two group over here. How many neighboring protons for this C H two group? We can find that by thinking about the n plus one rule. If we have n neighboring protons, we'd expect to see n plus one peaks. So how many peaks do we have? One, two, three so three peaks. So to find the number of neighbors just subtract one. So three minus one is two so these two C H two protons have two neighboring protons. Next, let's think about the chemical shift. So this signal has a chemical shift of approximately four parts per million and that's the highest value for the chemical shift out of all four of these signals. And that's the region for a proton that's connected to a carbon that's bonded to an electronegative atom. And if we look at our molecular formula, we have two oxygens here. So I'm gonna take one of those oxygens and put that oxygen on that carbon because, once again, when you're thinking about the signal for a proton on a carbon that's bonded to an electronegative atom, you get a chemical shift somewhere. In this case, close to four parts a million because the oxygen is deshielding those protons. The oxygen is withdrawing electron density. All right, so that's one piece of the puzzle. And let's move on to our next signal so this will be the next piece of the puzzle. We have three protons so that's a methyl group. So let me go ahead and draw in a methyl group here so C H three. How many neighboring protons for those methyl protons? Well, we see one peak here. So one minus one is zero so zero neighboring protons. Let's think about the chemical shift. So the chemical shift is just past two parts per million and that's in the region for a proton that's next to a carbonyl. All right. So let's go ahead and draw in a carbonyl here. And we're assuming that the carbonyl carbon is bonded to another carbon over here. That makes sense in terms of numbers of neighbors. All right, so let's use blue for this. So the signal for these three protons, all right, zero neighbors. And so if we go to this carbon, if there's a carbon over here, there are no protons on this carbonyl carbon and so that explains this piece of the puzzle. Next, next signal. A C H two, all right. So we draw in a C H two here. How many neighbors? Little bit hard to see. One, two, three, four, five, six peaks. Six minus one is five so we would expect five neighbors using the oversimplified n plus one rule. And we'll come back to that C H two. And, finally, we have a signal with three protons so a C H three. How many neighbors for these methyl protons? We have one, two, three peaks. So three minus one is two, so two neighbors. All right, let's put all of the pieces of the puzzle together and let's draw the final dot structure. So let's start with this piece of the puzzle right here. So we have a carbonyl. So I'm gonna draw in my carbonyl here. And then we have a methyl group bonded to that carbonyl. So I'm gonna draw in our methyl group like that, and we used blue for these methyl protons. So the signal for these methyl protons appears right here. Next, let's think about a possible functional group. All right, well, we have a carbonyl. And then over here we have an oxygen. So if we put the oxygen next to the carbonyl, that gives us an ester. So let's go ahead and do that. Let's put the oxygen next to the carbonyl and then bonded to that oxygen we had a C H two. So I draw in my C H two there. And let's identify those protons. So the protons in magenta are giving us this signal over here. All right, next, let's think about, let's use red, and let's think about these protons, these methyl protons right here. Those methyl protons have two neighbors, and it makes sense that they would be these two neighbors right here. All right, so these chemical shifts are under two. So those are relatively far away from the oxygens. So let's draw in the methyl protons next. So we have our methyl protons right here. And let's make them red so let's highlight those. So these methyl protons right here are giving us this signal. And then, finally, we have a C H two left right here. So we draw in our C H two and let's make these green. All right, so these two protons right here in green are giving us this signal. All right, let's go through and see if everything makes sense. And we'll start with the green protons. So we predicted five neighbors. All right, so we look at the carbon that the green protons are on. We go to the next door carbon. One, two, three neighboring protons. We go to the other next door carbon. One, two so a total of five neighbors. And so that's what we predicted using the n plus one rule. In reality, the magenta and red protons are in different environments, and so this oversimplified n plus one rule isn't exactly correct, but it corresponds to what we see on the NMR spectrum. So we can just go with it here. It helped us figure out the structure of the molecule. All right, so this makes sense, five neighbors here. Let's move on to the red protons. We've predicted two neighbors for the red protons so we go to the carbon that's next door. All right, so this carbon has the red protons. We go to the next door carbon, and we see two neighbors. So this makes sense. All right, let's look at the magenta protons. So the magenta protons we predicted two neighbors. So the magenta protons are on this carbon. We go to the carbon next door, and I see one, two neighbors so this makes sense. And then, finally, the blue protons over here we predicted zero neighbors. So we go to the carbon that's next door to this carbon, and there are no protons on this carbon. All right, so zero neighbors and that's why we got our singlet over here. So this makes sense. The chemical shifts make sense. The splitting makes sense. Everything seems to make sense for this ester. One thing I've noticed when students get a problem with an ester, sometimes they reverse the ester. Let me show you what I mean. So I've seen a lot of students do this on exams. What they'll do is they identify the fact they have an ester, but in this case they would put the methyl group on the oxygen and then draw in the rest of the molecule over here. So we had three carbons so one, a two, a three. And they'll put this down for their answer on a test. So why is this wrong? Well, this is wrong because the signal for these methyl protons that's right next to this oxygen. This oxygen is deshielding, so we would get a singlet for these methyl protons, but the signal would be closer to four parts per million and not right here, not right here at two parts per million. And so that's a clue as to how to assemble the pieces for an ester. So think about what's next to this oxygen here. Think about the chemical shifts and you won't make that mistake. For this NMR spectrum our molecule has a molecular formula of C four H 10 O. And let's calculate the hydrogen deficiency index. So if we have four carbons, the maximum number of hydrogens we can have is two times four plus two, which is equal to 10 and that's how many hydrogens 1we have in our molecular formula. 1So this time we're not missing any hydrogens 1and so the HDI is equal to zero. 1So we wouldn't expect any double bonds or rings 1so no double bonds or rings for the dot structure. 1For integration, this signal is one proton, 1this signal is three protons, and this signal over here 1is six protons. 1Let's focus in on this signal. 1So we have one proton. 1So I'm gonna go ahead and draw that proton 1on a carbon like that. 1Let's think about how many neighbors that proton has. 1So look at the peaks. 1I see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven peaks. 1So seven minus one is six so that proton is going to have 1six neighboring protons. 1I'm gonna go ahead and give that proton a color. 1So this is the signal for the magenta proton. 1The chemical shift is somewhere around 1four parts per million and that's the chemical shift 1that we would expect if that proton 1was on a carbon bonded to an electronegative atom. 1And we have an oxygen here. 1So I'm gonna go ahead a put an oxygen right here 1bonded to that carbon because the oxygen is withdrawing 1electron density away from this proton. 1It's deshielding this proton, 1giving it a higher chemical shift. 1All right, let's move on to our next signal. 1So we have three protons. 1So this would be a methyl group. 1So we have three methyl protons. 1How many neighboring protons for those methyl protons? 1We have only one peak here. 1So one minus one is zero, so zero neighboring protons. 1And the chemical shift is about 1three point five parts per million 1so those methyl protons must be really close to that oxygen. 1We get a higher value for the chemical shift. 1And so we can put the methyl protons over here 1on the left side of the oxygen. 1All right, and so that makes sense 1in terms of the chemical shift. 1All right, it also makes sense in terms of 1the number of neighbors. 1So these three protons right here give us this signal, 1and we have zero neighbors. 1So there are no neighbors for these three protons. 1Let's move on to the last signal. 1All right, so we have six protons 1so that's like two methyl groups. 1So we have two methyl groups here. 1And the signal is split into a doublet. 1So we see these two peaks here. 1So two minus one is one so we expect one neighbor 1for these two methyl groups. 1And obviously, it would have to be this proton in magenta 1because we have these, only these two places left. 1So we put these methyl groups right here, 1and we can see we get one neighbor. 1So those two methyl groups are further away 1from the oxygen relatively because of the signal 1having a lower value for the chemical shift. 1So let's use red here so red for these six protons. 1It's giving us this signal, 1and we have one neighboring proton. 1It's this proton in magenta right here. 1Let's think about the magenta proton. 1We said that the magenta proton 1would have six neighbors and that's what we see. 1So three from this methyl and then three from this methyl. 1So six neighbors for the magenta proton. 1And then, finally, we said there'd be zero neighbors 1for the protons in blue and that's what we see 1for our dot structure. 1And so this molecule is an ether 1so this NMR spectrum represents this ether.",science_organic-chemistry_spectroscopy-jay
" - Here are three generations of a family. Let's say that one day the seven year old develops a little cough, which soon turns into something much worse. I have an audio clip of the cough, and I want you to pay special attention to the noise the boy makes when he catches his breath. (coughing sounds) So this boy is definitely having a coughing fit that's causing him to cough out the entire air content of his lungs. But did you hear the noise he makes when he is finally able to take his breath? It's this sort of whooping noise. And, well, this is the signature noise that gives the disease whooping cough its name. Whooping cough is also called pertussis, because it's caused by an infection from a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. If we were to look at pertussis under a microscope, we would see these rod-shaped bacteria like I'm drawing here. And the bacteria infects the respiratory tract, and releases toxins which cause damage and inflammation to the airways. And this damage causes mucus to build until a violent cough reflex is triggered. And when breathing in after one of these fits the air is travelling rapidly though swollen airways and this is what generates that whooping noise. Now pertussis is highly contagious because it's transferred person to person through mucus droplets containing live bacteria that's coughed or sneezed into the air. So let's say that mom is close by, within three feet of her son, she might breathe in mucus droplets and become infected. Or droplets can be passed along by shared surfaces, like a toy shared with this boy's sister. She may pick up the bacteria on her hands and then rub her eyes and nose, and introduce the bacteria into her body. And this is why coughing and sneezing into the elbow instead of the hand, and lots of hand washing is so important. It's also why healthcare workers treating the family will wear gowns, gloves, and masks to minimize cross-contamination between their patients. But there's a particular stage during the infection where the disease is most contagious. So let's get a timeline going to explore that, and we'll start with the initial exposure to the bacteria. Typically, there's about a week long incubation period where the bacteria is in the respiratory tract, and it's dividing and causing it's damage, but there are no clinical symptoms present yet. None of the clinical symptoms present for about 12 weeks. So I'm going to draw out the entire clinical timeline to 12 weeks, but actually, the 12 weeks is divided into three stages. The first stage is on the onset of the clinical symptoms to about two weeks. It has this fancy name called the catarrhal stage. And the word cattarhal literally means inflammation of the respiratory tract with increased secretions. So this stage is appropriately named because the main clinical symptom that you see here is a runny nose with sneezing a small cough, and a low grade fever. The symptoms make it hard to distinguish from a common cold, but unfortunately, it's this stage that pertussis is most contagious, because the bacteria hasn't been killed by the immune system yet, and so it's dividing to high numbers, so each cough, and each sneeze expels live bacteria into the air. So the onset of symptoms, an infected person should really stay away from others until at least 21 days. By then, the body has been able to generate antibodies against pertussis, which tag it as a foreign invader needing to be killed by the immune system. During the next two to eight weeks, known as the paroxysmal stage, most of the bacteria is dead, so the disease isn't as contagious, but the damage and the inflammation caused by the bacteria in the weeks leading up till now, can cause extreme coughing fits and whooping noises like we talked about earlier. And actually, that's exactly how this stage gets its name. A paroxysm is a fit or a re-occurrence of a symptom. Here, it's coughing, and these coughing fits are absolutely exhausting. And they are frequently followed by vomiting and other complications from the forcefulness of the cough. But finally, the convalescent stage is reached at weeks eight to 12. Convalescence literally means recovery from an illness, and that's exactly what the body is doing during this time. The infection has been cleared from the body, and the body now needs to heal from the respiratory tract infection and damage. Over time, the frequency and the intensity of the coughing will go away, but it takes a really long time, and it's the reason that some cultures call pertussis the 100 day cough. Even though I've clearly laid out these three clinical stages, in reality the stages can be difficult to decipher depending on a few modifying factors. And a modifying factor would be anything that changes the length or the severity of the disease. So, for example, age. Let's say a two month old is infected. Infants may not have the energy after a coughing fit to breathe in strongly and get air rapidly in past swollen, inflamed airways, so an infant may not whoop after a coughing fit. Adults may have coughing fits, but they may not whoop after, because their airways are larger, and can handle being swollen a bit without drastically reducing airflow. Another modifying factor is immunization status. And let's say that grandma had a pertussis vaccine in the last 10 years. Her body's primed for a pertussis infection, so if she becomes exposed, her body can fight it faster, and in a shorter amount of time. And the damage and the inflammation may not progress to the point where she has a whooping cough, or any cough at all. For the same reason of having the body primed, previous exposure to pertussis can also be a modifying factor. So, for example, if grandpa recently had a pertussis infection, his body's primed to fight a re-exposure for a second time, and just like grandma, his coughing fits, whooping and vomiting and other complications can be milder, if they occur at all.",science_health-and-medicine_infectious-diseases
" -(Voice over) So we left off in part one getting pretty close to finding our N of T that satisfies the logistic differential equation where it's initial condition is between zero and K, and now we just have to really just do some algebra to finish things up. So we left with this. For our N of T this must be true. Now, we could use a little bit of logarithm properties to rewrite this left hand side as the logarithm of. The logarithm of something minus the logarithm of something else, that's going to be the first something, The logarithm of the first something divided by the second something. One minus N over K, and this is of course going to be equal to all this business that we have, is going to be equal to, actually let me just write it. It's going to be equal to, equal to, R times T plus C, plus C, and now what we could do, this is the same thing as saying that E to the R T plus C is going to be equal to this thing right over here. This, the natural log of this, is equal to the exponent that I have to raise E to to get to this right over here, so I could just write that. We could just write, or another way of thinking about it, we could take E, if this is equal to that, we could take E to this power on this left hand side, and E to this power on this right hand side, and they should be equal. So E to this power is just going to be what's inside the parenthesis. It's just going to be N. It's just going to be N over one minus, one minus, N over K. I'll do that in a green color, so you can keep track of where things came from. Is equal to E to this business. Is equal to E to the R T. R, I'll do the T in white. R T plus C, plus C. Now this I could rewrite if I want to. If I have E to something plus something else, I could rewrite this as to the R T times E times E to the C, and just to simplify things, this is just going to be another constant here, and I could, if this is C, I could call it C one, but I'm just going to call that a constant. So I could just say that that's going to be equal to some constant times E to the R T, and now we just need to solve for N. And once again, at any point while we're working on this you get inspired, feel free to solve for N. So let's see. One way to solve for N. Let's see. If we could take the reciprocal of both sides of this, we're going to get. Let me draw a line here just so you know we're. Let me draw a line. So, if we take the reciprocal of both sides of this, we're going to get one over N, one minus N over K over light green N is equal to, is equal to, and so let's, we could say it's equal to, it's equal to one over C time E to the negative R T. But one over C, that's just going to be another constant. So I could write one over C here, and I take the reciprocal. And once again, this is just going to be another constant, so I'm going to be a little bit of hand waving, and say well O.K we're going to get another constant here. I could have called this C one, this C two. I could call this C three if I want to make it clear that these are not going to be the same number. This is E to the this power. This is the reciprocal of that. Actually, maybe I'll do that just to make it a little bit clearer. That would have been C one right over there, and so this is going to be, sorry, the reciprocal of this C three and E to the negative, the reciprocal of E to the R T is E to the negative R T. E to the negative, E to the negative R, E to the negative R T. And let's see, if we divide the numerator and the denominator by N, or if we divide E. I want to think, if we divide this term by in we're going to get. So this term by N is going to be one over N, and then this term by N is just going to be minus one over K. So this is just going to be minus one over K is equal to this. This is equal to this business. So copy and paste. It's going to be equal to that. This is good algebra practice here. Now let's see. We could take this one over K, add it to both sides, so let's do that. So let me just cut, so let me cut and paste it. I'm going to add it to both sides, so that should be a plus one over K. So, plus one over K. And now to solve for N, I just take the reciprocal of both sides. So I'm going to get, I'm going to get N. And I'll write it in kind of the function notation. N of T, actually let me make my T in white since I've been taking the trouble all this time of rewriting this in white, is equal to one over. Is going to be equal to one over all of this business. Is going to be equal to one over all of this business. So copy and paste. Is going to be equal to that. And that by itself. That's by itself is already interesting. That by itself is already interesting. So I could write it like this. And if I want, if I don't like, let's see, well yeah I could just, if I don't like having this K kind of a fraction in a fraction, I could rewrite it as. Actually, maybe I'll do it over here. N of, N of T is equal to. I'll just multiply the numerator and the denominator by. I'll just multiply it, actually let me just leave it like that for now. And what I'm going do, what I'm now going to do, is say, ""Well look. ""We're assuming that N of zero is N sub knot."" So we're assuming that N of zero, N of zero, is equal to N sub knot. So let's write this thing. Let's solve for the constant. Let's figure out what this could be if we know what our initial condition is. So N of zero, N of zero, is going to be equal to, is going to be equal to one, one over. When T is zero, this is just going to be equal to one, so it's just going to be our constant C three plus one over K plus one over the maximum population that our population, that our environment, can handle, and that's going to be equal to N knot, and now we can solve for our constant. So we get, let's see I'm probably going to need a lot of real estate for this, so I can take the reciprocal of both sides again, so this is something that we're doing a lot of. C three plus one over K is equal to one over N knot. Is equal to one over N knot. Just took the reciprocal of both sides, and so we get our constant C three is equal to one over N knot minus one over K. Minus one over K. So we can rewrite our solution, which we'll call the logistic function, we get, we get, this is fun now, N of T. N of T is equal to one over, our constant is this, so it's going to be, let me copy and paste this. So copy and paste. It's going to be that, that's our constant. So it's going to be that times E to the negative R T, to the negative R times T, plus one over K, plus one over K. And if we don't like having all of these denominators in, all of these fractions in the denominator, why don't we multiply everything times the numerator and the denominator by N knot K. So I'm going to multiply the numerator times N knot K, and I'm going to multiply the denominator by N knot K. N knot K. And so what do we get? This is all going to be equal to. In the numerator I have N knot times K, N knot times K. And in the denominator I am going to have, let's see if I multiply this term right over here times N knot K I'm going to have K. If I multiply this term times N knot K, I'm going to have N knot, so it's going to be minus N knot, minus N not, times E to the negative R T, Times E to the negative R T, negative R T, and then if I multiply this times N not K, I'm going to get N knot. So plus N knot. And there you have it. We have found a solution for the logistic differential equation. We will call this logistic function, and in future videos we will explore it more, and we will see what it actually does. If you were to plot this, and I encourage you to do so, either on the internet, you could try Wolfram Alpha, or if you're on your graphing calculator, you will see that it has the exact properties that we want it to have. It starts at N knot. It starts to increase at an increasing rate, but then it starts to slow down as we reach our maximum population. And so that is actually a very neat function. If you model a population with this, you can kind of start to make predictions about what might the population be at time whatever. And so, hopefully, you found that satisfying.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-diff-equations
" - Here we have a graph of exponential decay. Where N refers to the number of radioactive nuclei, alright as a function of time. And so this, right, this equation describes our graph. So this would be the number of radioactive nucleis at any time, T, is equal to N naught, the initial number of nuclei, E to the negative lambda T. Lambda is equal to the decay constant. So this is just some constant number here. And you could also call this K, if you wanted to, you could call it K if you're thinking about the rate constant. But that's just some constant and now we're gonna multiply it by the time here. So let's say we wanted to, let's say we wanted to find what this point right here represents on our graph. Well that's when time is equal to zero. So let's plug in, let's plug in time is equal to zero into our equation. So this would be the number of radioactive nuclei when time is equal to zero, is equal to N naught, times E to the negative lambda times T, which is zero. So that's that is equal to, this would be N naught times E to the zero. Each of the zero is one. So the number of radioactive nuclei at time is equal to zero, is equal to N naught. So this represents N naught, the initial number of radioactive nuclei on our graph. And you could do this for any time T, right? You could just pick a time, let's say that's our time that we wanted, right, and go up to here and find what this value is on the graph. And so at any time T, right, this would represent the number of radioactive nuclei. Let's do it for half-life. So remember, when half-life-- when time is equal to a half-life, right, the number of radioactive nuclei, this would be, let's see one half-life, so this would be the initial divided by two. So half of it remains. So let's look at that on our graph, right, so if we take N naught, we divide that by two, that's approximately here, so let's say this is N naught over two. And we go over to, we go over to here, and we drop down to our time, so this should represent our half-life. That time should represent our half-life. So that's what it looks like graphically. Let's take these numbers, let's take the half-life and what the number of radioactive nuclei would be and let's plug it in to this equation. Alright, so let's go ahead and do that. Let's get some more room. So I'm just gonna rewrite that equation here. So we had the number of radioactive nuclei as a function of time is equal to the initial number of radioactive nuclei times E to the negative lambda T. So let's plug in those, let's plug in those. So when we're gonna talk about the half-life we're gonna plug that in here for the time. And then the number of radioactive nuclei would be N naught divided by two. So let's plug those in. So we would have N naught divided by two, is equal to N naught E to the negative lambda times the half-life. Alright, well that cancels out the N naughts. Alright so that gives us on the left side one half is equal to E to the negative lambda times the half-life. So next, let's get rid of the E. And we can do that by taking the natural log of both sides. Alright, so if I take the natural log of one half on the left side and I take the natural log of E to the negative lambda T one half. Alright, on the left side natural log of one half is equal to negative .693 so this is just plug it in your calculator you'll get negative .693 and the right, that takes care of this all that's equal to just this over here. Right, so now you would have-- this would negative lambda T one half. And so we don't have to worry about the negative signs, right, so this is just .693 is equal to lambda times T one half. So we could solve for the half-life, right, so if we solve for T one half. So T one half would be equal to .693 divided by lambda, divided by the decay constant. So this is one of those equations, right, that you see for half-life. So what if you wanted to go ahead and solve for lambda, the decay constant. Right, so that's obviously really simple. We just do the decay constant is equal to .693 divided by the half-life. And so obviously I'm just rearranging this equation here. So you could solve for half-life or you could solve for the decay constant. You could go back and forth between the half-life and the decay constant. So if you know one, you can figure out the other one. Alright so that's thinking about the exponential decay graph. Let's talk about semi-log plots next, which is another way at looking at the data. And so let's get some room here. I'm going to rewrite our equation, right, so the number of radioactive nuclei is equal to the initial number times E to the negative lambda T. Alright so let's convert this into a linear, into a straight line. So what we have to do, we have divide by N naught. We have N divided by N naught. So we divide both sides by N naught and we get E to the negative lambda T here. Right now, to get rid of this E once again we just take the natural log. So we take the natural log of both sides, so natural log of N over N naught is equal to the natural log of E to the negative lambda T. Alright so on the left side we have a log property so natural log of N over N naught is equal to natural log of N minus natural log of N naught. And then on the right, right, this goes away and we're left with this. So negative lambda T, so we have negative lambda T on the right side here. And if we just rearrange this, right, so let's just do natural log of N is equal to negative lambda T, so we're gonna add LN of N naught to this side. And now we have, now we have a very interesting, very interesting form. If you look at it closely you'll see this is the same thing as Y is equal to MX + B, which is the equation for a straight line. So Y, Y would be equal to natural log of N. M would be equal to negative lambda, alright so we're talking about T, right, as being X here. And then natural log of N naught is equal to B. So Y is equal to MX + B if you remember the equation, it's the graph of a straight line, right, where M is the slope. Alright so, we could say the slope of this is equal to negative lambda. And remember that this is your vertical intercept, right? So B is your vertical intercept so if we graph this our vertical intercept should be natural log of N naught. So let's go ahead and sketch this out really quickly. I won't be too concerned with details here but if we're graphing it. So if you think about this is being your Y axis, I'll just put this in parentheses cuz that's not really what we're doing. And this being your X axis, right, let's look at those again. So for my Y, I would be graphing natural log of N. So let me go ahead and use a different color so we can see it here. So natural of N on the Y axis. On the X axis here, that would be time. So we have time over here. Alright and we know that the vertical intercept is going to be natural log of N naught. So this vertical intercept is going to be here natural log of N naught. And we could prove that really quickly, right, we could say when time is equal to zero, right, so when time is equal to zero, let's plug that in, we could have natural log of N, which is equal to negative lambda times zero plus natural log of N naught. Right, so this would go away and you can see that we would have natural log of N naught would be equal to this point here. So that's our vertical intercept. And we know this is the graph of a straight line. And we're gonna have a negative slope here, so if I go ahead and draw this in it would look something like, oh just pretend like that's a straight line. I didn't do a very good job but you can use your imagination there. And the slope of this, right, so the slope, remember what slope is. That's change in Y over change in X. That would be the change in this axis over the change in this axis. That's equal to, right, that is equal to negative lambda, what we talked about over here. And so if you do a semi-log plot, right, so it's semi-log because we have this natural log over here versus here. It tells us some information, right, so it's another way to look at the data. You could find the slope of this straight line, right, take the negative of it and get your decay constant. 1And then from your decay constant 1you could get your half-life. 1And so once again sometimes you'll see 1semi-log plots done as just 1a different way at looking at the data.",science_in-in-class-12th-physics-india_nuclei
" We're now ready to get into the meat of evaluating this surface integral. And we really need to re-express it in terms of a double integral in the domain of the parameters. And the first thing I'm going to do is rewrite this part right over here using our parameters. And we already know that n, our normal vector times our surface differential, can also be written as kind of a vector version of our surface differential that points in the same direction as our normal vector. And this is going to be the same thing. And we need to make sure that we get the order on the cross product right as the partial derivative-- and I'm going to confirm this in a second. The partial derivative of the parametrization with respect to one of the parameters crossed with the partial derivative of the parametrization with respect to the other parameter. And then that whole thing-- I'm not going to take the absolute value because I need a vector right over here-- times differentials of the parameters-- d theta dr. And we can swap these two things around depending on what will make our eventual double integral easier. But we can't swap these two things around because this would actually change the direction of the vector. So we need to make sure that this is popping us out in the right direction. So let's think about the direction that the partial with respect to r will take us. So as r increases, we're going to be moving radially outward from the center of our surface. Let me do this in a different color. As r increases, we'll be moving radially outwards. So this quantity will be a vector that looks something like that. And then as theta increases, we'll be going roughly in that direction. And so if we take the cross product of those two things-- and we could use the right-hand rule. Take your right hand, point your index finger in the direction of that yellow vector. Let me make it clear-- this is the orange vector right over here. Take your index finger in the direction of that yellow vector. So that's my index finger, my shakily drawn yellow index finger. Put your middle finger in the direction of the orange vector. So my middle, you bend it and put it in the direction of the orange vector. And we don't care what the other two fingers do. And then, your thumb will be in the direction of the cross product. So your thumb will point outward like that. That's my best attempt at drawing it. Which is exactly the direction we needed to point it. We need it to point upward here in order to be oriented properly with the direction that we are actually traversing the path. So this is actually the right order. If when we did this we got the thumb pointing into it or below the plane, then we would actually have to swap these orders. So with that out of the way, let's actually evaluate this cross product. So the cross product of the partial of our parametrization with respect to r crossed with the partial of our parametrization with respect to theta. I like to set up the matrix to take the cross product. So we'll put i, j, and k components, < like that. And then, first, I will write the partial with respect to r. So the i-component, if you take the derivative of this with respect to r, is just going to be cosine theta. The derivative of this with respect to r is just sine theta. And the derivative of this with respect to are r is just going to be a negative sine theta. And then we're going to cross it with this, so the derivative of this with respect to theta is going to be negative r sine of theta. The derivative of our j-component with respect to theta will be r cosine theta. And the derivative or our k-component-- or our z-component with respect to theta-- is going to be-- let's see-- negative r cosine theta. Is that right? Yeah. Derivative of sine theta's cosine theta. Yeah. So it's negative r cosine theta. And now we just evaluate this determit over here. Our i-component is going to be-- so ignore that row and this column. And we get sine times negative r cosine theta. I'll just do this in a new color. So we're going to get negative r-- that wasn't a new color. I'll do it in purple. We will get negative r cosine theta sine theta minus-- well, this is going to be a negative number. So when you subtract a negative number, it's going to be plus. So it's going to be plus r cosine theta sine theta. It's always nice when things cancel out like this. This plus this is just 0. Negative of it plus the positive of it. So that all canceled out to 0. We don't have an i-component. Now, let's go to the j-component. And remember, we need to do our little checkerboard pattern. So it's going to be minus j. And it's going to be-- ignore this column, that row-- cosine theta times negative r. Cosine theta is negative r cosine squared theta. I just multiplied those two. And then, from that I'm going to subtract this times that. And so this times that, the negatives cancel out. We get r sine squared theta. So this is minus-- let me make sure. Yeah, I'm going to subtract the product of these two. The product is positive. It's going to be r sine squared theta. This is always a hard part. You can make a lot of careless mistakes here. And this looks like we might be able to simplify this in a second, but I'll wait. Actually, I'll just distribute this negative sign just for fun. So if we distribute the negative sign, these all become positive. Helps simplify things a little bit. And now let's worry about the k-component. The k-component I will be doing in purple-- well, I'll do it in blue. The k-component. Ignore this row, ignore this column. So plus k times cosine theta times r cosine theta is r cosine squared of theta. And then from that, I'm going to subtract negative r sine theta times sine theta. So that's going to be negative r sine squared theta, but I'm subtracting it. So it's going to be plus r sine squared theta. And this looks like we're going to simplify it as well. And so this piece right over here, we can factor out-- let me just rewrite it. This can be rewritten as r times cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta. Basic trig identity. That just evaluates to 1. So this is just r times j. And this over here simplifies for the exact same reason. This is r times cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta. This also is just 1. So this just simplifies to r times k. This whole cross product-- all of this business right over here-- simplified to, quite luckily, is equal to r times our j unit vector plus r times our k unit vector. And so now we can write our surface integral. Our original surface integral we can write as the double integral. Or we might want to change the order in which we integrate, but we'll give ourselves that option a little bit later. Double integral. Now, it's going to be over our parameter domain or the r theta domain. So it's the double integral of-- we still have the curl of f. And we're going to have to evaluate the curl of f. So I'll just write ""curl of our vector field f"" dotted with this business, rj plus rk. And then we have our two parameters. And we might want to switch the order. So maybe we could write d theta dr. And then if we do it in this order, theta goes from 0 to 2 pi, and r is going from 0 to 1. But if we swap these two, then obviously, we're going to have to swap these two as well. I'll leave you there. In the next video, we will evaluate the curl of f. And maybe in that video, if we have time, we will get to the finish line.",math_multivariable-calculus_greens-theorem-and-stokes-theorem
" Now that we have a parameterization for the boundary of our surface right up here, let's think a little bit about what the line integral-- and this was the left side of our original Stokes' theorem statement-- what the line integral over the path C of F, our original vector field F, dot dr is going to be. And now, once again, this R we're talking about the path of this boundary right over here, C. Not C1 that we did to kind of get some of our foundational material going. So F dot dr-- well, we remember what F is. F was all the way up here. Its i, j, and k components were just P, Q, and R. So that's kind of easy to remember. But let's think about what dr is equal to. And we're going to have to break out a little bit of our three-dimensional or our multivariable chain rule right over here. So dr is the same thing as dr dt times dt. So we really just have to figure out what the derivative of R with respect to t. And this one we're going to have to break out a little bit of the chain rule. So let me write this down. So dr dt is going to be equal to the derivative of x with respect to t times i plus the derivative of y with respect to t-- I'm just taking the derivative with respect to t-- j. Because z is a function of x, which is a function of t, and z is also a function of y, which is a function of t, we're going to have to break out our multivariable chain rule. So if we want to take the derivative of z with respect to t-- I'll do it separately here, and then I'll write it down down here. The derivative of z with respect to t-- the way I conceptualize is, what's all the different ways that z can change from a change in t? Well, it could change because x is changing due to a change in t. So z could change due to x, the partial of z with respect to x, when x changes with respect to t. But then that's not the only way that z can change. We have to add to that how z can change with respect to y, partial of z with respect to y times how fast or how y is changing with respect to t. And this is just our multivariable chain rule. And so this is dz dt. So I'll just write it right over here. And I'll use slightly different notation that's consistent with what we were doing before, and it'll help make things a little bit clearer. So it's going to be the partial of z with respect to x, dx dt, plus-- actually, let me write it this way-- plus the partial of z with respect to y dy dt. And then we're going to multiply everything times our k. So with this out of the way, if we wanted what dr is, dr is just going to be this whole thing times dt. So let's do that. So now we can rewrite our line integral right over here. And we're going to now go into the t domain. And so t is going to go between a and b. And F dot dr-- remember, F's components were just the functions P, Q, and R. And each of those were functions of x, y, and z. And z is a function of x and y, so we'll have to think about all of that in a little bit. Use a little more of our multivariable chain rule. But when we take the dot products, we're just going to take the corresponding components and multiply them. So it is going to be-- actually, let me just copy and paste it. Let me rewrite it down here. Our vector field F-- and I'm going to write it a little bit shorter. Our vector field F is P times i plus Q times j plus R times k. So when we take our dot product of F dot dr, we're essentially taking the dot product of this and this. And we have to throw a dt at the end. So we're going to get P times dx dt plus Q times dy dt plus R times all of this business over here, which is the partial of z with respect to x dx dt plus the partial of z with respect to y dy dt. And then we have to multiply all of this times dt. We can't forget that part right over there. So we're going to multiply all of this right here times dt. Now, I'm going to leave you there in this video just because I'm afraid of making careless mistakes. What we're going to do now is we're going to rearrange this whole thing, recognize that this is the same thing as this right over here. Then that gives it a form that we can apply Green's theorem using this boundary right over here. And then when we do a little bit more algebraic manipulation, we're going to see that this thing simplifies to this thing right over here and proves Stokes' theorem for our special case.",math_multivariable-calculus_greens-theorem-and-stokes-theorem
" -  In the last couple videos I talked about the local linearization of a function. And in terms of graphs, there's a nice interpretation here where if you imagine a graph of a function and you want to approximate it near a specific point, you picture that point somewhere on the graph, and it doesn't have to be there, you know I can choose to be anywhere else along the graph, but if you have some sort of point and you want to approximate the function near there you can have another function whose graph is just a flat plane, and specifically a plane which is tangent to your original graph at that point. And that's kind of visually how you think about the local linearization. And what I'm going to start doing here in this next video and in the ones following, is talking about quadratic approximations. So quadratic approximations, and these, these basically take these to the next level. And first I'll show what they look like graphically and then I'll show you what it actually means in formulas. But graphically instead of having a plane that's flat, you have a few more parameters to deal with, and you can give yourself some kind of surface that hugs the graph a little bit more closely. It's still going to be simpler in terms of formulas, it can still be notably simpler than the original function, but this actually hugs it closely. And as we move around the point that it's approximating here, the way that it hugs it can look pretty different. And if you want to think graphically what a quadratic approximation is, you can basically say if you slice this surface, this kind of ghostly white surface in any direction it'll look like a parabola of some kind. And notice that given that we're dealing in multiple dimensions that can make things look pretty complicated, like this right here, you know if you slice it kind of in this direction, whoa, if you look at it from this angle it kind of looks like a concave up parabola, but if you were looking at it from another direction it kind of looks concave down, and all-in-all you get a surface that actually has quite a bit of information carried within it. And you can see that by hugging the graph very closely this approximation is going to be, well, it's going to be even closer, because near the point where you're approximating you can go out, you know, you can take a couple steps away and the approximation is still going to be very close to what the graph is, and it's only when you step really far away from the original point that the approximation starts to deviate away from the graph itself. So this is going to be something that although it takes more information to describe than a local linearization it gives us a much closer approximation. So a linear function which, you know, one that just draws a plane like this, in terms of actual function what this means, so kind of a linear, this is going to be some kind of function of x and y, and what it looks like is some kind of constant, which I'll say a plus another constant times the variable x, plus another constant times the variable y, this is sort of the basic form of linear functions. And technically this isn't linear if one is going to be really pedantic and they would say that that's actually affine, because I'm strictly speaking linear functions shouldn't have this constant term, it should be purely x's and y's, but in the context of approximations people would usually call this a linear term. So quadratic term, what this is going to look like, quadratic, we are allowed to have all the same terms as that linear one, so you can have constant, you can have these two linear terms bx and cy, and then you're allowed to have anything that has two variables multiplied into it. So maybe I'll have d times x squared, and then you can also have something times xy, this is considered a quadratic term. Which is a little bit weird at first, because usually we think of quadratics as associated with that exponent two, but really it's just saying any time you have two variables multiplied in, and then we can add some other constants, say f times y squared. Where, you know, now we're multiplying two y's into it. So all of these guys, these are what you would call your quadratic terms. Things that either x squared, y squared, or x times y, anything that has two variables in it. So you can see this gives us a lot more control because previously, as we tweaked the constants a, b, and c, you're able to give yourself, you know, that gives you control over all sorts of planes in space, and if you choose the most optimal one you'll get one that's tangent to your curve at this specific point, and kind of, it'll depend on where that point is, you'll get different planes, but they're all tangent. So what we're going to do in the next couple of videos, is talk about how you tweak all of these six different constants so that you can get functions that really closely hug the curve, right? And as you, and they're all going to depend on the original point because as you move that point around, what it takes to hug the curve is going to be different. It's going to have to do with partial differential information about your original function, the function whose graph this is, and it's going to look pretty similar to the local linearization case, just you know, added complexity so we have to add a few more steps in there. And I'll see you next video talking about that.",math_multivariable-calculus_applications-of-multivariable-derivatives
" -  For this NMR, the molecular formula is C9H10O, let's go ahead and calculate the hydrogen deficiency index. So if we have nine carbons, the maximum number of hydrogens we can have, is two times nine plus two. And two times nine, plus two, is equal to 20, so for nine carbons, 20 hydrogens is the maximum number. Here we have only 10 hydrogens, so we are missing 10 hydrogens, or we're missing five pairs of hydrogens, therefore, the hydrogen deficiency index is equal to five. With an HDI of four or higher, you think benzene rings, so, I'm going to go ahead and draw a benzene ring in here because I'm pretty sure there's one in our molecule, and, if we look down here for this very complicated looking signal, it's really a bunch of overlapping signals from protons on the benzene ring, and I know that because we're in the aromatic proton region for our NMR. All right, so right in here. So I have five aromatic protons, let me go ahead and draw them in. So I put my five aromatic protons in slightly different environments, giving us overlapping signals, which give us this complicated looking one down here. All right, that takes care of an HDI of four, but we have an HDI of five, so we have one more thing, and it's, of course, going to be a double bond, and I know that because of this signal down here between nine and 10. Remember, a signal between nine and 10, that's the region for an aldehyde proton. So we have an aldehyde proton over here, so I draw in my carbonyl, and I draw in my hydrogen, and then this is another piece of the puzzle here. So this aldehyde is connected to something. All right, let's go to these other two signals down here, so this signal represents two protons, so I'm going to write a CH2 here. How many neighboring protons do we have for those two CH2 protons? Well, there's one, two, three peaks, so if there's three peaks, just subtract one to figure out how many neighboring protons you have. So three minus one, is equal to two. So this is a CH2 with two neighbors. It's the exact same thing for this signal, so this represents two protons, so this would be a CH2, and once again, we have three peaks, one, two, three. So three minus one is two, so this is a CH2 with two neighbors, and so these two CH2s must be right next to each other, so let me draw that out here. So if we have one CH2, next to another CH2, each of those CH2 protons have two neighbors, for example, if I think about these right here, right, how many neighboring protons? Well, this is the carbon next door, and I have two neighboring protons, so that makes sense when we look at the signal on the NMR. There's only one way to put together these different pieces of the puzzle, all right, so we would have to put a CH2 coming off this place on our benzene ring, and then another CH2, and then finally, our aldehyde, so I'll go ahead and draw in our aldehyde like that. So that must be the structure of our molecule. So a little bit about this aldehyde proton, let me go ahead and highlight it over here. So this aldehyde proton right here, or right here, we only see a singlet on the NMR spectrum, but it does have two neighbors, all right, so let me go ahead and draw in the neighboring proton. So they're on this carbon right here, so if we're thinking about the aldehyde proton, this is the carbon next door, and so we have two neighboring protons, and with two neighbors, you might think we would get some splitting for the signal for this aldehyde proton here, but we don't notice any on the NMR, and normally you don't see any splitting, because the coupling constant is usually very small, and so therefore, the signal, often it looks like it's a singlet, but sometimes, if you zoom in, you can observe some splitting for the aldehyde proton. For this NMR, we have a signal four two protons, so that must be a CH2, and how many neighboring protons? Well, for this signal we have four peaks, one, two, three, four, so four minus one is three, so three neighboring protons for these two CH2 protons. What about the chemical shift for this signal? So the chemical shift is getting close to four parts per million, and in that range, that makes us think about those protons being bonded to a carbon that's bonded to an electronegative atom. And if we look at our molecular formula, the only electronegative atom we see on here is oxygen, so that oxygen must be bonded to this carbon, so let's go ahead and draw that. So that oxygen is bonded to that carbon, and that carbon is bonded to two hydrogens, so that's what we have so far. So the oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, the oxygen is withdrawing some electron density from these two protons, giving us a higher value for the chemical shift. So this signal for these two protons in magenta, is right here. Next, let's look at this signal. So we have three protons, so a CH3, how many neighboring protons? Well, for our signal, we see, one, two, three peaks, so three minus one is two, so two neighboring protons. And so two neighboring protons must be the ones in magenta. So we can go ahead and put our methyl group on here, and let's use red for the methyl protons, so these three methyl protons are giving us this signal. We predicted two neighbors, and those neighboring protons, are the ones in magenta right here. So those are the two neighbors. For the ones in magenta, all right, we predicted three neighbors, and so that's one, two, and three. Finally, let's look at the last signal, so we only have one more proton to think about, there's only one place to put it, right, it must go on the oxygen. So this represents... This is the NMR spectrum for an alcohol, for ethanol. So this, this proton in blue, is this signal on the NMR spectrum. And the chemical shift is hard to predict for an alcoholic proton. Usually you see two to five parts per million, but it's really hard to predict exactly where this signal is going to appear. And also, let's think about how many neighboring protons this proton in blue has. All right, so the carbon next door has two neighbors, so you would think, you would expect two plus one peaks. If N is equal to two, two plus one gives us three, so we would expect a triplet for this signal, but we only see a singlet. And that's because this proton, this alcoholic proton, rapidly passes from one molecule to another, and this proton transfer is so fast, that the proton never stays in place long enough to interact with these neighboring protons, and so the NMR machine usually doesn't show any splitting. Under the right conditions, it is possible for splitting of the alcoholic proton to occur, and you might see a triplet here. But on most NMRs, you're only going to see a singlet, which is another clue on your NMR spectrum.",science_organic-chemistry_spectroscopy-jay
" -  All right, in this video we're going to be talking about what is plasma cell dyscrasia? I want to start by just breaking down the term. And the first word in here that kind of sticks out to a lot of people is this dyscrasia here. And this is a word that isn't frequently used and not well understood and so I'm really going to just cross it out and write dysfunction. Because plasma cell dyscrasia is a group of disorders that is characterized by dysfunction of plasma cells. So what exactly are plasma cells? In a simple definition, plasma cells are a type of blood cell that help the body fight infection. So let's go through some of these blood cells to figure out what exactly plasma cells are and how they work. There's three main types of blood cells. And the first type I'm going to mention here are the red blood cells, which are also known as erythrocytes. They look something a little bit like this. And red blood cells, or erythrocytes, are responsible for the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. And the next type of blood cells I'm going to mention are the platelets, which are also know as thrombocytes. And thrombocytes are kind of some fragments of their precursor cells, so I'm just going to kind of draw them in like this, they're very small. And what they do is they help the blood clot. So if you get a cut and you start bleeding, platelets, or thrombocytes, help the body stop that bleeding, so just writing clotting here. And then the other major type of blood cell is white blood cells. And white blood cells are kind of like the infection fighters of the body, but unlike erythrocytes and thrombocytes, which are a specific cell type on their own, white blood cells is more of a group of a bunch of different types of cells. And they can be further split into two categories and these are the myelocytes, which include cells like basophils and nutrophils and eosinophils, as well as lymphocytes, and these include things like T cells and B cells, as well as our plasma cells. But you may be asking yourself what are the difference between these two groups of white blood cells and why am I making a point to separate them? Well, the major thing is how they approach their infection fighting. What's their strategy? And myelocytes are part of a strategy that's know as innate, which means it's nonspecific. So anytime the body is injured or has a potential infection the action of these myelocytes is the same regardless of what that type of injury or infection is. They have the same response. Whereas lymphocytes are adaptive, or specific. And lymphocytes have a very targeted strategy for destroying and removing infections from the body. And another important characteristic of lymphocytes is that they have memory. All right, so now that we've kind of figured out what plasma cells are and we know that plasma cell dyscrasia is a dysfunction of them, what exactly does this all mean? And let's use a-- I'm just going to erase my work here and then we're going to use an example to kind of figure this out. So imagine you're in your kitchen chopping ups some vegetables for dinner and maybe you're listening to some music on the radio and your favorite song comes on and you're not exactly paying attention and there you go, you cut your hand and it starts bleeding, but what are some of the other first symptoms that you're going to experience when you cut your hand here with that knife? Well some of the things are probably going to be pain, maybe some swelling, some redness around the cut, as well as some warmth. And these symptoms here, these are that innate immune system. Those myelocytes release certain factors that cause these symptoms to occur. And it's called innate or nonspecific because it doesn't matter whether you cut yourself, or you have a cold, or you have any other sort of chance where there could be an infection, the body has these responses, this pain, swelling, redness, and warmth that make it difficult for a bacteria to survive. So they're not specific to any one type of bacteria. But what if that knife wasn't very clean? What if there was some bacteria on it? Well if the cut becomes infected with a bacteria, say here. This innate immune system is probably not going to be sufficient to kill and remove this bacteria from the body. And so this is where the adaptive immune system comes into play. So all bacteria and different cells on their surface have markers. And these markers are called antigens. And it's these antigens that identify this bacteria as something that is foreign, it is not part of the body. And the body has these cells that are known as B cells and these B cells have receptors on them, as you can see here. And they recognize the antigens. And when a B cell recognizes an antigen, say on a bacteria like from the knife that cut your hand, they start to transform into a couple different types of cells. And the first type that they turn into are plasma cells. And what plasma cells do is they produce antibodies. And these antibodies then attach to the antigens on the bacteria cell surface. So let's see that happen here. And the other pathway that the B cells goes down is to create another type of cell known as a memory B cell. So once these antibodies have attached to the antigens on the bacteria, the immune system is better able to kill and remove this bacteria from the body and thus fight the infection. Now that we've talked about what plasma cells are and what they do, you can imagine that if these cells were dysfunctional, as in a plasma cell dyscrasia, or dysfunction, that there's likely going to be a problem with anitbodies and if there's a problem with antibodies, perhaps an individual with a plasma cell dsycrasia will have a hard time fighting an infection and this indeed is the case in some plasma cell dyscrasias, such as multiple myeloma. But in some of the other plasma cell dyscrasias, this function isn't as prominent and what's more noticed is changes in the blood concentration and type of antibodies. And some of these conditions include something known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. That's a little bit of a mouthful, so it's usually just abbreviated MGUS, a condition known as Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and another one known as Langerhans cell histiocytosis. So these are the diseases that are known as plasma cell dyscrasias and they are caused by dysfuction of these antibody producing blood cells that are known as plasma cells.",science_health-and-medicine_hematologic-system-diseases-2
" - We're told, divide the polynomials. The form of your answer should either be just a clean polynomial, or some polynomial plus some constant over x plus two, where p of x is a polynomial and k is an integer. Fair enough, and if we were doing this on Khan Academy, this is a screen shot from Khan Academy, we would have to type this in, but we're just going to do it by hand. And, like always, pause this video and try to do it on your own before we work through it together. All right, now let's work through it together. And what we're trying to do is divide x plus two, into three x to the third power plus four x squared minus three x plus seven. And so, like always, we focus on the highest degree terms first. x goes into three x to the third power how many times? Three x squared times. We'd want to put that in the second degree column. Three x squared. Three x squared times two is six x squared. Three x squared times x is three x to the third power. There's something very meditative about algebraic long division. Anyway, we'd want to subtract what we just wrote from what we have up here. So let's subtract. And these characters cancel out. And then four x squared minus six x squared is negative two x squared. Bring down that negative three x. And now we would wanna say, hey, how many times does x go into negative two x squared? Well, it would go negative two x times. Put that in our first degree column. Negative two x times two is negative four x. Negative two x times x is negative two x squared. Now we wanna subtract what we have here in orange from what we have up here in teal. So we either put a negative around the whole thing or we distribute that negative and that becomes a positive, that becomes a positive. And so this is equal to, the x squared terms cancel out. Negative three x plus four x is just going to be a straight up x. Bring down that seven, x plus seven. How many times does x go into x? Well, one time. Actually, let me do a, use a new color here. So, how many times does x go into x? It goes one time. Put that in the constant column. One times two is two. One times x is x. We wanna subtract these characters. And we're left with seven minus two is five. And so, we can rewrite this whole thing as, we deserve I guess a little bit of a drum roll. Three x squared minus two x plus one, plus the remainder, five, over x plus two. One way to think about it is, hey, I have this remainder, I'd have to keep dividing it by x plus two if I really wanted to figure out exactly what this is. Now if I wanted these expressions to be completely identical I would put a condition on the domain that x cannot be equal to negative two because if x was equal to negative two, we'd be dividing by zero here. But for the purposes of this exercise, you just have to input this part right over here, you'd have to type it in, which I guess isn't the easiest thing to do in the world. But it's worth doing. All right, see you in the next video.",math_math3_poly-div
" Let's see if we can write 0.0727 as a fraction. Now, let's just think about what places these are in. This is in the tenths place. This is in the hundredths place. This 2 is in the thousandths place. And this 7 right here, this last 7, is in the ten-thousandths place. So there's a couple of ways we can do this. The way I like to think of this, this term over here is in the ten-thousandths place. We can view this whole thing right over here as 727 ten-thousandths because this is the smallest place right over here. So let's just rewrite it. This is equal to 727 over 10,000. And we've already written it as a fraction. And I think that's about as simplified as we can get. This number up here is not divisible by 2. It's not divisible by 5. In fact, it's not divisible by 3, which means it wouldn't be divisible by 6 or 9. It doesn't even seem to be divisible by 7. It might be a prime number. But I think we are done.",math_arithmetic_arith-decimals
" -  In this video we're going to talk about one of the most important ideas in mathematics and that's whether order matters when you multiply two numbers. So for example, is three times four the same thing as four times three? Are these two things equal to each other? And regardless of whether these two are equal to each other, is it always the case that if I have some number times some other number, if I swap the order am I going to get an equivalent number? Well, pause this video and see if you can work through that. Try to think about that a little bit before we think through it together. Well, let's think through this particular example. And we're going to do so with the help of some angry cats. So we clearly see some angry cats here. Meow. Yes, they are angry. We could view this as three groups of four. So this is one group right over here of angry cats, four angry cats. This is two groups of four angry cats. And this is three groups of four angry cats if we view the first number here as groups of the second number. But we could also view it as four groups of three. How would we do that? Well, we could have one group of three angry cats. We can have two groups of three angry cats. We can have three groups of three angry cats. And we could of course have four groups of three angry cats. So based on that, if you think of it, the first number as groups of the second number, well, it seems like the order doesn't matter. Another way you could think about it is here you have four rows of three angry cats. You have one, two, three, four rows of one, two, three angry cats. And so to figure out how many total cats you have, you multiply four times three. But you could view this same group of angry cats but just view it with a slightly different perspective. So here we have our angry cats. And then let me rotate our angry cats, probably risking making them a little bit angrier. Let me move them back in. And now, we could view this as three rows, one, two, three, of four cats in each row. So let me put all of these upright. So we have one, two, three rows of one, two, three, four cats. Don't wanna look at those 'cause it might make us a little bit confused. And we're dealing with the exact same number of cats. And so I'm only dealing with three and four here but what you will see is order doesn't matter when you are multiplying two numbers. And we could also see that on a number line. And we could do that with multiple examples. I'll keep a couple of angry cats here looking at us just to keep us in check. If we wanna think about three times four we could view it as four threes. So three, six, nine, 12. Or we could view it as three fours. Four, eight, and 12. And I focused a lot on three and four but we could do it with any two numbers that we're trying to multiply together. So let's say we wanted to do that with, I don't know, let's see whether six times four, whether it's the same thing as four times six. Well, you could view it as six fours. Four, eight, 12, 16, 20, and then 24. Or you could view it as four sixes. One six, 12, 18, and 24. So big takeaway, order doesn't matter when you are multiplying numbers like this. And this is sometimes referred to as the commutative property. It's a fancy word but it's really just saying that whether you're doing six times four or four times six the commutative property of multiplication says, ""Hey, those two things ""are going to be equivalent."" Meow. Yes, they are angry for being rotated.",math_pre-algebra_pre-algebra-arith-prop
" -  So let's say we're in a very simplified world where we have two countries, Country A and Country B and they're each capable of producing apples or baas or some combination of them and what this chart tells us if Country A put all their energy behind apples in a day they could produce three apples, and if they put all of their energy behind baas in a day they could produce six baas. Similarly, Country B, if they put all of their energy behind apples in a day they could produce two apples, and Country B if they put all of their energy behind baas in a day they could produce four baas. So given this, who has the comparative advantage in apples and who has the comparative advantage in baas and how should they trade? Pause this video and try to figure it out on your own. All right so when we're thinking about comparative advantage we really want to think about, well, what is the opportunity cost of producing an apple in each country and what is the opportunity cost of producing a baa in each country? And so let me make another little subcolumn right over here. Opportunity cost, and so what is the opportunity cost of an apple in Country A? And pause this video at any point if you get inspired. Well, to produce three apples they would have to trade off six baas. And so that means that per apple, they are not producing two baas. So this is two baas, two baas. I'll just write bana, baas per apple. And their opportunity cost for baas is just going to be the reciprocal of that. So one over two apples, apples per baa and then for Country B we can do a similar calculation and you might be noticing something interesting is about to happen. What's Country B's opportunity cost of apples? Well, one way to think about it, if they produce two apples, that means they're giving up four baas. Or they're giving up two baas per apple. So two baas, baas per apple. And once again, if we want to think in terms of the opportunity cost of a baa, well, to produce four baas they're giving up two apples. So this is one half of an apple per baa. Per, I'll just write, baa right over there. So this one is a little bit interesting. They have the same opportunity cost for apples in terms of baas, and they have the some opportunity cost for baas in terms of apples. And so because they have the same opportunity costs. So let me write this down, same opportunity costs. There is no comparative advantage. So no comparative advantage in either. Advantage in either. And so based on our very simple model here there are no gains from trade. Another way we could visualize this that maybe makes it maybe hopefully a little bit more clear. So let me make one axis here. I'm trying to draw a straight line, all right. And then this is my other axis right over here. And let's make this one right over here, this horizontal one let's make this the apples axis and let's make the vertical one the baas axis. And we're saying per day and this of course is apples per day and so if we look at Country A. Let me do Country A in a new color. So Country A, let's say orange. If they put all their energy behind apples they could produce one, two. Let me spread this out a little bit. They could produce one, two, three apples in a day. If they put all their energy behind baas they could produce, let's just say this is two, four, six. So that's six, this is four, this is two. This is three right over here. Let me put markers in-between to make this clear. So if they put all of their energy into baas they could produce six in a day and so their production possibilities if we assume it is a linear trade-off would look something like this and the slope right over here, this would be the opportunity cost. So the slope right over here, every time we increase apples by one we decrease baas by two. So in this situation, we would have, so the slope here is equal to, well, it's actually a negative slope. It's equal to negative two baas, baas per apple. So this right over here, this slope based on how I picked the axes, this is giving me the opportunity cost for apples in terms of baas. Every time I increase an apple how many baas am I actually giving up? So that is my opportunity cost there. And now if we think about Country B. Let me do this in a new color. I'm running out of colors. Country B right over here they could either produce four baas or two apples or things in-between. But notice, it has the exact same slope The slope is the opportunity cost. And if we switch these axes right over here then the slope would be the opportunity cost for baas in terms of apples, but the big takeaway here, if you see the production possibilities of two countries and we're talking about two goods and they have the same slope, then that means their opportunity costs are going to be the same, and there's not going to be a gain from trade. Remember, the whole point of comparative advantage and trading is that both countries will benefit. That's really the big takeaway here. But there are situations where both countries wouldn't benefit because they have the same opportunity cost and this was an example of one of them. Now the other case, sometimes one will have a comparative advantage over the other. They do have different opportunity costs and then you might have no gains from trade. Maybe there's some way that they can't know each other's opportunity costs. There's some way that they don't trade. Maybe irrespective of what the models tell us about comparative advantage some country says, hey, I don't want to produce baas. Apples are the future, that's a higher skilled industry, whatever else, so there's definitely scenarios, especially even in our model, in our very simplified model where there might not be gains from trade. And the classic one of course is when there's no comparative advantage and both countries have the same opportunity costs in the goods.",economics-finance-domain_ap-microeconomics_basic-economic-concepts
" -  We're told that Linde isn't sure how to subtract 853. We are told Linde isn't sure how to subtract 853 minus 283. Help Linde by choosing an expression that is the same as 853 minus 283. So pause this video and see if you can answer it on your own before we work through it together. All right. Now when we look at all of the choices, they all start with 853. Now, this first choice, they subtract out 200. That makes sense 'cause we have 200s right over there. Then they subtract out 50 and then they subtract out three. So the 200 and the three make sense. You can view 853 minus 283 as 853 minus 200s minus 80, eight 10s right here, minus three. But that's not what they wrote in here. Instead of putting an 80 here, they put a 50, so we can rule that out. Here we have 253 minus 20 minus 800 minus three. Well, this is a little bit strange because we don't have two 10s, we have 200s, and we don't have 800s, we have eight 10s, so this is also incorrect. Now, it's probably going to be this one, but let's just make sure we feel comfortable with this. So this one has 853 minus 200 minus 50 minus 30. Does that make sense? Well, let's think about it. What they're doing is that they're subtracting out first the 200, so that's this part right over here, so that makes sense, they're subtracting out first that. And then they're subtracting out 53 and then they're subtracting out 30. Well, that is the same thing as subtracting out 83 'cause subtracting 83 is the same thing as subtracting out 53, and then subtracting 30. 53 plus 30 is 83. Now, you might be wondering, why would they even do it this way? What's easier to do in your head? 853 minus 200 is 653. You take away 53 from that, so you take away 53 from that, and you're going to be left with 600, and then 600 minus 30, you might recognize that, you could use the 60 10s minus three 10s, this is gonna be 57 10s or you might be able to do it in your head, 600 minus 30 is 570. So that's why they broke out, they broke up the 83. Instead of just breaking it up into 80 and three, they broke it up into 53 and 30 to match this 53 over here, and so it was easier to work out the result. Let's do another example. So here we're asked to fill in the blank. They say 143 minus 79 is the same as blank minus 80. So pause this video and see if you can figure this out. So the key here is to realize is that when you have a difference here, as long as you add or subtract the same amount to both of these, the difference will be the same. So it looks like they tried to turn the 79 into, it looks like they turned the 79 into an 80 by adding one, and so if we want the difference to be the same, we would add one to the 143 as well. So 143 plus one is 144. If we add one to both of these numbers, the difference would be the same. And we're done. So, it's 144 minus 80.",math_cc-third-grade-math_imp-addition-and-subtraction
" We already have the tools in our tool kit to factor something like x squared plus 4x minus 5. And the way that we've already thought about it is we've said, hey, let's think of two numbers that if we were to take their product, we'd get negative 5. And if we were to add the two numbers, we'd get positive 4. And the fact that their product is negative tells you one of them is going to be positive and one of them is going to be negative. And so there's a couple of ways you could think about it. Well, you could say, well, maybe one of the numbers is negative 1 and then the other one is positive 5. Actually, this one seems to work. Negative 1 times 5 is negative 5. Negative 1 plus 5 is positive 4. So this one actually seems to work. The other option would have been-- since we're just going to deal with the factors of 5, and 5's a prime number, the other option would have been something like 1 and negative 5. There's only two factors for 5. So 1 and negative 5-- their product would have been negative 5. But if you were to add these two numbers, you would have gotten a negative 4 right over here. So we're going to go with this right over here. And so this tells us that if we want to factor this using the tools that we already know about, we will get-- And let me write these numbers in a different color so we can keep track of them. So negative 1 and 5. We know that this would factor out to be x minus 1 times x plus 5. And you can verify this for yourself that if you were to multiply this out, you will get x squared plus 4x minus 5. You can even see this here. x times x is x squared. Negative x plus 5x is going to be 4x. And then negative 1 times 5 is negative 5. Fair enough. This is all review for us at this point. Now I want to tackle something a little bit more interesting. Let's say we wanted to factor x squared plus 4xy minus 5y squared. And at first, this looks really daunting. All of a sudden, I've introduced a y and a y squared here. I have two variables. How would I tackle it? But the important thing is to just take a deep breath and realize that we're not fundamentally doing something different. Now, the one little tricky thing I've done when I've written it this way-- and I encourage you to pause this and try this on your own before I explain any further. But the one tricky thing I did right over here is I wrote the x before the y. And that tends to be the convention. You just write them kind of in alphabetical order. But if we wanted it in a form that's a little bit closer to this and something that would fit this mold a little bit more is if we swapped these two. Because then we could write it as x squared plus 4yx minus 5y squared. And now it becomes pretty clear that this 4y term right over here-- this right over here is the coefficient on the x term, the same way that 4 was the coefficient on x right here. And this negative 5y squared corresponds to the negative 5 right over here. So we can do the exact same thought process. Let's think of two-- now not just numbers. They're going to have variables in them. Let's think of two terms or two expressions that if I multiply them, I get negative 5y squared. And then when I take the sum, I get 4y. So let's think about how we could do this. So one option would be positive. Let's say positive y and negative 5y. So where would this take us? Positive y times negative 5y would indeed be equal to negative 5y squared. But then if I add y to negative 5y, I'm going to get negative 4y. So this doesn't work. But let's see if we swap the two signs. So what about negative y and positive 5y? Well, here, if I take the product of negative y and 5y, it will be negative 5y squared. And if I take the sum negative y and 5y, it will be positive 4y. So we know how to factor it now. So once again, let me put this in the same color. So this I'm going to put in this mauve color, this light purple. And this I'll put in a darker purple. So now we know how to factor this. And this is the same exact mold that we did up here, same exact idea. This is going to be x. Instead of just a minus 1 here, now we've factored-- here we factored into a negative 1 and a 5. Here we factored into a negative y and 5y. So instead of a negative 1, it's going to be a negative y, x minus y times x plus 5y. And we can verify that when you multiply this out, it indeed does equal x squared plus 4xy minus 5y. Let me do that here just so we know for sure. So x times x is going to be x squared. Let me do everything in a different color. x times 5y is going to be plus 5xy. Then negative y times x is negative yx. And then finally-- and I'm running out of colors-- if we take negative y times 5y, that's negative 5y squared. And now we just have to simplify. We have to combine these middle two terms right over here. And at first, it looks a little bit-- this is xy. This is yx. It's not so obvious. But we just have to rewrite it. This is the same thing as 5yx minus yx. And so here, you're saying, look, I have 5yx's. And I'm going to subtract yx's. So I'm going to have 4yx's. So this is just going to be 4yx's. I have 5yx's. Take out another yx. I'm going to have 4yx's. So this is going to be x squared plus 4yx minus 5y squared. And it all works out.",math_algebra-home_alg-polynomials
" We've see now that we can apply linear transformations in different coordinate systems. The transformations that we've been performing before have all been with respect to the standard basis. So in the last video I said, look, in standard coordinates, if you have some vector x in your domain and you apply some transformation, then let's say that A is the transformation matrix with respect to the standard basis, then you're just going to have this mapping. You take x, you multiply it by A, you're going to get the transformation of x. Now, in the last video and in a couple of videos before that, or actually the one right before that, we said, well, look. You can do the same mapping, but just in an alternate coordinate system. You could do it in some coordinate system with respect to some basis B, and that should be the same thing. It should just be a different transformation matrix. And in the last video, we actually figured out what that different transformation matrix is. We had a change of basis, so let's say we had this basis right here. Let me actually copy and paste everything so that we understand what we did. So this was the example. Let me copy it. Let me paste it up here, put all of our takeaways from the last video up here and paste it right here. For the last video we said, OK, this is my basis right there. And then we said-- let me copy and paste. That was my alternate basis, and then I have my change of basis matrix and it's inverse. Those will be useful to deal with, so let me copy and paste that. OK, copy, And then I'm going to paste it. Edit, paste. Maybe I'll just write it over there. Not maybe the best order, maybe I should have written that first, but I think we get the idea. Then we want to write what our transformation matrix is with respect to the standard basis. And I wrote that write over here. This was all from the last problem, if you're wondering where I got all this stuff. Let me copy and then paste that. Edit, paste. So I'll paste that. And then the whole point of the last video is we figured out what the transformation matrix is with respect to this basis right here. So D, which was the big takeaway from the last video, was equal to this right here. Let me copy and paste that. Copy and paste. And so now we have all of our takeaways in one place. Edit, paste. What I want to do in this video is verify that D actually works, that I could start with some vector x-- let me write it up here. Let's take some example vector. So this transformation, it's entire domain is R2, so let's start with some vector x. Let's say that x is equal to 1 minus 1. Now, we could just apply the transformation in the traditional way and get the transformation of x. Let's just do that. The transformation of x is just this matrix times x. And so what is that going to equal? Let me see. Maybe I can just do it right here in this corner to save space. So it's going to be this matrix times x. So this first term right here is going to be 3 times 1 plus minus 2 times minus 1, or plus 2, right? Minus 2 times minus 1 is just 2, so it's going to be 3 plus 2, so it's going to be equal to 5. And then the second term right here is going to be 2 times 1 plus minus 2 times minus 1. Well, that's just positive 2, so it's going to be 2 plus 2, so that is 4. So that's just the transformation of x. Now, what is this vector x represented in coordinates, or I guess you could say, this alternate basis coordinates? So what is that vector x represented in coordinates with respect to this basis right here? Well, you saw it before. I wrote them out here. Maybe it'll be useful to do it right here. I'll copy this. Actually, let me copy both of these. These will both be useful. Edit, copy. As you can see, if you want to go from x to the x in an alternate basis or the alternate coordinate representations of x, you essentially multiply x times C inverse, so that's why I'm copying and pasting it. Let me copy, and then let me put it up here so that we can apply these, then paste it right there. So if we want to go from x to the B coordinates of x, I take my x and I multiply it times C inverse. C inverse is this thing right here. So if I take x and I multiply it times C inverse I'l get this version of x. So let's do that. So this times that. Let me just put the minus 1/3 out front. It's going to be equal to minus 1/3 times-- let's see if we can do this one in our head as well. So it's going to be 1 times 1 plus minus 2 times minus 1, which is just positive 2. So it's going to be 1 plus 2, so it's going to be equal to 3. And then it's minus 2 times 1, which is minus 2 plus 1 times minus 1, which is just minus 1. So it's minus 2 minus 1, so it's minus 3. So if we have minus 1/3 times this, the B coordinate representation of our vector x is going to be equal to minus 1 and then 1, just like that, which is actually interesting for this example. It just kind of swapped the first entry and the second entry. Now, let's see what happens when we apply D to x. So if we apply D to x, D should be our transformation matrix if we're dealing in the B coordinates. So let's see what happens. If we apply D to x-- let me scroll over a little bit, just so we get a little bit more real estate. So if we apply D to x, what do we get? And so this is going to be the transformation, or this should be the transformation of x in B coordinates. So what is this going to be equal to? You have to multiply this times D. So it's going to be minus 1 times minus 1, which is 1, plus 0 times 1. So it's just minus 1 times minus 1, which is 1. And then we're going to get 0 times minus 1 plus 2 times 1, so 2 times 1 is just 2. Now, for everything to work together and assuming I haven't made any careless mistakes, this thing, this is vector right here should be the same as this vector if I change my basis, so if I go from the standard basis to the basis B. When you go in that direction, you just multiply this guy times C inverse. And I'm just using this formula right here. If I'm in the standard basis and I multiply by C inverse, I'm going to get the B basis. So let's see what I get. So this guy, I'm going to multiply him times C inverse. Let me do it up here just to get some extra space. So I'm going to multiply the vector 5, 4. I'm going to multiply that by C inverse. We're going to have minus 1/3 times 1 minus 2 minus 2, 1, just like that. So this is going to be equal to-- Ill just write the minus 1/3 out front. We have 1 times 5, which is 5, plus minus 2 times 4, so 5 minus 8. And then we have minus 2 times 5, which is minus 10. And then we have plus 1 times 4. Minus 2 times 5, which is minus 10, plus 1 times 4: plus 4. So this is equal to minus 1/3 times minus 3, and this is what? This is minus 6. If you multiply the minus 1/3 times it, all the negatives cancel out, and you get 1 and 2, which is exactly what we needed to get. When you take this guy and you change it's basis to basis B or you change its coordinate system to the coordinate system with respect to B, you multiply it by C inverse, you get that right there. So literally is the B coordinate representation of the transformation of x. We just did it by multiplying it by C inverse, which is exactly what we got when we took the B coordinate version of x and we applied that matrix that we found, the transformation matrix with respect to the B coordinates, and you multiply it times this guy right here. We got the same answer. So it didn't matter whether we went this way around the little cycle or we went this way. We got the same answer. This isn't a proof, but it shows us that what we did in the last video at least works for this case, and I literally did pick a random x here. And you can verify it, if you like, for other things. Now, you should hopefully be reasonably convinced that we can do this, that you can change your basis and find a transformation matrix. We've shown how to do it, but the obvious question is 1why do you do it? 1And someone actually wrote a comment on the last video, 1which I think kind of captures the art of why you do it. 1I'm not looking at the comment right now, but if I remember 1correctly, they said their linear algebra teacher said 1that linear algebra is the art of choosing the right basis. 1Let me write that down. 1Or you could imagine, the right coordinate system. 1And why is there a right coordinate system? 1Maybe I'll put little quotes inside the quotation. 1What does it mean to have the right coordinate system? 1Well, if you look at your original transformation matrix 1with respect to the standard basis, it's fine. 1It's got this 2 by 2. 1But if you performed matrix operations with this, you've 1go to do some math. 1And if you had to perform it over and over, if you have to 1perform it on a bunch of vectors, it is what it is. 1But when you transfer your bases, when you go to a new 1basis, when you went to this basis right here, all of a 1sudden, you find that the transformation 1matrix is much simpler. 1It's a diagonal matrix. 1When you multiply a diagonal matrix times something, you're 1literally just taking its scaling factors of the first 1and second terms. When you multiply this guy times some 1vector-- we did it here. 1When you multiplied this guy times this vector, you 1literally just scaled the first term times minus 1 and 1you scaled the second term by 2. 1So it's a much simpler operation. 1And you might say, hey, but we had to do all of that work of 1multiplying by C inverse to get there, and then once you 1get this answer, you're going to multiply by C to go back 1into standard coordinates, you know, that's a lot more work 1than just what you save here. 1But imagine if you had to apply D multiple times. 1Imagine if you had to apply D times D times D times D to x. 1Let me say it this way. 1Imagine if you had to apply A times A times A or you have to 1apply A 100 times to some vector up here, then applying 1A 100 times to some vector would be much more 1computationally intensive than applying D 100 times to this 1vector, even though you had a little bit of overhead from 1converting in this direction and then converting back. 1So in a lot of problems, especially in computer science 1frankly, or some other applications you might be 1doing, you want to pick the right basis. 1The computations for many problems get a lot simpler if 1you pick the right coordinate system.",math_linear-algebra_alternate-bases
" -  Let's talk a little bit about arteries and veins and the roles they play in the circulatory system. So I want you to pause this video and first think to yourself, Do you have a sense of what arteries and veins are? Well one idea behind arteries and veins are that well, in most of these drawings, arteries are drawn in red, and I even made the artery word here in red. And veins are drawn in blue. And so maybe that represents how much oxygen they have. And so one possible explanation is that arteries carry oxygenated blood, oxygenated, oxygenated blood, while veins carry deoxygenated blood. So blood that has less oxygen now. Now this is actually incorrect. It is, many times, the case that arteries are the ones carrying oxygenated blood and veins are carrying the deoxygenated blood. But as we will see, this is not always the case. And since we're already talking about oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood and the colors red and blue, it's worth addressing another misconception. Many times it is said that deoxygenated blood looks blue, and the reason why people believe that is if you look at your wrist and you're able to see some of the vessels in there, you will see some blue vessels. And those, or at least they look blue when you're looking from the outside of your skin. And those, indeed, are veins. And so that's where the misconception has come from, that veins, which, in your arm, are carrying deoxygenated blood. That that deoxygenated blood is blue. It turns out that it is not blue. It is just a deeper red. And the reason why the veins look blue is because of the optics of light going through your skin and then seeing the outside of the veins and then reflecting back. That is not the color of the actual blood. So so far I have not given you a clear definition of what arteries versus veins are. A better definition, so let me cross these two out, are that arteries carry blood away from the heart. Away from the heart. And veins carry blood towards the heart. Towards the heart. And I can get a zoomed in image of the heart right here and that will make it a little bit clearer. And you can also see, or we're about to see, why this first definition, or this first distinction between arteries and veins does not always hold. So let's just imagine some blood that is being pumped away from the heart. So right when it gets pumped away from the heart, it'll be right over here. It gets pumped through the aorta, and you can see the aorta branches, so some blood can go up towards your head, and if it didn't, you would pass out and die. And then a lot of the blood goes down towards the rest of your body. And that, indeed, is the most oxygenated blood. And so it'll flow through your body. And these arteries will keep branching and branching into smaller vessels, all the way until they form these very small branches. And it's that place, especially, where they will lose a lot of their oxygen to the fluid and the cells around them. And then the blood is less oxygenated. And then even though deoxygenated blood is not blue, it often gets depicted as blue in a lot of diagrams. So I will do the same. And these vessels start building into your veins. And these really small vessels that really bridge between arteries and veins, where a lot of the gas and nutrient exchange occurs, these are called capillaries. And so after going through the capillaries, the blood will then come back to the heart and now it's coming towards the heart through the veins. It comes into the right atrium, then the right ventricle. Then that gets pumped towards the lungs. And this is the exception to the first incorrect definition of arteries and veins that we looked at. This right over here, is an artery. Even though it's carrying less oxygenated or deoxygenated blood, it's an artery because it's carrying blood away from the heart. But in this case, it's not carrying it to the rest of the body, it is carrying it to the lungs. That is why it is called the pulmonary artery, even though it's carrying less oxygenated blood. So that it goes to the lungs and then, in the lungs, there's more gas exchange that occurs. The blood gets oxygenated and then it comes back to the heart. And so it comes back to the heart in these vessels right over here, and that even though these are carrying highly oxygenated blood, these are considered veins because they're carrying blood towards the heart. So these are pulmonary veins. And then the cycle starts again. The pulmonary veins bring the oxygenated blood into the left atrium and the left ventricle, and then that pumps it to the rest of the body to the aorta, for your systemic circulation. You have your pulmonary circulation, which circulates the blood to, through and from the lungs. And you have your systemic circulation, which takes the blood to and from the rest of the body. So now that we have this main distinction between arteries and veins, what are some other interesting things that we know about it? Well one thing to keep in mind is that since arteries are being pumped directly by the heart towards the rest of the body, they have high pressure. I'll write that in caps. High pressure. And so if you were to have an accident of some type, which you do not want to have, and you were to accidentally cut an artery, because of that high pressure, it would actually spurt blood, a lot more than if you were to cut a vein. And most of the times where you get a cut, you're really just cutting capillaries. Like if you were to prick your finger, it's usually a series of capillaries that get cut, and that's why the blood would come out very very slowly. Now if arteries are high pressure, veins are low pressure. Low, low pressure. And one way to think about it is the arteries, the blood is being pumped directly by the heart. But then once it goes through the capillaries and comes back through the veins, it's kind of sluggishly making its way back to the heart. It's not being directly pumped. And that's why in veins, because you don't have that high pressure to bring everything back to the heart, you have these valves that make sure that for the most part, the blood is going in one direction. I'm going to draw the blood in red in the veins, just so we don't keep going with that misconception, that blood in the veins is blue somehow. Now related to the fact that the blood in the arteries is under higher pressure, in order to transport a fixed volume of blood in a certain amount of time, you need less volume. And so that's why arteries are low volume. And on the other hand, veins are high volume. And to appreciate the difference, the blood volume in arteries are only approximately 15% of the entire blood volume in your body, while the blood volume in veins are closer to 65%, approximately 65%. And if you're wondering where the rest of the blood is, about five percent is in capillaries, five percent is in your heart, and about 10% is in your lungs. So I will leave you there. The big take away: arteries are the vessels that take blood away from the heart. Veins are the vessels that take blood towards the heart.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" -  We are told figure two is a scaled copy of figure one. So this is figure two here. This is figure one. Looks like figure two not only has it been scaled down, it's a smaller version, but it also looks like it has been rotated 180 degrees or you can say it's been flipped upside down. We're asked to identify the side in figure two that corresponds to side EA in figure one. So this is EA in figure one. Pause this video and see if you can identify the side of figure two that corresponds to side EA in figure one. Alright, now let's work through this together. Some of you might immediately intuit or be able to spot which side corresponds to EA but I'll do it slightly more methodically in this video just so that we can see maybe all of the corresponding sides and points. So one way to think about it is well, it looks like the longest side in figure one is side BC. So this is the longest side in figure one and then the longest side in figure two is HL so it looks like BC corresponds to HL and then touching on that longest side, that longest side has two right angles. It forms two right angles with the sides next to it. So you have these two right angles right over here and then of those two right angles, you have the shorter side connected to the longest side and so that is BA over here and so that would correspond to LK right over here. That is the shorter side connected to the long side that forms a right angle and then if we just keep following that side of the shape, we then go to side AE which would correspond now to and this is answering our question to side KJ. So the side in figure two that corresponds to EA in figure one, that is going to be KJ or we could say side JK and if someone wanted to say what points correspond to which point, well, you can see that BA corresponds to LK and BC corresponds to LH so we would know for example that this point B right over here, point B would correspond to point L in figure two right over here and we could use a similar logic for the other points. So we've answered the questions, the question, but the real thing is to see well, which sides or points have similar features on a relative basis? So I said what is the longest side? What is the longest side? Where do we see right angles? And sometimes your brain might just immediately be able to spot out the shape. If you were to rotate this one all the way around, it would jump out at you a little bit faster that JK and AE are corresponding sides.",math_7th-engage-ny_engage-7th-module-4
" Here's the second problem from CK12.org's AP statistics FlexBook. It's an open source textbook, essentially. I'm using it essentially to get some practice on some statistics problems. So here, number 2. The grades on a statistics midterm for a high school are normally distributed with a mean of 81 and a standard deviation of 6.3. All right. Calculate the z-scores for each of the following exam grades. Draw and label a sketch for each example. We can probably do it all on the same example. But the first thing we'd have to do is just remember what is a z-score. What is a z-score? A z-score is literally just measuring how many standard deviations away from the mean? Just like that. So we literally just have to calculate how many standard deviations each of these guys are from the mean, and that's their z-scores. So let me do part a. So we have 65. So first we can just figure out how far is 65 from the mean. Let me just draw one chart here that we can use the entire time. So it's just our distribution. Let's see. We have a mean of 81. That's our mean. And then a standard deviation of 6.3. So our distribution, they're telling us that it's normally distributed. So I can draw a nice bell curve here. They're saying it's normally distributed, so that's as good of a bell curve as I'm capable of drawing. This is the mean right there at 81. And the standard deviation is 6.3. So one standard deviation above and below is going to be 6.3 away from that mean. So if we go 6.3 in the positive direction, that value right there is going to be 87.3. If we go 6.3 in the negative direction, where does that get us? What, 74.7? Right, if we add 6, it'll get us to 80.7, and then 0.3 will get us to 81. So that's one standard deviation below and above the mean, and then you'd add another 6.3 to go 2 standard deviations, so on and so forth. So that's a drawing of the distribution itself. So let's figure out the z-scores for each of these grades. 65 is how far? 65 is maybe going to be here someplace. So we first want to say, well how far is it just from our mean? So the distance is, you just want to positive number here. Well actually, you want a negative number. Because you want your z-score to be positive or negative. Negative would mean to the left of the mean and positive would mean to the right of the mean. So we say 65 minus 81. So that's literally how far away we are. But we want that in terms of standard deviations. So we divide that by the length or the magnitude of our standard deviation. So 65 minus 81. Let's see, 81 minus 65 is what? It is 5 plus 11. It's 16. So this is going to be minus 16 over 6.3. We'll take our calculator out. And let's see, if we have minus 16 divided by 6.3, you get minus 2 point-- oh, it's like 54. Approximately equal to minus 2.54. That's the z-score for a grade of 65. Pretty straightforward. Let's do a couple more. Let's do all of them. 83. So how is it away from the mean? Well, it's 83 minus 81. It's two grades above the mean. But we want it in terms of standard deviations. How many standard deviations. So this was part A. A was right here. We were 2.5 standard deviations below the mean. So this is part A. 1, 2, and then 0.5. So this was A right there, 65. And then part B, 83, 83 is going to be right here. A little bit higher, but right here. And the z-score here, 83 minus 81 divided by 6.3 will get us-- let's see, clear the calculator. So we have 83 minus 81 is 2 divided by 6.3. It's 0.32, roughly. So here we get 0.32. So 83 is 0.32 standard deviations above the mean. And so it would be roughly 1/3 third of the standard deviation along the way, right? Because this as one whole standard deviation. So we're 0.3 of a standard deviation above the mean. Choice number C. Or not choice, part C, I guess I should call it. 93. Well, we do the same exercise. 93 is how much above the mean? Well, it's 93 minus 81 is 12. But we want it in terms of standard deviations. So 12 is how many standard deviations above the mean? Well, it's going to be almost 2. Let's take the calculator out. So we get 12 divided by 6.3. It's 1.9 standard deviations. Its z-score is 1.9. Which means it's 1.9 standard deviations above the mean. So the mean is 81, we go one whole standard deviation, and then 0.9 standard deviations, and that's where a score of 93 would lie, right there. Its z-score is 1.9. And all that means is 1.9 standard deviations above the mean. Let's do the last one. I'll do it in magenta. D, part D. A score of 100. We don't even need the problem anymore. A score of 100. Well, same thing. We figure out how far is 100 above the mean-- remember, the mean was 81-- and we divide that by the length or the size or the magnitude of our standard deviation. So 100 minus 81 is equal to 19 over 6.3. So it's going to be a little over 3 standard deviations. And in the next problem we'll see what does that imply in terms of the probability of that actually occurring. But if we just want to figure out the z-score, 19 divided by 6.3 is equal to 3.01. So it's very close. 3.02, really, if I were to round. So it's very close to 3.02. Its z-score is 3.02, or a grade of 100 is 3.02 standard deviations above the mean. So remember, this was the mean right here at 81. We go 1 standard deviation above the mean, 2 standard deviations above the mean, the third standard deviation above the mean is right there. So we're sitting right there on our chart. A little bit above that, 3.02 standard deviations above the mean, that's where a score of 100 will be. And you can see the probability, the height of this-- that's what the chart tells us-- it's actually a very low probability. Actually, not just a very low probability of getting something higher than that. Because as we learned before, in a probably density function, if this is a continuous, not a discreet, the probability of getting exactly that is 0, if this wasn't discrete. But since this is scores on a test, we know that it's actually a discrete probability function. But the probability is low of getting higher than that, because you can see where we sit on the bell curve. Well anyway, hopefully this at least clarified how to solve for z-scores, which is pretty straightforward mathematically. And in the next video, we'll interpret z-scores and probabilities a little bit more.",math_statistics-probability_modeling-distributions-of-data
" - Do you want to evaluate the definite integral from three to three, of F of X, D X. And we're given the graph of F of X, and of Y equals F of X, and the area between F of X, and the X-axis over different intervals. Well when you look at this, you actually don't even have to look at this graph over here, because in general, if I have the definite integral of any function F of X, D X, from let's say, A to the same value, from one value to the same value, this is always going to be equal to zero. We're going from three to three. We could be going from negative pi to negative pi. It's always going to be zero. One way to think about it, we're starting and stopping here at three, so we're not capturing any area. Let's do another one. So here, we want to find the definite integral from seven to four, of F of X, D X. So we want to go from seven to four. So we want to go from seven to four. Now you might be tempted to say, okay well look, the area between F of X and X, is two, so maybe this thing is two. But the key realization is, this area only applies when you have the lower bound as the lower bound, and the higher value as the higher bound. So the integral from four to seven of F of X, D X, this thing. This thing is equal to two. This thing is depicting that area right over there. So what about this, where we've switched it? Instead of going from four to seven, we're going from seven to four. Well the key realization is, is if you switch the bounds, this is a key definite integral property, that's going to give you the negative value. So this is going to be equal to the negative of the integral from four to seven, of F of X, D X. And so this is going to be negative, and we just figured out the integral from four to seven of F of X, D X, well now that is this area. F of X is above the X-axis. It's a positive area. So it is going to be, so this thing right over here is going to evaluate to positive two, but we have that negative out front, so our original expression would evaluate to negative two.",math_integral-calculus_ic-integration
" -  So, we have a fifth-degree polynomial here, p of x, and we're asked to do several things. First, find the real roots. And let's sort of remind ourselves what roots are. So root is the same thing as a zero, and they're the x-values that make the polynomial equal to zero. So the real roots are the x-values where p of x is equal to zero. So, the x-values that satisfy this are going to be the roots, or the zeros, and we want the real ones. As you'll learn in the future, there's also going to be imaginary roots, or zeros, or there might be. Then we want to think about how many times, how many times we intercept the x-axis. Well as we'll see, however many real roots we have that's how many times we are going to intercept... However many unique real roots we have, that's however many times we're going to intercept the x-axis. How do I know that? Well, let's just think about an arbitrary polynomial here. So those are my axes. This is the x-axis, that's my y-axis. And let me just graph an arbitrary polynomial here. So, let's say it looks like that. Well, what's going on right over here. At this x-value, we see, based on the graph of the function, that p of x is going to be equal to zero. So that's going to be a root. This is also going to be a root, because at this x-value, the function is equal to zero. At this x-value the function's equal to zero. At this x-value the function is equal zero. If we're on the x-axis then the y-value is zero. So the function is going to be equal to zero. This is a graph of y is equal, y is equal to p of x. Not necessarily this p of x, but I'm just drawing some arbitrary p of x. So there's some x-value that makes the function equal to zero. Well, that's going to be a point at which we are intercepting the x-axis. So we want to know how many times we are intercepting the x-axis. As we'll see, it's gonna be the same number of real roots, or the same number of real zeros we have. And then they want us to figure out the smallest of those x-intercepts, and we'll figure it out for this particular polynomial. So, let me give myself a little bit more space. So, let's get to it. So we really want to solve p of x is equal to zero. So we really want to set, that right over there, equal to zero, and solve this. So we want to solve this equation. The x-values that make this equal to zero, if I input them into the function I'm gonna get the function equaling zero. All right. So the first thing that might jump out at you is that all of these terms are divisible by x. So I like to factor that out from the get-go. So, we can rewrite this as x times x to the fourth power plus nine x-squared minus two x-squared minus 18 is equal to zero. Now there's something else that might have jumped out at you. It actually just jumped out of me as I was writing this down is that we have two third-degree terms. After we've factored out an x, we have two second-degree terms. Now, it might be tempting to just add these two together, and actually that it would be a completely legitimate way of trying to factor this so that we can solve this equation. But instead of doing it that way, we might take this as a clue that maybe we can factor by grouping. Remember, factor by grouping, you split up that middle degree term and see if you can reverse the distributive property twice. So, let's see if we can do that. Can we group together these first two terms and factor something interesting out? And group together these second two terms and factor something interesting out? And then maybe we can factor something out after that. What am I talking about? Well, this is going to be the same thing as x times... Well, this one, actually let me write a big parenthesis, here, this one right over here is the same thing as... I can factor out an x-squared. So, it's gonna be x-squared plus... Sorry. It's gonna be x-squared, if I factor out an x-squared, I'm gonna get an x-squared plus nine. And then over here, if I factor out a, let's see, negative two. I don't want to... If I factor out a, yep, negative two, I'm gonna get, so minus two times... I'm gonna get an x-squared plus nine, again. Now this is interesting, because this is telling us maybe we can factor out an x-squared plus nine. So, let me factor out an x-squared plus nine from each of these terms, and I'm going to get, I am going to get x... I'll leave these big green parentheses here for now, If we factor out an x-squared plus nine, it's going to be x-squared plus nine times x-squared, x-squared minus two. X-squared minus two, and I gave myself a little bit too much space. So, let me delete that. So let me delete that right over there and then close the parentheses. Then close the parentheses. Actually, I can even get rid of those green parentheses now, if I want to, optimally, make this a little bit simpler. So far we've been able to factor it as x times x-squared plus nine times x-squared minus two. And the whole point that I'm factoring this is if I can find the product of a bunch of expressions equaling zero, then I can say, ""Well, the product of those expressions ""are going to be zero if one or more of those expressions ""are equal to zero"", and I can solve for x. Well, let's see. This one's completely factored. This one is completely factored if we're thinking about real roots. This one, you can view it as a difference of squares if you view two as a square root of two-squared. So, we can rewrite this as, and of course all of this is equal to zero. Let me just write equals. So we could write this as equal to x times times x-squared plus nine times... Let's see, I can factor this business into x plus the square root of two times x minus the square root of two. I'm just recognizing this as a difference of squares. And, once again, we just want to solve this whole, all of this business, equaling zero. All of this equaling zero. So how can this equal to zero? Well any one of these expressions, if I take the product, and if any one of them equals zero then I'm gonna get zero. So, x could be equal to zero. X could be equal to zero, and that actually gives us a root. When x is equal to zero, this polynomial is equal to zero, and that's pretty easy to verify. Let's see, can x-squared plus nine equal zero? X-squared plus nine equal zero. Well, if you subtract nine from both sides, you get x-squared is equal to negative nine. And that's why I said, there's no real solution to this. So, no real, let me write that, no real solution. There are some imaginary solutions, but no real solutions. Now, can x plus the square root of two equal zero? X plus the square root of two equal zero. Sure, if we subtract square root of two from both sides, you get x is equal to the negative square root of two. And can x minus the square root of two equal zero? Sure, you add square root of two to both sides, you get x is equal to the square root of two. So, there we have it. We have figured out our zeros. X could be equal to zero. P of zero is zero. P of negative square root of two is zero, and p of square root of two is equal to zero. So, those are our zeros. Their zeros are at zero, negative squares of two, and positive squares of two. And so those are going to be the three times that we intercept the x-axis. And what is the smallest of those intercepts? Well, the smallest number here is negative square root, negative square root of two. And you could tackle it the other way. You could take this part right over... Which part? Yeah, this part right over here and you could add those two middle terms, and then factor in a non-grouping way, and I encourage you to do that. But just to see that this makes sense that zeros really are the x-intercepts. I went to Wolfram|Alpha and I graphed this polynomial and this is what I got. So, this is what I got, right over here. If you see a fifth-degree polynomial, say, it'll have as many as five real zeros. But, if it has some imaginary zeros, it won't have five real zeros. Instead, this one has three. And that's because the imaginary zeros, which we'll talk more about in the future, they come in these conjugate pairs. So, if you don't have five real roots, the next possibility is that you're going to have three real roots. And, if you don't have three real roots, the next possibility is you're gonna have one real root. So, that's an interesting thing to think about. And so, here you see, your three real roots. You see your three real roots which correspond to the x-values at which the function is equal to zero, which is where we have our x-intercepts.",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-1
"  All right, so I think we have a pretty decent appreciation of renal anatomy; we know how the kidney is structured, now we just need to take a look at some of the finer details. We started talking about the nephron, which I kinda drew right here, and we said, ""This is the functional unit of filtration ""and collection in the kidney."" So let's start off with the very beginning of the nephron. The first part of the nephron is called the ""glomerulus""; it receives branches that come off the renal artery, you see a branch going that a way; there's a branch going this a way, and just like any artery, it branches off into arterioles, and it's an arteriole that comes up first to meet the glomerulus. So if we look down here, we're going to have something that came off of the renal artery, that's an arteriole, so I'll write, ""arteriole,"" right here, and we actually further specify this: we call this the ""afferent arteriole,"" ""afferent"" meaning, ""going towards."" And so, this is the afferent arteriole, or the arteriole that's going towards the glomerulus. The glomerulus then, is this really loopy structure; there's a lot of spinning that goes on here, then we branch off again, and this gives us the same arteriole, this is the same vessel we just started off with, so we're going this way, and spinning around and coming out, as one single vessel, but we call this part of it, the ""efferent"" arteriole: ""efferent,"" meaning that we have left the glomerulus. And that of course leaves this ball-like structure over here, that's going to be known as the glomerulus. Now the thing about the glomerulus that's really interesting: it's the main site for filtration, where we take blood that came in from the renal artery, and we push out a whole bunch of fluid, that we're then going to take out some ions, and some water, and some waste, and we'll get rid of the waste or the extra ions. The glomerulus is where we take blood and turn it into filtrate, and let the rest of the blood flow on. So this efferent arteriole is gonna turn into a capillary, and then it's gonna go into venules, and then collect back, and come out as the renal vein; we'll talk about that in a later video, when I talk about other parts of the nephron. The glomerulus though, just leaks out fluid, and it needs to be caught somewhere. That fluid that leaks out is caught in a capsule, that's kind of hugging the glomerulus right here. So I'm gonna draw it, like that, and it kinda keeps going this way, and this is gonna continue on, into the rest of our nephron, but this thing right here, it's a capsule, and actually it has a name; it's named after a British scientist, ""Doctor Bowman,"" so we call this, ""Bowman's Capsule."" This is Bowman's Capsule, and this is where we're going to collect the filtrate, or the fluid that comes out of the glomerululs. The inside right here is just open space, so they call it, ""Bowman's Space"" as well, so it's just space that's gonna collect our filtrate. So at this point, you should be asking yourself, ""Why is it that we're gonna have fluid leak out here? ""I mean, there's all this wrapping that goes around, ""so we've got high pressure, but how is this different ""from other arterioles in our body? ""Why is it that we have so much leakage, ""purposefully happening here, ""but it doesn't happen everywhere else in our body?"" So let me answer your question, and why don't we just blow up that part, right here, and open this window so we can take a better look. So the point where the arteriole meets Bowman's Capsule, there's a lot going on. Recall, that when we have a vessel, I'll draw half of it, like that, right there, and it's kind of going this a way, okay, so that's our vessel that's right here. This vessel's got a lot of good stuff, like our red blood cells, our white blood cells, platelets, some really really big proteins, so I'm just gonna draw something really big, right here; that's a giant protein, and it's not gonna leak out into our Bowmans' Capsule. So, this stuff kinda moves along that way, then again, we've got other things like ions, so I'm gonna write, ""Sodium"" right there. We've also got smaller protein sub-units, like amino acids; I'll just write, ""AA,"" and we've also got glucose in here. These are things that can leak out, so how is it they get from the arteriole, into Bowman's Space? So our vessels, our arterioles, just like anything else in our body; they're made up of cells. And the cells that line our vessels over here, I'll just draw a whole bunch of these guys, kinda hanging out, so these guys are called, ""endothelial cells""; each of these is an endothelial cell. So an endothelial cell is a lot like most of our eukaryotic cells: They've got a nucleus, and they've got all their organelles, and stuff like that goin' on; I'm not gonna go into that kinda detail for right now, but just recall that they're eukaryotic cells. Now something that's special about these vessels, is that they're fenestrated. Write that in parenthesis, ""fenestrated,"" and if you don't know what this term means, all it means is that these vessels have a lot of holes; they're very ""holey,"" and so, because of that, the holes allow small things like sodium, and amino acids, and glucose to leak through, so it's got some holes in them, you know, the way that they're sort of connected. So there are holes where these guys can kinda slip through. And actually some of these holes can allow bigger proteins to come through, but these proteins still don't, because there's another added layer, that sits in between these endothelial cells in the in the tuble, so this is sort of another membrane that's right here. I'll just kinda draw it shaded in, like this, and it's not a complete barrier; it's semi-permeable, meaning some things can leak through, but this is another membrane, that we call, the ""Basement Membrane""; this is a basement membrane, and you may have heard about this in other contexts. So the basement membrane right here, helps to make sure that small things pass through: things like sodium can get through these fenestrations, and leak out; our amino acids can do the same; and our glucose can, at times, as well; but these bigger proteins bounce back; they bounce back, because either they can't make it through the fenestrations, or the basement membrane prevents them from leaking into Bowman's Space. And then finally, we've got the tubular cells, tubular cells that make up the interaction point on the end of the Bowman's Capsule. So they sort of look like this; they're pretty long cells, and the funny thing about them is that some of these guys actually hug the vessel; they hug the endothelial cells, like that. And so, they're sort of like these legs; this is sort of a leg-like projection, and so, if you remember a doctor you might see, if you've got problems with your feet is a ""podiatrist,"" and so this type of cell, we call these ""podocytes"" right, ""podo"" meaning ""foot."" Podocytes, and so there are some podocytes, in addition to these tubular cells, there are some that are just tubule cells. And another term for that, is just an ""epithelial cell""; this is an epithelial cell, okay? And so, we go from the endothelial cell, to the epithelial cell, and I think I should also mention that these podocytes are a certain class of epithelial cell, as well, and so, these guys hug around the arteriole; that sort of helps for this connection to stay close.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" -  What I have listed here is several of the derivative rules that we've used in previous videos. If these things look unfamiliar to you I encourage you to maybe to not watch this video because in this video we're going to think about when do we apply these rules? What strategies and can we algebraically convert expressions so that we can use a simpler rule? But this is a quick review, this is of course the power rule right over here, very handy for taking derivatives of X raised to some power. It's also we can use that with the derivative properties of sums of derivatives or differences of derivatives to take derivatives of polynomials. This right over here is the product rule. If I have an expression that I want to take the derivative of and I can think of it as the product of two functions, well then the derivative is going to be the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second. Once again if this looks completely unfamiliar to you or you're a little shaky, go watch the videos, do the practice on the power rule and the product rule, or in this case the quotient rule. And the quotient rule is a little bit more involved and we have practicing videos on that and I always have mixed feelings about it because if you don't remember the quotient rule, you can usually or you can always convert a quotient into a product by expressing this thing at the bottom as F of X times G of X to the negative one. So you could take the derivative with a combination of the products and this fourth rule over here, the chain rule. And if any of this is looking unfamiliar again don't watch this video, this video is for folks who are familiar with each of these derivative rules or derivative techniques and now want to think about well what are strategies for deciding when to apply which. So let's do that. Let's say that I have the expression, let's say I'm interested in taking the derivative of X squared plus X minus two over X minus one. Which of these rules or techniques would you use? Well you might immediately say hey look this looks like a rational expression, I could say this is my F of X right over here, I could say this is my G of X right over here and I could apply the quotient rule, this looks like a quotient of two expressions. And you could do that and if you do all the mathematics correctly, you will get the correct answer. But in this case it's good to just take a little time to realize well can I simplify this algebraically so maybe I can do a little bit less work? And if you look at it that way, you might realize wait what if I factored this numerator I can factor it as X plus two times X minus one. And then I could cancel these two characters out and I can say hey you know what this is going to be the same thing as the derivative with respect to X of X plus two. Derivative with respect to X of X plus two, which is much much much much more straightforward than trying to apply the quotient rule. Here you would just take the derivative with respect to X of X which is just going to be one and the derivative with respect to X of two is just going to be zero and so all of this is going to simplify to one. If we're taking the derivative of that, you're essentially just using the power rule. And so once again just a simple algebraic recognition things become much more simple. Let's do another example. So let's say that you were to see, or someone were to ask you to take the derivative with respect to X of, let me see, so let's say you had X squared plus two X minus five over X. So once again you might be tempted to use the quotient rule, this looks like the quotient of two expressions. But then you might realize there's some algebraic manipulations I could do to make this simpler. You could express this as a product, you could say that this is the same thing as, and I'm just going to focus on what's inside the parentheses or inside the brackets, this is the same thing as X to the negative one times X squared plus 2x minus five and then you might want to apply the product rule. But there's even a better simplification here. You could just divide each of these terms by X or one way to think about it distribute this one over X across all the terms, X to the negative one is the same thing as one over X and if you do that X squared divided by X is going to be X. 2x divided by X is going to be two and then negative five divided by X, well you could write that as negative five over X or negative five X to the negative one. And now I'm taking the derivative of this with respect to X is much easier than using either the quotient or the power rule. This is going to be, let's see the derivative of that is going to be one, derivative of two is going to be zero and here even though you have a negative exponent, it might look a little intimidating, this is just taken using the power rule. So negative one times negative five is positive five X to the, if we take one less than negative one we're going to go the negative two power. So once again making this algebraic recognition simplified things a good bit. Let's do a few more examples of just starting to recognize when we might be able to simplify things to do things a little bit easier. So let's say that someone said hey you take the derivative with respect to X and I'm using X as our variable that we're taking the derivative of with respect to but obviously this works for any variables that we are using. So let's say we're saying square root of X over X squared. Pause this video and think about how would you approach this if you want to take the derivative with respect to X of the square root of X over X squared. Well once again you might say this is a quotient of two expressions, might try to apply the quotient rule, or you might recognize well look this is the same thing, let me just focus on what's inside the brackets, you could view this as X to the negative two times the square root of X and then you might want to use the product rule but you could simplify this even better. You could say this is the same thing as X to the negative two times X to the one half power and now just using our exponent properties, negative two plus one half is negative three halves, so this is the derivative X to the negative three halves power. And so here once again we took something that we thought we might have to use the quotient rule or use the product rule and now this just becomes a straightforward using the power rule. So this is just going to be equal to, so bring the negative three halves out front, negative three halves, X to the negative three halves minus one is negative five halves power. So once again just before you, especially if you're about to apply the quotient rule and sometimes even the product rule, just see is there an algebraic simplification, sometimes a trigonometric simplification that you can make that eases your job that makes things less hairy? As a general tip I can't say this is going to be always true but if you're taking some type of exam and you're going down some really hairy route which the quotient rule will often take you, it's a good sign that hey take a pause before trying to run through all of that algebra to apply the quotient rule and see if you can simplify things. So let's give another example. In this one there's not an obvious way and it really depends on what folks' preferences are, but let's say you want to take the derivative with respect to X of one over 2x to the negative five, sorry, one over 2x minus five I should say. Well here you could immediately apply the quotient rule here the numerator you view that as F of X. You could view this as the same thing as the derivative with respect to X. Instead of 2x minus five, let me do that in the blue color. 2x minus five to the negative one power. In this situation, you would use a combination of the power rule and the chain rule. You would say okay my G of X is 2x minus five and F of G of X is going to be this whole expression. And so if you applied the chain rule, this is going to be the derivative of the outside function, our F of X with respect to the inside function. The derivative of F of G of X with respect to G of X. So it's going to be negative, we'll bring that negative out front, so we're essentially just going to use the power rule here. Negative 2x minus five to the negative two and then we multiply that times the derivative of the inside function. So the inside function's derivative, the derivative of 2x is two, the derivative of negative five is zero so it's going to be times two and of course you can simplify so it's a negative two times all of this business. Let me do one more example here just to hit the point home and once again there isn't a must way, there isn't a way that you have to do this, but just let you appreciate that there's multiple ways to approach these types of derivatives. So let's say someone said take the derivative of 2x plus one squared. Pause the video and think about how you would do that. Well one way to do it is just to apply the chain rule 1just like we just did. 1So you could say alright here's going to be the derivative 1of the outside with respect to the inside. 1So it's going to be two times 2x plus one to the first 1power, taking one less than that times the derivative 1of the inside which is just going to be two and so this 1is going to be equal to four times 2x plus one, 1which is equal to, if we want to distribute the four, 1we could say it's 8x plus four. 1That's a completely legitimate way of doing it. 1Now there are other ways of doing it. 1You could expand out to X plus one squared. 1You could say hey this is the same thing as the derivative 1with respect to X of 2x squared is going to be 4x squared 1and then two times the product of these terms is going 1to be plus 4x plus one. 1And now you would just apply the power rule. 1It's a little bit of extra algebra up front but you can 1just go straightforward with the power rule and you're 1going to get this exact same thing. 1So the whole takeaway here is pause look at your expression. 1See if there's a way to simplify it and it's especially 1a good thing if you can get out of using the quotient rule 1'cause that sometimes is just hard to know or remember 1and even when you do remember it, it can get quite hairy 1quite fast.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-differentiation-2-new
" We're now on problem number 4 from the Normal Distribution chapter from ck12.org's FlexBook on AP Statistics. You can go to their site to download it. It's all for free. So problem number 4, and it's, at least in my mind, pretty good practice. For a normal, or a standard normal distribution, place the following in order from smallest to largest. So let's see, percentage of data below 1, negative 1. OK. Let's draw our standard normal distribution. So a standard normal distribution is one where the mean is-- sorry, I drew the standard deviation-- is one where the mean, mu for mean, is where the mean is equal to 0, and the standard deviation is equal to 1. So let me draw that standard normal distribution. Let's see, so let me draw the axis right like that. Let me see if I can draw a nice-looking bell curve. So there's the bell curve right there. You get the idea. And this is a standard normal distribution, so the mean, or you can kind view the center point right here. It's not skewed. This says the mean is going to be 0 right there, and the standard deviation is 1. So if we go 1 standard deviation to the right, that is going to be 1. If you go 2 standard deviations, it's going to be 2, 3 standard deviations, 3, just like that. 1 standard deviation to the left is going to be minus 1. 2 standard deviations to the left will be minus 2, and so on, and so forth. Minus 3 will be 3 standard deviations to the left because the standard deviation is 1. So let's see if we can answer this question. So what's the percentage of data below 1? Part a, that's this stuff right here. So everything below 1, so it's all of-- well, not just that little center portion. It keeps going. Everything below 1, percentage of data below 1. So this is another situation where we should use the empirical rule. Never hurts to get more practice. Empirical rule, or maybe the better way to remember the empirical rule is just the 68, 95, 99.7 rule. And I call that a better way because it essentially gives you the rule. These are just the numbers that you have to essentially memorize. And if you have a calculator or a normal distribution table, you don't have to do this. But sometimes in class, or people want you to estimate percentages, and so you can impress people if you can do this in your head. So let's see if we can use the empirical rule to answer this question, the area under the bell curve all the way up to 1, or everything to the left of 1. So the empirical rule tells us that this middle area between 1 standard deviation to the left and 1 standard deviation to the right, that right there is 68%. We saw that in the previous video as well. That's what the empirical rule tells us. Now, if that's 68%, we saw in the last video that everything else combined, it all has to add up to 1 or to 100%, that this left-hand tail-- let me draw it a little bit-- this part right here plus this part right here has to add up, when you add it to 68, has to add up to 1 or to 100%. So those two combined are 32%. 32 plus 68 is 100. Now, this is symmetrical. These two things are the exact same. So if they add up to 32, this right here is 16%, and this right here is 16%. Now, the question, they want us to know the area of everything-- let me do it in a new color-- everything less than 1, the percentage of data below 1, so everything to the left of this point. So it's the 68%. It's right there, so it's 68%, which is this middle area within 1 standard deviation, plus this left branch right there. So 68 plus 16%, which is what? That's equal to 84%. So part a is 84%. They're going to want us to put this in order eventually, but it's good to just solve because that's really the hard part. Once we know the numbers, ordering is pretty easy. Part b, the percentage of data below minus 1. So minus 1 is right there. So they really just want us to figure out this area right here, the percentage of data below minus 1. Well, that's going to be 16%. We just figured that out. And you could have already known just without even knowing the empirical, just looking at a normal distribution, that this entire area, that part b is a subset of part a, so it's going to be a smaller number. So if you just have to order things, you could have made that intuition, but it's good to do practice with the empirical rule. Now part c, they want to know, what's the mean? Well, that's the easiest thing. The mean of a standard normal distribution, by definition, is 0. So number c is 0. d, the standard deviation. Well, by definition, the standard deviation for the standard normal distribution is 1. So this is 1 right here. This is easier than I thought it would be. Part e, the percentage of data above 2. So they want the percentage of data above 2. So we know from the 68, 95, 99.7 rule that if we want to know how much data is within 2 standard deviations-- so let me do it in a new color. Let me do it in a more vibrant color, green. If we're looking from this point to this point-- so it's within 2 standard deviations, right, the standard deviation here is 1-- if we're looking within 2 standard deviations, that whole area right there, by the empirical rule, is 95%, within 2 standard deviations. This is 95%. Which tells us that everything else combined-- so if you take this yellow portion right here and this yellow portion right here, so everything beyond 2 standard deviations in either direction-- that has to be the remainder. So you know everything in the middle was 95 within 2 standard deviations. So that has to be 5%, if you add that tail and that tail together, everything to the left and right of 2 standard deviations. Well, I've made the argument before, everything is symmetrical. This and this are equal. So this right here is 2 and 1/2%, and this right here is also 2 and 1/2%. So they're asking us the percentage of data above 2, that's this tail, just this tail right here, the percentage of data more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean. So that's 2 and 1/2%. Let me do it in a darker color-- 2 and 1/2%. Now, they're asking us, let's see, place the following in order from smallest to largest. So there's a little bit of ambiguity here. Because if they're saying the percentage of data below 1, do they want us to say, well, it's 84%. So should we consider the answer to part a, 84? Or should we consider-- if they said the fraction of data below 1, I would say 0.84. So it depends on how they want to interpret it. Same way here. The percentage of data below minus 1, I could say the answer is 16. 16 is the percentage below minus 1. But the actual number, if I said the fraction of data below minus 1, I would say 0.16. So this actually would be very different in how we order it. Similarly, if someone me asked me the percent, I'd say, oh, that's 2.5. But the actual number is 0.025. That's the actual fraction or the actual decimal. So I mean, this is just ordering numbers, so I shouldn't fixate on this too much. But let's just say that they're going with the decimal. So if we wanted to do it that way, they want to do it from smallest to largest, the smallest number we have here is c, right? That's 0. And then the next smallest is e, which is 0.025. Then the next smallest is b, which is 0.16. And then the next one after that is a, which is 0.84. And then the largest would be the standard deviation, d. So the answer is c, e, b, a , d. And obviously, the order would be different if the answer to this, instead of saying it's 0.84, if you said it was 84 because it's asking for the percentage. So a little bit of ambiguity. If we had a question like this on the exam, I would clarify that with the teacher. But hopefully you found this useful.",math_statistics-probability_modeling-distributions-of-data
" Here's some of the guidelines for drawing dot structures. So let's say we wanted to draw the dot structure for this molecule, so silicon tetrafluoride. The first thing we would need to do is to find the total number of valence electrons. And we would account for these valence electrons in our dot structure. So to find the valence electrons, we need to look at it periodic table. So here I have a modified version of the periodic table. And you see what I've done is, I've kind of cut out the d-block here, so we can focus in on the elements that we're going to be drawing in our dot structures. It also makes it easier to see how the group numbers correspond to the number of valence electrons. For example, if we look at elements in the first group, like hydrogen, lithium, or sodium, the first group all have one valence electron. So the group number corresponds to how many valence electrons something has. So hydrogen has one valence electron. If we think about the periods, hydrogen is in the first period, or the first energy level. So periods are going horizontally across your periodic table. Hydrogen is in group one, it has one valence electron. And if I go over here to helium, this would be two valence electrons for helium. And so in the first energy level, you can fit a maximum of two electrons. And so this is going to important when we're drawing our dot structures. Because when we're drawing hydrogen, we're always going to surround it by two electrons, or a single covalent bond. When you take the second period on the periodic table, so here we are on the second period, lithium has one valence electron, beryllium has two, boron has three, carbon has four, nitrogen has five, oxygen has six, fluorine seven, and neon eight. And so you have more orbitals in a second energy level. And so because of that, you can fit more electrons. So maximum of eight electrons in the second energy level. And this is where the idea of the octet rule comes in. So for elements like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, understanding the octet rule is going to help you when you're drawing dot structures. Now it is possible for some of the elements of the second period to not have eight electrons. It's possible for them to have less than eight electrons. So things like boron will sometimes do that. But it is not possible for elements to have more than eight electrons. Always check your dot structures, and make sure that if you have an element in the second period, you do not exceed eight electrons. Once you get to the third period, you have even more orbitals available to you now. So in the first energy level, you have only one s orbital. In the second energy level you have s and p orbitals, and in the third energy level you have s, p, and d orbitals. So you can fit more than eight electrons. And so therefore it's possible to exceed the octet rule for elements in the third period and beyond. And we will see a few examples of that in this video, and some of the ones to come here. So getting back to our molecule, silicon tetrafluoride, if I wanted to find out how many total valence electrons are in this molecule, I need to find these elements on my periodic table. So I go over here and I find silicon, and I see it's in group four. So therefore one atom of silicon has four valence electrons. Fluorine is over here in a group of seven, and so therefore each atom of fluorine will have seven valence electrons. And I have four of them. So 7 times 4 gives me 28 valence electrons for my fluorine. The total number valence electrons for my molecule will be 28 plus 4. So I have to account for 32 valence electrons when I draw this dot structure. So let's go ahead and move on to the next step. Let's go back up here and look at our guidelines. So we figured out how many valence electrons we need to account for for our dot structure. We don't have any kind of charges, so we don't need to worry about the rest of step one here. We move on to step two, where we decide on the central atom of our dot structure. And the way to do this is to pick the least electronegative element that we have here, and then draw the bonds. And so for our example, we're working with silicon and fluorine. And so we can go ahead and find those again on our periodic table. Here's fluorine. Fluorine is the most electronegative element, and so therefore, for silicon tetrafluoride, we're going to put the silicon atom at the center of our dot structure, since it is the least electronegative of those two. So I'm going to start with silicon here. And I know that silicon has four bonds to fluorine atoms. I'm going to go ahead and put in some fluorines right here. So here's some fluorines like that. So I just drew four covalent bonds, and we know that each covalent bond represents two valence electrons, right? So here's two valence electrons, here's two, so that's a total of four, six, and eight. So we've represented eight valence electrons so far in our dot structure. So we originally had to represent 32. So I'm going to go ahead and subtract 8 from 32. So 32 minus 8 gives me 24. So now I only have to account for 24 valence electrons. Let's go back up and look at our steps again. So let's find out where we are. So we've decided the central atom, and we've drawn the bonds, and we just subtracted the electrons that we used to draw those bonds from the total that we got in step one. So we're on to step three, where we assign the leftover electrons to the terminal atoms. So in this case, the terminal atoms would be the fluorines. So let's go back down here and look at our dot structure. So fluorine would be the terminal atoms, and we're going to assign electrons to those fluorines. But how many do we need to assign? Well, going back to our periodic table over here, so fluorine is in the second period. So pretty good bet it's going to follow the octet rule here. So we need to surround each fluorine atom with eight electrons. Each fluorine already has two electrons around it, so I'm going to go ahead and put six more around each fluorine, like that. So each fluorine get six more valence electrons. And since I'm assigning six valence electrons to four fluorines, 6 times 4 gives me 24. And so therefore we've now accounted for all of the valence electrons. And so this should be the should be the final dot structure here. And so we don't even need to go on to step four for this molecule. This is a very simple molecule to draw. Let's go ahead and look at another example. So now we have CH2O, which is the dot structure for, which is the molecular formula, I should say, for formaldehyde. And so if we're following our guidelines here, the first thing we need to do is find out the valence electrons. So we need to look and find carbon, hydrogen, oxygen on our periodic table. So let's go back up here, and let's find those elements here. So here's carbon. Carbon's in group four, so therefore carbon will have four valence electrons. Here's hydrogen, in group one, so one valence electron. And oxygen is in group six, so six valence electrons for oxygen. So let's go back down and let's calculate the total number of valence electrons that we need to represent in our dot structure. We have one atom of carbon, so that's four valence electrons. Each hydrogen is one valence electron, but we have two of them, so 1 times 2. And each oxygen is six, and we have one of them, so six. So 6 plus 4 plus 2 is 12 valence electrons. So we need to represent 12 valence electrons in our dot structure. All right. Let's go back up to our guidelines and see where we are now. So we've already figured out the total number of valence electrons. Once again, we don't have any charges, so we don't need to worry about the rest of step one. Step two is to assign the central atom, which is the least electronegative. And remember you're going to ignore hydrogen for this example. So if we ignore hydrogen, the central atom is either going to be carbon or oxygen. And let's look at our periodic table to figure out the relative values for those. Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. Here we go. Here's oxygen, right next to fluorine. And here's carbon, over here. So remember your trends for electronegativity. Oxygen is more electronegative, therefore carbon is going to be at the center of our dot structure. So we're going to go ahead and put carbon in the center. So go ahead and draw carbon. And we know that the carbon's going to be bonded to two hydrogens. And we know that the carbon is going to be bonded to an oxygen here. So let's see how many valence electrons we've accounted for so far. Two, four, and six. So we needed 12. We just used up 6. So right now we have six valence electrons leftover. OK, so let's go back up and look at the next step here. So we are to step three. Assign the left over electrons to the terminal atoms here. All right, so the terminal atoms. Well, in this case, our terminal atoms would be hydrogen and oxygen. But we're not going to assign any electrons to hydrogen, because each hydrogen is now surrounded by two electrons. And so therefore we're going to assign those leftover electrons to the oxygen here. And oxygen's going to follow the octet rule. So it already has two around it, so it needs six more. So 2, 4, and then 6. And so that actually takes care of all of our valence electrons, right? So now we have accounted for all 12 of them. However we're not done with our dot structure here. So carbon actually follows the octet rule almost all of the time. And let's go back up here and let's look at step four here. So for step four, if the central atom doesn't have an octet, and it usually does have an octet, you can give it an octet by creating multiple bonds. So let's look at what we have so far for our dot structure, and let's see if we can create multiple bonds somehow. So if I took one of these electron pairs here, and I moved them into here, let's see what that would give us for a dot structure. Now I'd have carbon with a double bond to oxygen. And this oxygen would have two lone pairs of electrons. And then these hydrogens right down here. And so this would be the correct dot structure for formaldehyde. You have an octet of electrons around carbon. You have an octet of electrons around oxygen. And hydrogen has two electrons around it, which it is happy with. 1So this is the correct dot structure. 1And let me just talk about some terminology really fast here. 1So these electrons in here, so this 1would be a double bond between the carbon and the oxygen, 1these electrons you would call bonding electrons. 1Because, obviously, they're involved in bonding. 1And then these electrons out here 1would be non-bonding electrons, or lone pairs of electrons. 1So that's just terminology that you'll 1hear people use when you're talking about dot structures. 1All right. 1And then let me just go ahead and highlight the fact 1that carbon has an octet of electrons here. 1So this would be two, four, six, and eight electrons surrounding 1our carbon. 1All right. 1Let's do one more example here. 1Let's look at, this time an ion. 1So this would be the xenon pentafluoride cation here. 1So we need to look and find xenon and fluorine 1on our periodic table. 1So we can figure out how many valence 1electrons we're dealing with here. 1So let's find xenon first. 1So here is xenon. 1It is in group eight, so eight valence electrons for xenon. 1And then we've seen fluorine of course in group seven. 1So let's go back down and figure out 1how many valence electrons we need to account for here. 1So we have one xenon, and that's eight valence electrons. 1Each fluorine is seven, and we have five of them. 1So 7 times 5 is 35. 1So we have 35 plus 8 gives us 43. 1Now this is actually not the total number of electrons 1that we're going to account for, because this is an ion. 1This is a plus 1, a positive charge. 1Which means that we lost an electron. 1Remember, and electron is negatively charged, 1so if you lose a negative charge, 1you have a positive charge left over. 1And so we're going to take away an electron. 1So instead of 43, we are now going 1to account for 42 in our dot structure. 1Let's go back up to our guidelines, 1and I'll show you where I have that 1written down right up here. 1So find the total number of valence electrons, and then, 1in this case we had a positive charge in or ion. 1So we subtracted an electron. 1And then, again, step two, find the central atom, 1least electronegative. 1OK. 1So we know that fluorine is the most electronegative, 1so that means we're going to put xenon in the center. 1So we'll go ahead, and let's get some room right down here, 1and we'll go ahead and put xenon in the center, like that. 1On a two five fluorine, so we can go ahead and put 1in these bonds around here, like that. 1And how many valence electrons have we accounted for so far? 1Well, let's see. 1That would be two, four, six, eight, and ten. 1So we had to represent 42, and we just represented ten. 1So now we have 32 left over that we need to represent. 1And notice, xenon is already violating the octet rule. 1It's exceeding the octet rule. 1And it's OK. 1It can expand its outer shell, because xenon 1is past the third period on the periodic table, 1obviously, like what we talked about earlier. 1So we can go ahead and go to the next step now. 1We're going to assign the leftover electrons 1to the terminal atoms. 1And our terminal atoms are of course 1the fluorines, which we know are going to follow the octet rule. 1And so, once again, each fluorine 1has two electrons around it. 1So that means I'm going to give each 1of the other fluorines six more. 1So I'm going to go ahead and put six more valence electrons 1on each of my fluorines. 1And so when I'm thinking about how many valence electrons 1I have represented now, right, so I 1have six more on five fluorines. 1So 6 times 5 is 30. 1So I've represented 30 more electrons. 1And so that means I have two left over. 1So two valence electrons leftover. 1We haven't had this situation before. 1Let's go back up to the guidelines 1to refresh our memory, what we do, 1when we have leftover electrons after step three. 1So we get to step four here. 1So, if necessary, in this case it is, 1we're going to assign any leftover electrons back 1to the central atom this time. 1And if the central atom has an octet 1or exceeds an octet, which is what we have in this example, 1you are usually done. 1And we're not going to worry about formal charges 1in this video, I'll talk about them in the next video. 1So we're going to take those two electrons 1and assign them into our xenon. 1So let's go back down here, and assign 1those two extra electrons to the xenon. 1And so we would draw it like that. 1And so now we are done, we've represented all 42 1of the valence electrons that we were supposed to. 1So you can count all those up if you want to. 1Now most people will represent this dot structure 1by putting brackets here. 1And putting a positive charge outside of it. 1So there's your xenon pentafluoride cation. 1So we're going to a lot more examples 1for drawing dot structures in the next several videos, 1and see how drawing dot structures allows 1you to predict the shapes of different molecules.",science_ap-chemistry_chemical-bonds-ap
" -  Over here, we have the graph of the function Y is equal to E to the X. Actually, let me make that clear. That right over there is Y is equal to E to the X. This is, of course, our X axis. This is our Y axis. And so, this blue area right over here, this blue area, we can denote that as the definite integral from zero to one of E to the X, DX and let's say we know in the future, we'll learn how to come up with this number but let's just say we know that that area is equal to E minus one. Given that, I have these other three definite integrals and what I encourage you to do is try to pause this video and try to evaluate what this three other definite integrals are using only this information and what we already know about definite integral properties. I am assuming that you have given a go at it. You might first say, okay, let's see E to the X plus two. You might be tempted to decompose this into definite integral of E to the X, DX plus the definite integral from one to-- So that you could decompose this from one to one at E to X, DX plus one to one, plus the definite integral from one to one of two DX but you have to remember if you're taking the definite integral where your bounds are the same. This is the definite integral from one to one. This is going to be zero. This is going to be equal to zero. Once again, you can imagine that you're trying to find the area of something that has no width. You're not moving at all. You have no width along the X axis here. That was pretty straightforward. From one to one, your area is going to be zero. Now, let's think through this one over here. Here my bounds are different. They are the same as these bounds right over here. I guess that gives me a pretty good clue that maybe if I can break this up a little bit, especially if one of these is in the form of E to the X, I might be able to evaluate this definite integral. Let's do that. The first thing I could do is I could break this up as the definite integral from zero to one of 3DX and then I could say Plus the definite integral from zero to one of negative E to the X, DX and then I can take the negative. That negative is really just a negative one. We saw that you could take that scaling factor out of the integral so let's do that. This is the same thing as the integral from zero to one. 3DX minus the integral from zero to one, E to the X, DX. Well, lucky for us, we already know what, let me do this in that same color. We already know what this, I have trouble changing colors. We already know what this right over here is. That's going to be equal to E minus one. If you subtract an E minus one, you're going to get, actually, let me just write it out so we don�t get confused. We're going to subtract an E minus one, what is this going to be equal to? The definite integral from zero to one of 3DX. We just have to graph that to imagine it. We're going from zero to one and the function is that one, two, three. I'm not doing it at the same scale. The function looks like that. This right over here is just this area. Under the function F of X is equal to three. from zero to one So, what's this area? Well, this is just our base. Our width is one. Our height is three. This is just going to evaluate to three. That's just going to be equal to three and so, this is going to be equal to three and you're going to have minus E, just distributing the negative side and then plus one. And then of course, three plus one is going to be equal to four. This is going to be equal to four minus four, minus E and we're done. We're able to solve or I guess we say, evaluate or find the value of this definite integral using only integration properties in the value of this definite integral. Now, what about this one over here? This one is interesting way. I have different bounds here. Definitely go from two to three. Having E to X minus two. And when you see something like this, especially, if you're trying to evaluate this only with integration properties, the big thing that may or may not jump out of you is that E to the X minus two is shifted version of E to the X. It's shifted by two to the right. Let me draw that. Instead of this point being there, this point is going to be there and so, the curve is going to look something like let me draw my best attempt. My best attempt to do it. It's going to be like there. It's going to be like there. It's going to look something. I'm trying my best to just shift it over. So each of these, this is going to be shifted to right over here. There you go. E to the X minus two. We're going from two to three and so, what are the bounds now? The bounds are from two to three. We're going from this point right over here to three, which is going to be over here. Just going to be over here. Take this point, you shift one and two. You're going to get right over here and what do we just do? We're thinking about this area right over here. We shifted the curve over to the right by two. This is the curve of E to the X minus two and we shifted the interval event that we're trying to find the area under. We shifted that by two. This is going to have the exact same area. I just shifted everything to the right by two. This area is also going to be E minus one. In my mind, this one's a little bit tricky. You just have to realize that this is just a shifted version of that and that we also shifted the two bounds to the right and we already saw that in one of the integration property videos.",math_old-integral-calculus_definite-integrals-intro-ic
" Let's do a few more problems that bring together the concepts that we learned in the last two videos. So let's say we have the inequality 4x plus 3 is less than negative 1. So let's find all of the x's that satisfy this. So the first thing I'd like to do is get rid of this 3. So let's subtract 3 from both sides of this equation. So the left-hand side is just going to end up being 4x. These 3's cancel out. That just ends up with a zero. No reason to change the inequality just yet. We're just adding and subtracting from both sides, in this case, subtracting. That doesn't change the inequality as long as we're subtracting the same value. We have negative 1 minus 3. That is negative 4. Negative 1 minus 3 is negative 4. And then we'll want to-- let's see, we can divide both sides of this equation by 4. Once again, when you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a positive number, it doesn't change the inequality. So the left-hand side is just x. x is less than negative 4 divided by 4 is negative 1. x is less than negative 1. Or we could write this in interval notation. All of the x's from negative infinity to negative 1, but not including negative 1, so we put a parenthesis right there. Let's do a slightly harder one. Let's say we have 5x is greater than 8x plus 27. So let's get all our x's on the left-hand side, and the best way to do that is subtract 8x from both sides. So you subtract 8x from both sides. The left-hand side becomes 5x minus 8x. That's negative 3x. We still have a greater than sign. We're just adding or subtracting the same quantities on both sides. These 8x's cancel out and you're just left with a 27. So you have negative 3x is greater than 27. Now, to just turn this into an x, we want to divide both sides by negative 3. But remember, when you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you swap the inequality. So if we divide both sides of this by negative 3, we have to swap this inequality. It will go from being a greater than sign to a less than sign. And just as a bit of a way that I remember greater than is that the left-hand side just looks bigger. This is greater than. If you just imagine this height, that height is greater than that height right there, which is just a point. I don't know if that confuses you or not. This is less than. This little point is less than the distance of that big opening. That's how I remember it. But anyway, 3x over negative 3. So now that we divided both sides by a negative number, by negative 3, we swapped the inequality from greater than to less than. And the left-hand side, the negative 3's cancel out. You get x is less than 27 over negative 3, which is negative 9. Or in interval notation, it would be everything from negative infinity to negative 9, not including negative 9. If you wanted to do it as a number line, it would look like this. This would be negative 9, maybe this would be negative 8, maybe this would be negative 10. You would start at negative 9, not included, because we don't have an equal sign here, and you go everything less than that, all the way down, as we see, to negative infinity. Let's do a nice, hairy problem. So let's say we have 8x minus 5 times 4x plus 1 is greater than or equal to negative 1 plus 2 times 4x minus 3. Now, this might seem very daunting, but if we just simplify it step by step, you'll see it's no harder than any of the other problems we've tackled. So let's just simplify this. You get 8x minus-- let's distribute this negative 5. So let me say 8x, and then distribute the negative 5. Negative 5 times 4x is negative 20x. Negative 5-- when I say negative 5, I'm talking about this whole thing. Negative 5 times 1 is negative 5, and then that's going to be greater than or equal to negative 1 plus 2 times 4x is 8x. 2 times negative 3 is negative 6. And now we can merge these two terms. 8x minus 20x is negative 12x minus 5 is greater than or equal to-- we can merge these constant terms. Negative 1 minus 6, that's negative 7, and then we have this plus 8x left over. Now, I like to get all my x terms on the left-hand side, so let's subtract 8x from both sides of this equation. I'm subtracting 8x. This left-hand side, negative 12 minus 8, that's negative 20. Negative 20x minus 5. Once again, no reason to change the inequality just yet. All we're doing is simplifying the sides, or adding and subtracting from them. The right-hand side becomes-- this thing cancels out, 8x minus 8x, that's 0. So you're just left with a negative 7. And now I want to get rid of this negative 5. So let's add 5 to both sides of this equation. The left-hand side, you're just left with a negative 20x. These 5's cancel out. No reason to change the inequality just yet. Negative 7 plus 5, that's negative 2. Now, we're at an interesting point. We have negative 20x is greater than or equal to negative 2. If this was an equation, or really any type of an inequality, we want to divide both sides by negative 20. But we have to remember, when you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, you have to swap the inequality. So let's remember that. So if we divide this side by negative 20 and we divide this side by negative 20, all I did is took both of these sides divided by negative 20, we have to swap the inequality. The greater than or equal to has to become a less than or equal sign. And, of course, these cancel out, and you get x is less than or equal to-- the negatives cancel out-- 2/20 is 1/10. If we were writing it in interval notation, the upper bound would be 1/10. Notice, we're including it, because we have an equal sign, less than or equal, so we're including 1/10, and we're going to go all the way down to negative infinity, everything less than or equal to 1/10. This is just another way of writing that. And just for fun, let's draw the number line. Let's draw the number line right here. This is maybe 0, that is 1. 1/10 might be over here. Everything less than or equal to 1/10. So we're going to include the 1/10 and everything less than that is included in the solution set. And you could try out any value less than 1/10 and verify that it will satisfy this inequality.",math_algebra_solve-equations-inequalities
" -  A nutritionist wants to estimate the average caloric content of the burritos at a popular restaurant. They obtain a random sample of 14 burritos and measure their caloric content. Their sample data are roughly symmetric with a mean of 700 calories and a standard deviation of 50 calories. Based on this sample, which of the following is a 95% confidence interval for the mean caloric content of these burritos? So, pause this video and see if you can figure it out. All right, what's going on here? So, there's a population of burritos here. There is a mean caloric content that the nutritionist wants to figure out but doesn't know the true population parameter here, the population mean and so, the take a sample of 14 burritos and they calculate some sample statistics. They calculate the sample mean which is 700, they also calculate the sample standard deviation which is equal to 50 and they want to use this data to construct a 95% confidence interval and so, our confidence interval is going to take the form and we've seen this before, our sample mean plus or minus our critical value times the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of N. The reason why we're using a T statistic is because we don't know the actual standard deviation for the population. If we knew the standard deviation for the population, we would use that instead of our sample standard deviation and if we use that, if we use sigma which is a population parameter then we could use a Z statistic right over here, we would use a Z distribution but since we're using this sample standard deviation, that's why we're using a T statistic but now let's do that. So, what is this going to be? So, our sample mean is 700, they tell us that, so it's going to be 700 plus or minus, so what would be our critical value for a 95% confidence interval? Well, we will just get out our T table and with the T table, remember, you have to care about degrees of freedom and if our sample size is 14, then that means you take 14 minus one, so degrees of freedom is N minus one, so that's gonna be 14 minus one is equal to 13. So, we have 13 degrees of freedom that we have to keep in mind when we look at our T table, so let's look at our T table, so 95% confidence interval and 13 degrees of freedom, so degrees of freedom right over here, so we have 13 degrees of freedom, so that is this row right over here and if we want a 95% confidence level, then that means our tail probability, remember, if our distribution, let me see, I'll draw it really small, a little small distribution right over here, so if you want 95% of the area in the middle, that means you have five percent not shaded in and that's evenly divided on each side, so that means you have two and a half percent at the tails, two and a half percent, so what you want to look for is the tail probability of two and a half percent. So, that is this right over here, .025, that two and a half percent and so, there you go, that is our critical value, 2.160. So, this part right over here, so this is going to be two, let me do that in a darker color, this is going to be 2.160 times what's our sample standard deviation? It's 50 over the square root of N, square root of 14, so all of our choices have the 700 there, so we just need to figure out what our margin of error, this part of it and we could use a calculator for that. Okay, 2.16, ic an write a zero there, it doesn't really matter, times 50 divided by the square root of 14, we get a little bit of a drum roll here I think, 28.86. So, this part right over here is approximately 28.86. That's our margin of error and we see out of all of these choices here if we round to the nearest 10th that would be 28.9, so this is approximately 28.9 which is this choice right over here. This was an awfully close one. I guess they're trying to make sure that we're looking at enough digits. So, there we have it. We have established our 95% confidence interval. Now, one thing that we should keep in mind is is this a valid confidence interval? Did we meet our conditions for a valid confidence interval? And here we have to think well, did we take a random sample and they tell us that they obtained a random sample of 14 burritos, so we check that one. Is the sampling distribution roughly normal? Well, if you take over 30 samples then it would be but here we only took 14 but they do tell us that the sample data is roughly symmetric and so, if it's roughly symmetric and it has no significant outliers, then this is reasonable that you can assume that it is roughly normal and then the last condition is the independence condition and here if we aren't sampling with replacement and it doesn't look like we are, if we're not sampling with replacement, this has to be less than 10% of the population of burritos and we're assuming that there's going to be more than 140 burritos that this popular restaurant makes. So, I think we can meet the independence condition as well, so assuming that you feel good about constructing a confidence interval, this is the one that you would actually construct.",math_ap-statistics_estimating-confidence-ap
" -  Let's say this is you, and let's say it's a nice day outside. We've got a sun shining. Let's say it's about 70 degrees outside. And let's say you've been doing a bunch of exercise. One thing that's gonna happen when you do exercise is your body is gonna produce a lot of heat. And the reason for that is you have muscles, like this quadriceps in your leg and like your heart that are gonna be very active when you're doing exercise. And all the reactions that make them active end up releasing heat. And so a problem that your body might face in this situation is how does it maintain its core body temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit? Now, one of the ways that your body can get rid of this excess heat produced by your muscles is to sweat. But there's another way that it gets rid of heat that I'd like to talk about here. And that way also involves the skin. And so to find out more about it, let's look at a zoomed in picture if a little piece of your skin. So here we're gonna draw your skin in this zoomed in frame here. So here is the surface of your skin, which we'll draw in pink. The skin is pink. And below your skin a little bit deeper, you're gonna have some blood vessels. Let's say this is maybe an arteriole. Let's call it arteriole. And this arteriole will be supplying your skin with blood and with oxygen via the blood. The way it's gonna do this is to send off little capillary beds into the skin, which I'll try to draw here. Here are our little capillary beds. And these capillary beds, of course, consist of very fine blood vessels with high surface area that allow exchange of oxygen between the blood and the tissue. But what you have to realize about the skin for our purposes is that it kind of acts as insulation. And the reason for this is that oftentimes it's not a nice day out. And oftentimes you're not doing exercise. So when it's a cold day out and you're maybe just sitting outside, you don't want to lose too much heat. And so in those cases it's great to have this insulation that keeps the heat from down below and from this arteriole, for instance, that keeps that heat from diffusing out too quickly. So it's really just like your house, which during winter you want to have insulation to prevent loss of heat. But these little capillaries that go to the surface of the skin, as you can tell, they kind of bypass all this insulation, and they go right to the surface. And so the heat from the blood going to these capillaries will have a much easier time of getting out. And this analogy to the house is that these little capillaries are like little windows that allow heat out past the insulation in the walls of your house. So one thing you're gonna do when you're trying to get rid of heat, so now we're no longer talking about winter, is, well, what would you do in your house, if it were really hot inside the house and you had these windows that were just kind of, you know, not open too wide, what you would do if you were feeling really hot in your house is you'd open up those windows wider. So that is exactly what your body is going to do when your body is overheating. So here we've got our skin again. And here we've got our arteriole running through the deeper part of the skin. What your body's gonna do is it's gonna open up that window wider. And so it's going to dilate these capillaries over here. It's gonna make them much wider than they were. And this is known as vasodilation. Vasodilation. It'll vasodilate those capillaries because what's gonna happen when these capillaries are vasodilated? Do you think that more or less blood is going to be passing through these capillaries in this situation or in this one? And obviously more is going to pass the capillaries in this situation. So here I'm just drawing in the insulation of our skin again. And now in this case we have a lot more blood going up into these capillaries and therefore, a lot more loss of heat to these surroundings. And so this is what happens when it's hot out and when your body wants to get rid of heat so that it can maintain its nice core temperature of 98.6. And by the way, something we should ask is what's so special about this 98.6? Why do we want that temperature? And the answer is that your body has, as you know, tons of chemical reactions occurring all of the time. And if you've taken some chemistry, you might have learned that temperature affects the way that reactions are carried out, how fast they're carried out, where the equilibrium is, et cetera. And that might sound, you know, fancy or confusing if you don't know much chemistry. But the point is that all the machinery and all the chemistry of your body works optimally at this temperature. And that's why you want to maintain it. Now, this is what happens when it's hot out. And when it's cold out, what do you think is gonna happen? Well, when it's cold out, you're gonna wanna close the windows. You're gonna wanna close these windows that allow heat out. So you're gonna do the reverse. You're going to make your capillaries as small as possible. And so as a result you're gonna have less heat at the surface of your skin. And that's why if it's a cold day outside and you walk around, when you feel your hands, they feel extremely cold. And that's because your body has made all the capillaries in your skin as thin as possible so that you lose very little heat. And because they're thin, this whole surface area of your skin becomes very cold. Now, as a kind of review, we can also ask the question, maybe this has been bothering you for the whole video so far, but how does your body regulate the size of these vessels? And the answer is that all these blood vessels have little bits of smooth muscle around them, which I'll just draw in orange, little smooth muscle cells around them. And these smooth muscle cells, when they contract, when they squeeze, they make the vessels smaller. And when they relax, they allow the vessels to be bigger. And the way that your body tells these smooth muscle cells to squeeze or not to squeeze is just through nerves. So I'm gonna draw a nerve in purple. And it might be kind of hard to see, but I think you get the point. Your body literally sends impulses through these nerves that tell these smooth muscle cells whether they should be contracting or whether they should be relaxing.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" -  Okay, ladies. I'm gonna ask you to recall what's probably a really painful memory. And guys, use your best imagination with this one. You know when you're wearing fake nails? They're glued on really well to your actual nail. And when it comes time to remove them, you're supposed to soak them in some solution that dissolves the glue. But when you're super impatient, sometimes you rip the nail off. And sometimes, your actual nail very tragically comes off with the fake nail. And what's left is a nail bed that's bleeding profusely because the nail bed is a really vascular place, so it has lots of blood vessels running through it. So with that picture sort of in the back of your head, let's talk about the placenta. You have the uterus before there's any embryo, and the wall of the uterus is made up of three layers. On the inside, there's the endometrium, the endometrium, all the way on the inside. And then, the myometrium, that's myo, ""myo"" meaning muscle, because this layer is composed mostly of smooth muscle, myometrium, or the muscular layer in the middle. And that leaves the perimetrium, peri, ""peri"" for periphery, on the periphery of the uterus. Perimetrium, all the way on the outside of the wall. And it's the endometrium that's all the way on the inside that changes, that actually changes to prepare for the implantation of the embryo. And that process of change that the endometrium undergoes is called decidualization. It's a process where blood vessels grow profusely and glands in the endometrium become filled with nutrients, like glycogen. And at the end of this process, at the end of the decidualization, the endometrium is called the decidua. So it goes from being called the endometrium to being called the decidua. Now, looking at the embryo side of things, the outside of the embryo has these cells. The cells are called trophoblasts. Trophoblasts, that's what I'm putting in green over here, those cells called trophoblasts. And these trophblasts actually interact with the decidua. They're actually responsible for the embryo implanting into, or burrowing into, the decidua, to eventually form the placenta. Now, the reason why I'm going into such a detail about this process, about how the trophoblasts dig into the decidua, which, by the way, the part of the decidua that the trophoblasts interact with is called the decidua basalis. That's its specific name. It's called the decidua basalis. The reason why I'm going into detail about this is because of a set of disorders called placenta accreta, increta, and percreta. I know it sounds like the name of Cinderella's evil stepsisters. So in these disorders, the placenta is too firmly attached to the uterus. So instead of the placenta attaching to the decidua basalis, or attaching just to the decidua basalis, it attaches too deeply to the myometrium. And that's usually because a decidua basalis is defective, it's not thick enough. And a trophoblast needs more to grab onto. So they have to dig deeper into the myometrium. And, before I go into what causes defective decidua, let's lease apart the three evil stepsisters. So placenta accreta is when the placenta attaches to the myometrium. So it kind of attaches through the decidua basalis and attaches onto the myometrium. And that's called placenta accreta. Accreta. Right? Now, placenta increta is when the placenta actually penetrates into the myometrium. So it goes all the way through and really digs deeply into the myometrium. And that's called placenta increta. And finally, placenta percreta is when the placenta digs all the way through the myometrium and the perimetrium and sometimes will even invade into the adjacent bladder wall. And going all the way through those layers is called placenta percreta. All right. So why does this happen? How do you get a defective decidua basalis? A lot of times, it's the result of some prior surgery in the uterus. So, for example, a history of a C-section, a history of a uterine curretage, a uterine curretage, which is a type of procedure in which the lining of the uterus is scraped away, for a variety of different reasons, or a myomectomy, a myomectomy, which is another type of procedure that's used for the removal of fibroids in the uterus. So any one of these procedures can lead to a thin or scarred endometrium that doesn't form a juicy, healthy decidua. Another thing that can sometimes happen is that the placenta implants in a lower segment of the uterus, rather than at the top, like it's supposed to, which is a condition that's called placenta, it's called placenta previa. And the problem is that the lower parts of the uterus generally have thinner walls and they don't form as thick of a decidua. So these are a few of the things that can lead to a defective, or a thin and inadequate, decidua. And these risk factors are pretty significant, so much so that if a woman has has had three or more C-sections in the past and she has a placenta previa, she has a 50% chance, or one in two chance, of having a placenta accreta. So that's a type of situation in which you would probably be on the lookout for a placenta accreta. So you might wanna do some imaging on the uterus, such as an ultrasound or an MRI, because that becomes important in these cases. Now, I also wanna mention that there's some thought that sometimes, you can just have trophoblasts that are too aggressive in their implantation or in their digging. And that can contribute to the formation of this disease. Okay. So a lot of times, the way that the placenta accreta is discovered is at the time of delivery, when it's found that the placenta is really hard to remove. And when the practitioner sort of inserts their hand to manually extract the placenta, they find that it's really firmly attached to the uterus. Or someone might pull too hardly on the umbilical cord trying to pull the placenta out, and that rips apart the placenta from the uterus and leads to a lot of bleeding, kind of like when you rip away a fake nail, like we were talking about earlier. And really, because of that, because of the risk of bleeding, the best way to manage this disorder is with a hysterectomy, or a removal of the uterus right after the baby is delivered. And I know that sounds a bit dramatic. You might say, ""Well, why can't we just ""remove the placenta carefully, bit by bit? ""Or leave it in there to come out on its own?"" And the answer is that trying to remove it even very carefully puts the mom at risk for hemorrhage and even death. And leaving the placenta intact places a significant risk for infection. So really, the only option is hysterectomy. Only very, very rarely, in a very young woman who expresses a very strong desire to have children in the future, perhaps then an approach to conserve the uterus can be undertaken. If only there were a glue dissolver of sorts that could allow the placenta to gently peel away from the uterus, then perhaps in the future, we may have a way to avoid hysterectomies. But unfortunately not for now. So all in all, those are some details about placenta accreta, increta and percreta.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" -  So we have the graph of y equal f of x right over here, and what we want to do is figure out the limit of f of x as x approaches negative four. So what does that mean? Well, a limit is saying, ""What does my function approach ""as the input of that function approaches, ""in this case, negative four? ""As the input approaches a value?"" And as we see in this example, the function doesn't necessarily have to be even defined at that value. We can see f of negative four, you go to x equals negative four, and you see that f of negative four is undefined. So this is not defined, but as we'll see even though the function isn't defined there, the limit might be defined there. And actually it can go the other way around. Sometimes a function is defined there, but the limit is not, and we'll see that in future videos. But let's just get an understanding here. What's going on as x approaches negative four? As x approaches negative four from values greater than negative four and from values less than negative four. Well let's first think about values greater than negative four. So when x is negative one, this is f of negative one. This is f of negative two, this is f of negative three. This is f of negative 3.5, this is f of negative 3.9, this is f of negative 3.99, this is f of negative 3.99999. And so you can see the value of our function, as x gets closer and closer to negative four from values greater than negative four, seems to be approaching six. And let's see if that's true from the other direction, so from values less than negative four. So this f of negative seven, f of negative six. This is f of negative five, puts us around seven. This is f of negative 4.5, f of negative 4.1, f of negative 4.01, f of negative 4.00001, it looks like it's getting awfully, it's going to be a little bit more than six, so it seems as we get closer and closer to x equal negative four, the value of our function is approaching positive six.",math_calculus-all-old_limits-and-continuity-calc
"  Part C, find the particular solution-- W as a function of t-- to the differential equations, derivative of W with respect to t is equal to 1 over 25 times w minus 300, with initial condition, at time 0, W is equal to 1,400. And the units in this problem, it was 1,400 tons they told us. So it might seem strange to see a differential equations problem on an AP exam. You say, wait, this isn't fair. This isn't a differential equations class. And the thing to keep in mind is if, on an AP exam, you see differential equations, they're really asking you to solve a differential equation that can be solved using the skills that you would learn in an AP class. And the main class of differential equations that you could solve are the ones that are separable differential equations. The ones where you can separate the independent and the dependent variables. And if you don't have any idea what I'm talking about, I'm about to show you. So let me rewrite this differential equation. We have dw, dt is equal to 1 over 25 times W minus 300. Now this differential equation, we have W here. And we have this dt. But we don't have t anywhere else. So what I want to do is I want to get the parts that involve W onto the left-hand side, and I want to get anything that deals with dt on the right-hand side. So let's divide both sides of this equation by w minus 300. So we would have 1 over W minus 300 dw dt-- the derivative of W with respect to t-- is equal to-- I divide this side by W minus 300, so it's equal to 1 over 25. Now I want to get the dt's on this side. So let's multiply both sides by dt. [INAUDIBLE] the differential is just a very, very small change in t. And so we get-- and I'm a little bit imprecise with my notation here. But this is one way that you can think about it when you are dealing with the differential equations like this, separable differential equations. You have 1 over W minus 300 dw-- let me make sure that the dw doesn't look like it's in the denominator-- dw is equal to 1 over 25 dt. And now we can integrate both sides, which is essentially just saying that we're taking-- since this is equal to this-- that each little increment of W times this is equal to each little increment of dt times 1 over 25. We can then say, well, if we sum up all of the increments of W times this quantity-- if we sum up the infinite number of infinitesimally small increments-- that would be the same thing as summing up all of these characters. Because each of these characters is really the same as each of these characters. So let's do that sum. We're essentially just integrating both sides of this. And here, you might be able to do this in your head. Or we could do the formal u substitution, just to make it clear what we're doing. If you said u is equal to W minus 300, then what is du? If you wanted the differential. So if you want to take the derivative of u with respect to W, you would say du with respect to W is equal to what? It is equal to 1. The derivative of this with respect to W is 1. Or if you multiply both sides times dw, you have du is equal to dw. And so this left-hand side right over here-- this integral-- could be rewritten as the integral of 1 over u du. We define this as u. And we just saw that du is the same thing as dw, so this could be rewritten as du. And this is one of the basic integrals, so hopefully we've learned. And this is equal to the natural log of the absolute value of u. Or if you unwind the substitution, this is equal to the natural log of the absolute value of W minus 300. So let me write this down. So the left-hand side right over here. And you might be able do that in your head. You say, hey, look. You have W minus 300. Its derivative is 1, so it's essentially there. So I can just take this as if this was 1 over-- I could just take the antiderivative here and treat this whole thing as a variable. So it would just be the natural log of this entire thing, or the absolute value of that entire thing. So the integral of the left-hand side is the natural log of the absolute value of W minus 300. And the derivative of the right-hand side-- and this is a little bit more straightforward-- or sorry, the antiderivative with respect to t on the right-hand side is 1 over 25 t, or we could say t over 25.  And then these are both indefinite integrals. You could have a constant on both sides or one side. We could just put it on one side right over here. You could have put plus some constant. You could have added some C1 over here. And then you could've had C2 over here. But then you could've subtracted C1 from both sides, and then just have a C3 constant over here. But to simplify it, you could just say, look, this is going to be equal to this plus some constant. You could've put the constant on that side as well. It doesn't matter. All the constants would merge into one. Now we've gotten pretty far. We want to solve the particular solution. Right now, we only have this constant. And we also haven't written W as a function of t just right yet. They're implicitly expressed. It is more of a relationship than a function right now. So the first thing we can do is try to solve for C. We're told in the problem that W of 0 is equal to 1400 tons. They told us that. That's one of our initial conditions. So we know that the natural log, that when t is equal to 0, W is equal to 1400. So W is equal to 1,400 when t is equal to 0 plus C. Or another way to think about it is, the natural log of the absolute value of 1,100 is equal to C. And obviously, this is a positive value. So we could just say that C is equal to the natural log of 1,100. We can drop the absolute value sign because the absolute value of 1,100 is 1,100. So now we can rewrite this part right over here. Let me do it in yellow. Let me start-- that's not yellow. Let me start right over here. So we could write the natural log of the absolute value of W minus 300. And actually, we know that W is an increasing function. W starts at 1,400 and only goes up from there as t gets larger and larger. So if we're starting at 1,400 and only getting larger and larger values for W, this expression right here is never going to get negative for positive t values. And that's all we care about. And so we can actually drop the absolute value sign. This will always be a positive value. So we could say the absolute value of W minus 300 is equal to t over 25-- and we've just solved for our constant-- plus the natural log of 1,100. And now we can just solve this explicitly for W. We can raise e to both sides. This value is equal to this value. The left hand side is equal to the right hand side. So e raised to this power is the same thing as e raised to that power. So we have e to the natural log of W minus 300 is going to be equal to e to the t over 25 plus the natural log of 1,100. Let me take this-- actually, just to get the real estate, let me delete that. All right. Now I can keep working right below that. And so e to the natural log of something is just going to be equal to that something. The natural log is what power do I have to raise e to to get this thing. Well I'm raising e to that power, so I'm going to get this thing. So the left-hand side just becomes W minus 300, and the right-hand side, we could rewrite this as e to the t over 25 times e to the natural log of 1,100. We have the same base, different exponents. If you wanted to simplify this, you would just add the exponents, which is exactly what we did up here. So these two things are equivalent. e to the natural log of 1,100, that is 1,100. The natural log of 1,100 is a power that you raise e to to get to 1,100. So if you raise e to that power, you get 1,100. So that is 1,100. So we get W minus 300 is equal to 1,100 e to the t over 25. And then you just add 300 to both sides. W is equal to 1,100 e to the t over 25 plus 300. And we're done. We have solved the differential equation. We found the particular solution. We had to solve for C to find that particular solution. We're done. And we did it using just basic integration. We didn't have to use any of the fancy differential equation solving tools that you might learn in a more advanced class.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-solved-exams
" -  Hello again, in the last video we were looking at vector fields that only have an X component, basically meaning all of the vectors point just purely to the left or to the right, with nothing up and down going on. Then we landed at the idea that the divergence of V, you know when you take the divergence of this vector valued function, it should definitely have something to do with the partial derivative of P, that X component of the output, with respect to X, and here I wanna do the opposite, and say, okay, what if we look at functions where that P, that first component is zero, but then we have some kind of positive Q component, some kind of positive, well maybe not positive, but some kind of non-zero, so positive or negative Y component, and what this would mean, instead of thinking about vector as just left and right, now we're looking at vectors that are purely up or down, kind of up or down. So kind of doing the same thing we did last time, if we start thinking about cases where the divergence of our function at a given point should be positive, and an example of that, you might be saying, nothing is happening at the point itself, so Q itself would be zero but then below it, things are kind of going away so they're pointing down, and above it, things are going up. So in this case down here, Q is a little bit less than zero, the Y component of that vector is less than zero, and up here, Q is greater than zero. So here we have the idea that as you're going from the bottom up, the Y value of your input is increasing as you're moving upward in space, the value of Q, this Y component of the output, should also be increasing because it goes from negative to zero to positive. So now you're starting to get this idea of partial Q with respect to Y, you know, as we change that Y and move up in space, the value of Q should be positive, so positive divergence seems to correspond to a positive value here. And the thinking is actually gonna be almost identical to what we did in the last video with the X component, because you can think of another circumstance where maybe you actually have a vector attached to your point and something's going on, and there even is some convergence towards it, where you have some fluid flow in towards the point, but it's just heavily outweighed by even higher divergence, even higher flow away from your point above it, and again you have this idea of Q starts off small, so here's kind of, Q starts off small, maybe it's kind of like near zero, and then here Q is something positive and then here it's even more positive, and sort of making up notation here but I want the idea of kind of small and then medium-sized and then bigger, and once again, the idea of partial derivative of Q with respect to Y being greater than zero seems to correspond to positive divergence, and if you want, you can sketch out many more circumstances and think about what if the vector started off pointing down, what would positive and negative and zero divergence all look like, but the upshot of it all, pretty much for the same reasons I went through in the last video, is this partial derivative with respect to Y corresponds to the divergence. And when we combine this with our conclusions about the X component, that actually is all you need to know for the divergence. So just to write it all out, if we have a vector valued function of X and Y, and it's got both of its components, we've got P as the X component of the output, that first component of the output, and Q, and we're looking at both of these at once, the way that we compute divergence, the definition of divergence of this vector valued function, is to say divergence of V as a function of X and Y, is actually equal to the partial derivative of P with respect to X, plus, the partial derivative of Q with respect to Y. And that's it, that is the formula for divergence, and hopefully by now, this isn't just kind of a formula that I'm plopping down for you, but it's something that makes intuitive sense, when you see this term, this partial P with respect to X, you're thinking about, oh yes, yes, because if you have flow that's kind of increasing as you move in the X direction, that's gonna correspond with movement away, and this partial derivative of Q with respect to Y term, hopefully you're thinking, ah yes, as you're increasing the Y component of your vector around your point, that corresponds with less flow in than there is out, so both of these correspond to that idea of divergence that we're going for, and if you just add them up, this gives you everything you need to know. And one thing that's pretty neat, and maybe kind of surprising, is that the way we just came across this formula, and started to think about it, was in the simplified case, where you have, you know, just pure movement in the X direction or pure movement in the Y direction, but in reality, as we know, vector fields can look much more complicated, and maybe you have something where you know, it's not just in the X direction, and there's lots of things going on and you need to account for all of those, and evidently, just looking at the change in the X component with respect to X, or the change in the Y component of the output with respect to the Y component of the input, gives you all the information you need to know. And basically what's going on here is that any fluid flow can just be broken down into the X and Y components where you're just looking at each vector, you know, whatever vector you have, it could be broken down into it's own X and Y components and if you wanna think kind of concretely about the fluid flow idea, maybe you'd say that for your point, if you're looking at a point in space, you picture a very small box around it, and the reason you only need to think about X components and Y components is that you're only really looking at, you know, what's going on on the left and right side, and then you can kind of calculate what the divergence according to fluid flowing in through those sides is, and then you just look at kind of, fluid flowing through the top or the bottom, and if you kinda shrink this box down, all you really care about is those two different directions, and anything else, anything that's kind of a diagonal into it, is really just broken down into what's the Y component there, what's the, you know, how is it contributing to movement up through that bottom part of the box, and then what's the X component, how's it contributing to movement through that side part of the box. But anyway, I mean the upshot here is just that the formula for divergence only involves these two components.",math_multivariable-calculus_multivariable-derivatives
" -  What we're going to do in this video is talk about the idea of a residual plot for a given regression and the data that it's trying to explain. So right over here, we have a fairly simple least squares regression. We're trying to fit four points. And in previous videos, we actually came up with the equation of this least squares regression line. What I'm going to do now is plot the residuals for each of these points. So what is a residual? Well, just as a reminder, your residual for a given point is equal to the actual minus the expected. So how do I make that tangible? Well, what's the residual for this point right over here? For this point here, the actual y when x equals one is one, but the expected, when x equals one for this least squares regression line, 2.5 times one minus two, well, that's gonna be .5. And so our residual is one minus .5, so we have a positive, we have a positive 0.5 residual. Over for this point, you have zero residual. The actual is the expected. For this point right over here, the actual, when x equals two, for y is two, but the expected is three. So our residual over here, once again, the actual is y equals two when x equals two. The expected, two times 2.5 minus two is three, so this is going to be two minus three, which equals a residual of negative one. And then over here, our residual are actual. When x equals three is six, our expected when x equals three is 5.5. So six minus 5.5, that is a positive 0.5. So those are the residuals, but how do we plot it? Well, we would set up or axes. Let me do it right over here. One, two, and three. And let's see, the maximum residual here is positive .5 and then the minium one here is negative one. So let's see, this could be .5, one. negative .5, negative one. So this is negative one. This is positive one here. And so when x equals one, what was the residual? Well, the actual was one, expected was 0.5, one minus 0.5 is 0.5. So this right over here, we can plot right over here. The residual is 0.5. When x equals two, we actually have two data points. First, I'll do this one. When we have the point two comma three, the residual there is zero. So for one of them, the residual is zero. Now for the other one, the residual is negative one. Let me do that in a different color. For the other one, the residual is negative one, so we would plot it right over here. And then this last point, the residual is positive .5. So it is just like that. And so this thing that I have just created, where we're just seeing, for each x where we have a corresponding point, we plot the point above or below the line based on the residual. This is called a residual plot. Now, one question is why do people even go through the trouble of creating a residual plot like this. The answer is, regardless of whether the regression line is upward sloping or downward sloping, this gives you a sense of how good a fit it is and whether a line is good at explaining the relationship between the variables. The general idea is if you see the point pretty evenly scattered or randomly scattered above and below this line, you don't really discern any trend here, then a line is probably a good model for the data. But if you do see some type of trend, if the residuals had an upward trend like this or if they were curving up and then curving down, or they had a downward trend, then you might say, ""Hey, this line isn't a good fit, ""and maybe we would have to do a non-linear model."" What are some examples of other residual plots? And let's try to analyze them a bit. So right here you have a regression line and its corresponding residual plot. And once again, you see here, the residual is slightly positive. The actual is slightly above the line, and you see it right over there, it's slightly positive. This one's even more positive, you see it there. But like the example we just looked at, it looks like these residuals are pretty evenly scattered above and below the line. There isn't any discernible trend. And so I would say that a linear model here, and in particular, this regression line, is a good model for this data. But if we see something like this, a different picture emerges. When I look at just the residual plot, it doesn't look like they're evenly scattered. It looks like there's some type of trend here. I'm going down here, but then I'm going back up. When you see something like this, where on the residual plot you're going below the x-axis and then above, then it might say, ""Hey, a linear model ""might not be appropriate. ""Maybe some type of non-linear model. ""Some type of non-linear curve ""might better fit the data,"" or the relationship between the y and the x is non-linear. Another way you could think about it is when you have a lot of residuals that are pretty far away from the x-axis in the residual plot, you'd also say, ""This line isn't such a good fit."" If you calculate the R value here, it would only be slightly positive, but it would not be close to one.",math_ap-statistics_bivariate-data-ap
" - When little kids say they want to grow up to be a scientist, here's what they actually mean. They wanna blow things up in a laboratory setting. They wanna get bitten by a radioactive monkey which will turn them into a terrifying humanoid battle monkey. Or they wanna make a fly with eyeballs on its butt or like a chicken with fangs. Most the time scientists don't get to do that stuff. Like you may blow something up, but it's either gonna be in like a really controlled setting or it will be an accident, in which case it's bad. Like the lab where I first worked, the first lab I ever worked in had a blood stain on the ceiling. But if you're a scientist specializing in the amazing new discipline of evolutionary development biology you may just get to make a fly with eyeballs on its butt or even a chicken with teeth. But not battle monkeys. (upbeat music) So evolutionary developmental biology or evo-devo for all of us cool kids is a new science that looks deep into our genes to figure out how exactly they give instructions to make different parts of our bodies. And as the name suggests, it's giving us some hot leads into the nature and the mechanisms behind evolution. One big thing it's showing us is that animals, all animals are way more similar than we ever imagined. You know how you always hear about how humans and chimps and are 98.6% genetically similar. It kinda makes sense right? 'Cause chimps and humans, you could see that we kinda, kinda look alike. Like if you walked into a coffee shop and there's a chimp sitting in the chair and it's like maybe wearing a fedora or something, you might briefly mistake that chimp for human. You might not even notice it's sittin' there. It could happen. But what about a mouse? You are not going to mistake a mouse for a person. How genetically similar do you think we are with mice? How about 85% similar. - [Male] Shut up. - No I won't shut up. Humans and mice are 85% genetically identical. So why then are mice like little and skittery, covered in white fur and have beady little eyes, while I can like walk upright in a non-skittery way and have beautiful, deep, mysterious eyes? I'll give you the long answer in a minute, but for now, the short answer is, it's all because of the incredibly weird and amazingly powerful genes called developmental regulatory genes. Mostly when we're thinking of genes we think of the things that code for some useful enzyme or protein like the ones that determine what our ankles are going to look like. But those ankle genes don't just come on and off at random. They have to be turned on and off. That's what these developmental regulatory genes do. They activate the genes that put the body parts together. They don't tell them how to do it, mind you, they just tell them when or if it's time to get to work. And since they're the ones pretty much calling the plays, regulatory genes start working rather early in embryonic development. For instance, a kind of a regulatory gene called gap genes are responsible for telling the blastula, that little hollow ball of cells that forms during the early stages development, like a make a mouth here, and let's put an anus over on this other end. Probably the amazing kind of regulatory genes are the homeobox genes or Hox genes which kick into gear after the embryo is more developed. Hox genes literally control the identity of body parts, setting up how an animal's body is organized. Like here's where you put the leg and here's where you put the tail. And like I said, these Hox genes don't give instructions or how to create legs and tails, there are a bunch of other genes that are in charge of the actual craftsmanship of the body parts. You could think of the Hox genes as like the head architects in the construction of a building. They've got the master plan, but they don't do any of the construction themselves, that's way beneath them. Because under this top tier of regulatory genes there are scads of other genes that act as like subcontractors. Like if a Hox gene tells its direct subordinates, make an eye here, the subordinates, then turn around, activate other regulatory genes to give more specific instructions, like this is were we gotta put the collagen for the outer shell of the eyeball. And make some nerve tissue for a retina right here. Again, these second tier genes and third tier and fourth tier and on down the line, don't actually do any of the work, they just send instructions down the chain of command adding more specific information to the instructions as they go. It's a really rigid hierarchy. No gene in your body aside from that very first one does anything until it's told when and how much to do it. So because I know that you're such a, sort of intelligent and curious student, I know what you're wondering right now. What activates that first regulatory gene and how in the name of Bill McGinnis, did they tell each other to do stuff? Well since evo-devo is a relatively new discipline, we don't really know all the stuff that I wish we knew. That's you to figure out when you become a biologist. Scientists are starting to think that a lot of the human genome, that has until recently been considered junk DNA, because it apparently doesn't code for anything might actually be regulatory genes. For instance, just in the past few years, we've learned that humans have about 230 separate Hox genes in our genome and they appear on everyone of our chromosomes, even the sex chromosomes. How regulatory genes are inherited is also still being studied. From what scientists have been able to deduce so far, most regulatory genes are inherited very much the same way as all of your other genes. But for some really early stage regulatory genes the proteins that they're coded to produce called gene products have already been made and are sitting in the egg before it's fertilized, waiting to tell the embryonic cells what to do to get the ball rolling. Another thing that your mom did for you that you probably never her thanked her for. Something that's a really cool thing, even though most regulatory genes are inherited each individual within a species tends to have the exact same DNA sequence in those genes. There aren't even different alleles. And when you think about it, they kinda have to be the same, since all individuals of a species should be built from the same basic blueprint. Like you don't want people walking around with thumbs stickin' outta their heads. Now this gets me back to me and my beady-eyed friend, the mouse. Hox genes and other regulatory genes that are at the very highest tier, the ones that say like head here, and eye here not only tend to be the same within a species, they're also very similar across different animal groups, like between all mammals, or even all vertebrates. The differences between my regulatory genes and a mouse's regulatory genes are way down the chain the chain of commands, where the instructions are the most specific. For the big picture stuff, like you're a vertebrate and you have four limbs and you have hair and breast tissue and ear bones all that stuff that all mammals have, all those general instructions are the same. And that's why 85% of human's genetic makeup is the same as mice, mices, mouse, mice, meeces. (lively ragtime piano music) Okay, you've been very patient my students, so I've got a surprise for you. We're gonna make some butt eyeballs. 1995, in a very cool and also totally messed experiment a team of researchers in Switzerland took a Hox gene from a mouse embryo, one that said, eye goes here, and inserted it into the DNA of a developing fruit fly embryo. But they activated the mouse eyeball gene in a region of the fly that would become the fly's back leg. And so what do you think happened? I'm not gonna tell you yet, 'cause I want you to guess. Wrong, the fruit fly did not grow a mouse eyeball next to it's back leg, it grew a fruit fly eye next to it's back leg. Remember, the gene didn't say how to make an eye, it just gave the instruction to make an eye. If it had said how to make the eye, you'd get a mouse eye on the fruit fly's butt. Instead it told the fruit fly cells make an eye here and those fruit fly cells had their own instructions regulated by another whole set of regulatory genes and once they got the order to make the eye they made the only way they knew how. That is pretty fricken messed up, but also fricken awesome. Now in addition to getting me in touch with my inner mentally unstable child scientist, this kind of experiment is where evo-devo has begun to really revolutionize our understanding of evolution. Because we've known that evolution can take place over a really long time but we haven't really be able to figure out how it sometimes happens really fast. Traditionally one of the main ways that scientists have explained evolution is through genetic mutations. But an organism would have to do a lot of mutating, to evolve from say a dinosaur into a bird. It used to be thought that that a 50% change in form would require a 50% mutation in genes, which would take a long time, way longer than the pace at which we see things actually evolving. But it turns out that a small change in a regulatory gene up at the top of the chain of command can have huge effects on how an organism is actually assembled. To understand how this works, let's look at why birds don't have teeth. So birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs which are just these fricken sweet dinosaurs like velociraptors, which look a lot like birds, but you know way more awesome and with big razor sharp teeth. But you may have noticed that birds don't have razor sharp teeth, they have beaks. Under the old way of thinking about evolution the loss of the teeth would have had to happen very slowly as the genes make enamel and dentin gradually mutated to make less and less and less of each of those things until they made none at all. And for a long time, that's just how we thought dinosaurs evolved into birds. But there was one problem, it would have taken way longer for all of those mutations to occur that it actually took for dinosaurs to evolve into birds based on the fossil record. Fortunately evo-devo is offering us an explanation. A single mutation in the regulatory genes could have shut off the enamel and dentin production and another mutation in another regulatory gene could have upped the keratin production from the level of make some scales, to the level of make a beak. So birds actually do still have genes for teeth from their dinosaurian ancestors, they're just not expressed because the regulators don't turn them on. But how do we know that? Well, in 2006, a biologist at the University of Wisconsin named John Fallon who studies birth defects was lookin' at some mutant chicken embryos and noticed that the had formed little teeth, like little baby reptile teeth. It turns out that the mutations affected the chicken's gene regulation allowing the teeth, a feature lost to birds around 60 million years ago, to just pop back up again. The same sort of crazy throwback features have been observed in snakes born with legs like their ancestors once had or blind cave fish suddenly born with eyes. If you turn those genes back on, 1those ancient repressed features come back. 1It's crazy, I know. 1That's so cool. 1I don't (mumbling) 1it's all fairly new science 1so this is still like in my head 1just like really fantasinating. 1That's word I made up.",science_biology_crash-course-bio-ecology
" Let's think a little bit about the different clues that have led us to conclude that we have these lithospheric plates moving relative to each other. Now, the first clue, and this is something that I think many students even in elementary school first experience when they first learn about geography, is that it looks like the continents could kind of fit into each other. And the most obvious one of these is when you look at this kind of little pointy part of South America, and if you have a more detailed map it really is amazing, how well it seems to fit into the Nigerian Basin right here in Africa. It looks like at one time this little pointy part was nudged into this part of Africa, that they were actually connected. And if you're a little bit more creative, there are other parts of the world that you can kind of start to see how they might have fit in with each other in the past. And that by itself, that's just a very small clue, but it kind of hints at well, maybe if they at one time were fitting next to each other, if this was kind of connected, then they've had to moved apart at some time. Although it doesn't tell us that it's still moving or what might have caused the movement. And it definitely doesn't definitively tell us that they even moved. Maybe this is just a coincidence that this coast of South America looks very similar to this coast right here of Africa. Now, the next clues truly came over I would say about the last 60 or 70 years. The first clue is that OK, if you go to the mid-Atlantic ridge right here-- So if you look at the Atlantic Ocean. Let me look at this photograph right over here. You don't normally see the oceans highlighted like this. So let me make it very clear to you. This right here is South America. This right here is Africa. This right here is North America. And so if you actually look at the elevations in the middle of the ocean people noticed in the middle of the 20th century that gee, there's a ridge in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. There's kind of a mountain range that goes straight up the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. So that by itself doesn't tell you that you have these plates that are moving apart, but it is kind of a curious thing to look at. And not only is there this ridge. There's lot of underwater volcanic activity. You have magma flowing out and lava flowing out into the water, and it's kind of forming this ridge that really goes across the whole Atlantic Ocean. There are other ridges in the world like that, underwater ridges. You have one over here in the Pacific Ocean. You have these here in the Indian Ocean. That's just a little clue, but that by itself doesn't tell you that these plates are actually moving apart at the ridge. The more conclusive-- this is just the beginning of the clue-- but what made this conclusive is one, the separate discovery. And this is what's interesting is that you have these separate discoveries in different domains that eventually let you come to a pretty neat conclusion. So you've had a separate discovery that if you look at different eras of magnetic rock, or maybe I should say magnetic rock from different periods in geologic time. And you can tell where they are in geologic time by how they're layered. So this would be newer rock. And then this would be a little bit older. And then this would be even, even older. Geologists noticed something interesting. If I were to take magnetic rock, and if it was molten lava, and if it were to harden, remember it's magnetic rock so it would want to align with the poles the same way a compass would. So if I had a bunch of magnetic-- so let's say this is some lava right here. And so the molecules can align themselves. Since it's a liquid and they can align themselves, they are going to naturally want to align with the poles. So they'll naturally all want to align in one direction because of Earth's magnetic field. And so when that lava hardens into actual rock that alignment will kind of be frozen. Now, if Earth's magnetic field was constant over time, then when you look at magnetic rocks from any period, you would expect them all to be aligned in the same direction. So since we're taking a cross section of rock here let's say an alignment towards the North pole looks like this. And I draw it like that. That's kind of an arrow pointing into our screen. And let's say an alignment pointing to the South pole would look like this. This would be an arrow pointing out of our screen. So what you would expect is the newer rock that kind of the alignment, the field, the alignment of the rock, would go into the screen, and then the older rock, it would still go older into the screen. So if I were to draw a top view-- Let me draw it like this just so I make sure that everyone is on the same page. So let me just draw a cross section like this so that we know what we're talking about. And so this is the surface up here. This up here is the surface. When I talk about going into the page that means that the magnetic rock would be aligned in that direction. And when I talk about going out of the page it means, so if I were to draw it like that, that means that the magnetic rock would be aligned in that direction. Now, like I said, if the magnetic field of Earth never changed, then lava that essentially cools down into non-lava rock, or you can say freezes into rock, it would all point into the same direction regardless of when it hardened. This would be the situation in a constant magnetic field. But what we've seen is that that's not the case. When you look at older magnetic rock, and depending on how old you go, you have the newer rock that's aligned with our current magnetic field. You go a little bit older, and right now we think it's about 780,000 years ago roughly. You have to find rock of that age, magnetic rock that hardened at that time. It's actually in the opposite direction. So actually, the magnetic rock has hardened in a way so it's as if the North Pole was at the South Pole now, the magnetic North pole. So it's aligned in the opposite direction. So it's kind of pointing out of the page here. And then if you get even older rock, it's more aligned with our traditional direction. So it's more aligned than that. And so the only reasonable conclusion that we can draw from this is that Earth's magnetic field has actually fluctuated over time. Now, you're probably thinking, Sal, how is this relevant to plate tectonics? Well, once you accept that magnetic fields fluctuate over the history of the Earth, there's another interesting observation you can make about the rock that's kind of at the basin of the ocean floor. So not only do you have this mid-Atlantic ridge, you have these volcanoes spewing kind of new rock into the ocean, creating this kind of underwater mountain ridge, but it also turns out that the rock that forms the sea floor also contains a lot of magnetite, which is magnetic. And what's really interesting about that-- so let me draw. So we're going to have a top view just like we have over here. So let's say this is the mid-Atlantic ridge right here. Now, this is really cool. So when they look at rocks that are very close to the mid-Atlantic ridge, they're aligned-- and once again, we're looking at rocks at the floor of the ocean-- they're aligned in a way that you would expect with the current magnetic field. They are aligned just like that, the way that you would expect when you're looking at the magnetic rock that's close to the ridge. But if you go a little bit further, and when I say a little bit I'm talking about thousands of miles, but when you go further out from that you have stripes of other magnetic rock that is going in the opposite direction. It's going like this. And what's even cooler than the idea that it's switched directions depending on how far you've gone from the rift is that there's a symmetric stripe of magnetic rock on exactly the same distance, or roughly the same distance away from the rift that's also pointing in that same direction. And you go a little bit further out and you'll find some rock that's pointing in the original direction. And even better, you go on the symmetric other side of the actual ridge and you find another set of rocks that's doing the exact same thing. So if you accept that Earth's magnetic field has kind of been flip flopping over time, the only reasonable conclusion, at least that I could think of, or the geologists can think of, is that sure, all of this was formed at a similar period in time. This came out as lava, magnetic lava, and then it all aligned with Earth's magnetic field. And that's why it looks similar. You fast forward in time some and the only way-- Or actually, let's not fast forward in time. The only way that these could have formed, and they could have been so similar. So if we rewind in time, the only way that these purple magnetic rocks could have aligned this way in exactly the same way and exactly the same distance is if at some point they were much closer to each other, if they were actually connected. So if we rewind in time maybe at the mid-Atlantic rift 1you had all of the purple rock coming out 1from those underwater volcanoes, and at that time, 1Earth's magnetic field was the opposite as it is right now. 1And then of course, you had this blue rock 1that is looking like that. 1And so this seems like a reasonable explanation. 1This rock and this rock were at some point touching. 1They were actually formed at the exact place 1and at the same time. 1And so if this is the case, if at one point 1this purple rock was all together, 1and they formed at the same time at the mid-Atlantic rift, 1we're assuming all the rock was-- well, 1we don't have to make that assumption-- 1but if you assume that they've formed at the same time, 1and that based on the pattern it really does look like they do, 1and it's a symmetric distance away from that rift, 1then the only reasonable conclusion I can think of 1is that the rift has had to move apart. 1The rift has had to move apart from this period 1to that period. 1And there was a time when all this blue rock was together. 1So that by itself, that frankly is the most definitive evidence 1in the 1960s where it kind of became conclusive that you did 1have these plates that were moving away from each other. 1And obviously if the plates are moving away from each other 1at some point, and that means that just based on the way 1the map looks, at some point they're also 1going to be moving into each other. 1We could talk more about that in future videos. 1But, you know, at certain points one plate 1is moving under another. 1And we'll talk about how that might partially explain, 1and we'll talk about all of the explanations 1for why we think the plates might actually be moving. 1But now, if we fast forward to more present times now 1that we have GPS satellites and all the rest, 1we can actually measure the movement of the plates. 1This is actually an image from NASA 1showing the vector of the movements 1at different points on the surface of the planet. 1And you can see we've gotten a lot of vectors 1from the United States, so it's almost hard to read 1since it's so chalk full of vectors. 1But you can see right over here in Hawaii. 1The Pacific Plate at that point is moving in this Northwest 1direction as measured by GPS satellites. 1And I want to make clear, this movement is relatively slow. 1It's roughly the speed at which fingernails grow, 1but if you do it over millions of years, 1that actually amounts to thousands of miles. 1So we're talking on the order of about a centimeter a year 1for most of the plates. 1Some of the plates might be moving a little bit faster, 1maybe close to 10 or 15 centimeters, 1but most are moving about a centimeter 1a year, at the same rate your fingernails are going. 1But this is fascinating because we can actually measure it, 1because GPS is so accurate. 1Over here it looks like the North American plate 1is kind of rotating generally in that direction. 1The Nazca Plate right here is moving roughly 1in that direction, moving into the South American Plate. 1I'll leave you there right now. 1And actually before I leave you there, 1this is another thing that I got off 1the Wikipedia that shows that same magnetic striping. 1It's maybe a slightly neater drawing. 1I don't know which one might be more helpful for you. 1But I'll leave you there in this video. 1In the next video, we'll think about some of the theories. 1We know now that the plates are moving. 1Let's think about some of the theories 1as to why they might actually be moving.",science_cosmology-and-astronomy_earth-history-topic
" - Hi there, just hangin' out with some of my distant relatives here, and I gotta say, I've got a lot of respect for these guys, because they are some of the most successful organisms on the Earth. We think we run things on this planet, but we don't, they do. On one acre of cultivated land, annelids like this earthworm process about 16,000 pounds of soil a year, which makes plant life, and our lives, therefore possible. And not only are there about a billion, billion arthropods like this in the world, that's 10 to the 18th power, by the way, but also 80% of known animal species are arthropods. Now don't get me wrong, even though bugs and spiders and worms and shrimp totally outnumber us humans, we are far more complex than them when it comes to, like, arm-wrestling and guitar playing and long division we totally school them. But complexity like ours had to start somewhere. And it started with a very special trait that we share with these animals. Can you see the resemblance? (peppy rock music) Last time we talked about how in the very simplest animals there are two traits that indicate an animal's relative complexity. There's how many germ layer they develop when they're embryos and whether or not they have a coelom, or a body cavity that holds their organs. So it's in the next two phyla, Annelida and Arthropoda, where we find the new big thing in animal complexity: segmentation. Segmentation is the repetition of anatomically identical units that can be added to and modified to serve different purposes as animals evolve. And evolution is the way to win it, folks. In fact, the three biggest and most diverse groups of animals in the world are the ones that display segmentation: Annelida, Arthropoda, and Chordate, which includes the vertebrates. All segmented animals have a common ancestor that probably lived about 600 million years ago. That's how long ago it was when one of your grandparents and one of the earthworm's grandparents and one of the beetle's grandparents all played on the same softball team, pretty crazy. Segmentation has proven to be unbelievably useful from an evolutionary perspective. In humans, you see anatomically identical pieces repeated along an axis, from our butts to our heads. They can be a little hard to see because they're so highly modified, but think about our vertebrae, they're segments, our ribs are segments, the cartilage around our trachea, those are segments. Even the folds in our brains are segments. They're crazy evolved segments, but segments just the same. Among today's animal phyla, the earlier to display segmentation is Annelida, which includes leeches and earthworms and lugworms. See how their whole bodies look like rings fused together? Segments. In fact, the word Annelida comes from the Greek for little rings, and when you look at an annelid, you see that they're all really obviously segmented. Now this segmentation is a great example of synapomorphy in annelids. Synapomorphies are traits that set one group of animals apart from its ancestors and from other groups that came from the same ancestor. So unlike their flatworm and nematode cousins, annelids are segmented. And they've also got little bristles on their bodies, called chaetae, that provide traction and help them move through the dirt. These are both little extra somethings that annelids have that less complex relatives don't have, and that their common ancestors didn't have. Synapomorphies, literally shared, derived traits, are usually the defining traits of a phylum. But you can also learn something about an animal's lineage by comparing plesiomorphies: very basic traits that are shared by animals with a common ancestry. So between the Platyhelminthes and the nematodes and the annelids, one plesiomorphy is that they're all worm-shaped, which tells you that they have a common, distant ancestor that was wormy looking. So as we talk about these phyla and the classes within them, notice how they're similar and different from each other. For instance, within Annelida there are three different classes. Everybody's favorite, of course, is the Oligochaetes, the earthworms. Their name refers to the synapomorphy I just mentioned, they have chaetae, or bristles, but only an oligo, few of them. And they're everyone's favorite because they eat soil and crap it out the other end, allowing air and water to circulate in the soil. Plus, their poo is rich in things that plants need to grow, like nitrogen and calcium and magnesium and phosphorus, and now I'm gonna go watch my hands. Now on to the class Hirudinea, the leeches, a lot of which are parasitic and, you know, eat blood and other bodily fluids. The synapomorphy of leeches are their powerful suckers, they've got them on both ends of their bodies, the posterior one being used to anchor itself while the anterior one that surrounds its mouth attaches to its host. All leech species are carnivorous and they are hermaphrodites, like earthworms. Now, the Polychaetes are bristly worms, hence a synapomorphy of this class is their poly, many, chaetae, bristles. Almost all of these are marine species and they're really diverse, but the ones you've probably seen evidence of are lugworms, the ones that dig holes at the beach and leave piles of castings on the sand. Okay, I know, you've had enough of worms. And now we've got Arthropoda to talk about, and that's very easy to do because there are a lot of them. Like I said, they totally outnumber us. Just to put things into perspective, there are more insects in a square mile of rural land than there are human beings on the earth. One reason that scientists think arthropods do so well has to do with their, you guessed it, segmented bodies! Fossils of early arthropods showed that there used to be very little variation between the segments. But as they evolved, segments fused and became specialized for different functions, which led to crazy amounts of diversity. So much diversity that Arthropoda includes stuff like scorpions, butterflies, and lobsters, which I know, seems like maybe a bit of a stretch, but here are the synapomorphies that make them all arthropods. One, they have segmented bodes that, in most cases, are broken up into three segments: head, thorax and abdomen. And check this out, here segmentation in arthropods is a good example of plesiomorphy. It's a basic ancient trait that they share with annelids and us chordates, for that matter, dating back to that softball game our forebears played some 600 million years ago. Two, all arthropods have an exoskeleton, a hard outer shell made out of chitin, which is a really tough carbohydrate that's chemically similar to the cellulose that you find in plants. And, in order to grow bigger they actually have to shed it. And be glad that you don't have to do that, because it looks like kind of a traumatic experience for them. Finally, they've all got paired and jointed appendages, which is actually where their name comes from. Arthropod means jointed feet, but it's not just their legs that are jointed, some of them have claws and jointed antennae, and they all have these external mouthparts that are also jointed. So that's what arthropods have in common, but they are grouped into four subphyla based on how they differ from each other. First, and perhaps most terrifying, you have your Cheliceriformes, which include spiders and scorpions, but also horseshoe crabs, which are kinda nice, and ticks, which aren't, and mites, which don't bother you at all. Probably, they might. Cheliceriformes comes from the Greek for arm-lips, which, whatever Greeks, refer to their long, fang-like pincers. Unlike a lot of arthropods, they have simple eyes with just one lens and not compound eyes, like flies, and they lack antennae. Most Cheliceriformes are landlubbers, but the fossil record tell us that a lot of them were marine back in the olden days. Sea spiders and horseshoe crabs are the only ones left now. The largest class of Cheliceriformes are the arachnids, the group that includes spiders and scorpions and ticks and mites. And they have what's called a cephalothorax, which is a head segment and a thorax segment fused together with eight legs and an abdomen behind. Most arachnids are carnivorous or parasitic, and they're very skittery, just sayin'. Next, Myriapoda, or many feet, includes what you would expect, the millipedes and centipedes. These are where the arthropods were like, let's see how far we can take this segmentation thing, shall we? All myriapods are terrestrial and have antennae and sort of scary jaw-like mandibles. Millipedes are vegetarians, and they may have been some of the very first animals to live on land, where there were mosses and primitive vascular plants for them to munch. Also, although millipedes have a crap ton of legs, they don't have as many as a thousand, as their name implies. They've actually got anywhere between 94 and 394 legs, depending on the species. Centipedes, whose name is a little more apt, as they generally have between 20 and 350 legs, are carnivores and have poisoned claws to paralyze their prey. So if you're looking to cuddle with a myriapod I'm going to advise you to go with the millipede. But please, save some love for the Hexapoda, meaning six feet, most of which are insects. The synapomorphies they share are three part bodies consisting of a head, a thorax, and an abdomen, three pairs of jointed legs that come off the thorax, compound eyes, and two antennae. Now, think of any random way you could put these characteristics together, and you'd probably come up with something that exists, because you guys, there are so many damn insects out there, you have no idea. There are more species of insects than there are all other animal species combined. Which is why I'm taking this opportunity to do a Biolo-graphy, the insects edition. (cheery piano music) Very little is understood about the evolution of insects, but scientists think that they probably split off from their crustacean cousins about 410 million years ago. And for tens of millions of years, insects and some little skittery invertebrates were about the only land dwelling animals. About 320 million years ago, thanks to the high oxygen levels of the Carboniferous period, some insects grew to be terrifyingly big. Like the Meganeura, which looked like a dragonfly with a two-foot wingspan. But, since an insect's size is restrained by its respiratory system, as oxygen levels went down, these massive insects couldn't circulate enough oxygen to keep their gigantic bodies going, and they died off. The next major milestone of insect history occurred around 120 million years ago, which is when most flowering plants evolved. 1And with it, the sweet spirit of cooperation 1that insects and flowering plants still share to this day. 1In fact, some insects and flowering plants 1have co-evolved really neat pollination strategies 1so they basically evolved together. 1Which I think is really sweet. 1And as a result of insect pollination, 1flowering plants are now the overlords of the plant world. 1And thus, everything smells nicer and looks prettier. 1Thanks, insects. 1Insects are the only arthropods that have developed 1the ability to fly and it has served them well. 1Insects' wings are just extensions of the cuticle 1of the thorax, so unlike birds and bats, 1which have to sacrifice walking legs 1in order to evolve wings, insects are just 1as graceful on the ground as they are in the air. 1But in order to be so awesome, insects had 1to develop this crazy thing called metamorphosis. 1In partial metamorphosis, the young, called nymphs, 1look exactly like the adult of the species 1and undergo a series of molts which allows them 1to get bigger and bigger, but they look 1basically the same the whole time. 1Most of the types of arthropods do this 1and some insects, including grasshoppers and cockroaches. 1However, complete metamorphosis is a process unique 1to some insects that lets them completely change shape. 1Maggots turn into flies, mealworms turn into beetles, 1caterpillars turn into butterflies. 1The baby insect, called a larva, I have one right here, 1this is a rhinoceros beetle larva. 1(laughs) Pretty gross! 1Hangs out and eats until it's time to build a little 1case around itself, called a pupa. 1This is the rhinoceros beetle pupa, 1which is exceptionally creepy. 1(laughs) 1And then when it comes out of the pupa, 1it's fully grown rhinoceros beetle. 1It's like soft at first, and then its chitin 1hardens up and it becomes the adult. 1So insects, basically wizards, but not as delicious 1as Crustacea, the insects of the sea. 1Crustaceans include crabs, lobsters, shrimp, and barnacles, 1and like insects, they have three body segments, 1head, thorax, and abdomen. 1Although some have a cephalothorax, like spiders do. 1While most other arthropods have learned 1to love the land, very few crustaceans have. 1They have decided to put their energy into developing 1other amazing characteristics. 1For instance, lobsters and crayfish 1are like walking multi-tools, 1they have 19 pairs of appendages, 1some of which are claws, some are mouth parts, 1some are regular old walkin' legs. 1Some shrimp have evolved bioluminescence, 1which is pretty much the most amazing thing 1any animal can do as far as I can tell. 1And this yeti crab looks like a yeti! 1And we've covered most of the types of animals 1on the Earth in what, 10 minutes? 1Hopefully now you can see 1the resemblance between these guys. 1I love my caterpillar.",science_biology_crash-course-bio-ecology
" -  So let's continue with our conversation around factors of production for a firm, and we're going to focus on the labor market. And so we've already drawn axes like this multiple times, where our horizontal axis, this is the quantity, quantity of labor that's being employed by a firm. And then the vertical axis, this is our wage rate. And so this is, we're looking at the economics for a firm. And we're looking at how much labor is it rational for this firm to employ? And we've talked about the marginal revenue product multiple times. This is a view of how much incremental revenue can the firm get every time it brings on one more labor unit? And we've talked about that we typically see it like a downward-sloping line like this 'cause you have diminishing returns. Every time you add one more labor unit, the marginal revenue product of that labor goes a little bit down, and so that's when you have diminishing returns. So this is marginal revenue products, and I'll be very particular this time. This is of labor. We could do a similar marginal revenue product of other factors like land or capital. Now, to change things up in this video, we're not just going to talk about a firm that operates in a perfectly competitive labor market. If we did, then its marginal factor cost would be whatever the market wage rate would be, and it would be a horizontal line like this. So you would have a marginal factor cost of labor. But we're not going to talk about a firm that's in a perfectly competitive labor market. We're going to talk about a firm that is a monopsony employer, a very fancy word. So it is a monopsony, not a monopoly, a monopsony. Now, what does a monopsony mean? Well, you could almost view it as the reverse of what a monopoly is. A monopoly is you have one seller, so one seller, and many buyers, so many, many buyers. So that is a monopoly, monopoly right over there. A monopsony is when you have one buyer, so one buyer, and many sellers. And so you have many, many sellers. So this right over here is a monopsony firm, monopsony. And in the context that we're talking about, we're talking about labor markets. So this one, instead of saying one buyer, you could say this is one buyer of labor. So you could say one employer, one employer. And the sellers of labors, well, a seller of labor, well, these are many potential, potential workers, potential workers. And there is many real-world examples that approach monopsony employers. Let's say we're in a small town, and there's only one hospital, so they're going to be the monopsony employers of healthcare workers, of, say, nurses. And so what's interesting about a monopsony employer is they're not just going to take whatever the wage rate is, they have to essentially, they have a supply curve for labor in that market. And so, for example, in this market, when wages are low, there's going to be a low supply of labor. Not many people are going to wanna work for that hospital. And then as wages go up, more and more and more people are going to want to work for that monopsony employer. And so this is our labor, labor supply curve. Now, I'm gonna ask you a question. I'm gonna tell you right now, it is a trick question. What is going to be the rational quantity for this firm to hire? Now, you might be tempted to say, well, it's just the same thing. We would just want to keep hiring as long as our marginal revenue product of labor is higher than the cost of labor. And that would be true if you could afford to pay everyone a different rate. If this first unit of labor, you can pay someone this much, and then everyone that you hire, you have to just pay them a little bit more. But that's not the way that it typically works. In the real world, you often think about having to, whatever the wage is, if we decide that this is the quantity of labor that we wanna bring on, you wouldn't pay this wage just to that incremental person, you would have to pay that wage to everyone. And so to think about what is the rational quantity of labor to bring on for this firm, we would need to think, we need to calculate or at least visualize what the marginal factor cost of labor here, which is going to be different than our labor supply curve. And to help us visualize that, let me set up a little table here. So I'm just gonna make up some numbers. So look, we're going to think about the quantity of labor, so let's just go zero, one, two, three, four. And then let's think about the price of labor. And so let's say when the quantity of labor is one, the price of labor is three. And then it goes up as we, if we wanna hire more people, well, the price of labor goes up to four, goes up to five, goes up to six, keeps going. And then what would be the total cost of labor? So total labor cost, well, you could figure that out. If you hire one unit at $3 per unit, one times three is three. Two units at $4 per unit, remember, you're going to have to pay everyone the same amount. So it's not like you can just pay this first person $3 and only the second person $4, in which case, this would be seven. But if you're going to hire two units, you have to pay everyone $4. So your total cost is eight here, two times four. Three time five, your total cost is 15. Your total cost here is 24. And so now we could think about what is our marginal factor cost of labor? So when you bring on that incremental unit of labor, how much incremental cost are you taking on? Well, when you go from one to two units, your total cost goes from three to eight, so your marginal factor cost is five. This is plus five right over here. When you go from two to three, your marginal factor cost, you went from eight to 15. So eight to 15, you went up by seven. And once again, this is because when you wanna hire more people, you're going to have to pay more to track those incremental people, but then you have to pay that higher rate to everyone. And so you see that the marginal factor cost of labor is going up twice as fast as our labor supply curve. Our labor supply curve, every incremental unit, we're adding one. Here, every incremental unit, we're adding two. And we could see it again. To go from 15 to 24, you have to add nine, so our marginal factor cost of labor is nine. And so looking at this as an example, you see that your marginal factor cost of labor is going to go up at twice the slope of your labor supply curve. So your marginal factor cost of labor is going to look something like this. It's going to go up twice as fast, marginal factor cost of labor. And now this might be ringing a bell. This might seem like what we studied in the past when we looked at a monopoly or an imperfect competitor firm. And we talked about the demand for its goods, and we also talked about its marginal revenue. And the marginal revenue curve had twice the negative slope as the demand curve. And here, we see everything just flipped over. Because we're now not talking about revenue for the firm and marginal revenue for the firm, we are talking about costs for the firm. These are inputs for the firm. But now what would be the rational wage rate? And what's the rational quantity of labor for this firm? Well, now that we've done the marginal analysis, we would see that it's rational for the firm to keep bringing on more and more people as long as the marginal revenue product of labor for each incremental unit is higher than the marginal factor cost of labor for each incremental unit. And so we'd keep hiring until you get to this point right over here. So it would be rational for it to bring on this quantity of labor. And what would be the wage that it would pay? Well, you might be tempted to just go right over here and say it would pay this wage, but remember it doesn't have to pay this wage. At this quantity of labor, the labor supply curve tells us that the market wage would be right over here. So it would be paying, it would be paying this wage. It would be paying this wage right over here. So this is something for you to maybe ponder on a little bit more. But the big picture is, is when we're dealing with a monopsony firm, so it is the only person hiring in the market or something that's approaching a monopsony firm, it's going to have its own labor supply curve. And the way you think about what a rational quantity for it to hire is, you would think about the marginal factor cost of labor, which is going to go up at twice the slope. And where that intersects the marginal revenue product, well, that tells you the quantity, and then the labor supply curve will tell you the wage for that quantity.",economics-finance-domain_ap-microeconomics_factor-markets
" Let's say you're me, and you're in math class, and you're supposed to be learning about factoring. Trouble is, your teacher is too busy trying to convince you that factoring is a useful skill for the average person to know, with real-world applications ranging from passing your state exams all the way to getting a higher SAT score. And unfortunately, does not have the time to show you why factoring is actually interesting. It's perfectly reasonable for you to get bored in this situation. So like any reasonable person, you start doodling. Maybe it's because your teacher's soporific voice reminds you of a lullaby, but you're drawing stars. And because you're me, you quickly get bored of the usual five-pointed star and get to wondering, why five? So you start exploring. It seems obvious that a five-pointed star is the simplest one, the one that takes the least number of strokes to draw. Sure, you can make a start with four points, but that's not really a star the way you're defining stars. Then there's a six-pointed star, which is also pretty familiar, but totally different from the five-pointed star because it takes two separate lines to make. And then you're thinking about how, much like you can put two triangles together to make a six-pointed star, you can put two squares together to make an eight-pointed star. And any even-numbered star with p points can be made out of two p/2-gons. It is at this point that you realize that if you wanted to avoid thinking about factoring, maybe drawing stars was not the greatest idea. But wait, four would be an even number of points, but that would mean you could make it out of two 2-gons. Maybe you were taught polygons with only two sides can't exist. But for the purposes of drawing stars, it works out rather well. Sure, the four-pointed star doesn't look too star-like. But then you realize you can make the six-pointed star out of three of these things, and you've got an asterisk, which is definitely a legitimate star. In fact, for any star where the number of points is divisible by 2, you can draw it asterisk style. But that's not quite what you're looking for. What you want is a doodle game, and here it is. Draw p points in a circle, evenly spaced. Pick a number Q. Starting at one point, go around the circle and connect to the point two places over. Repeat. If you get to the starting place before you've covered all the points, jump to a lonely point, and keep going. That's how you draw stars. And it's a successful game, in that previously you were considering running screaming from the room. Or the window was open, so that's an option, too. But now, you're not only entertained but beginning to become curious about the nature of this game. The interesting thing is that the more points you have, the more different ways there is to draw the star. I happen to like seven-pointed stars because there's two really good ways to draw them, but they're still simple. I would like to note here that I've never actually left a math class by the window, not that I can say the same for other subjects. Eight is interesting, too, because not only are there a couple nice ways to draw it, but one's a composite of two polygons, while another can be drawn without picking up the pencil. Then there's nine, which, in addition to a couple of other nice versions, you can make out of three triangles. And because you're me, and you're a nerd, and you like to amuse yourself, you decide to call this kind of star a square star because that's kind of a funny name. So you start drawing other square stars. Four 4-gons, two 2-gons, even the completely degenerate case of one 1-gon. Unfortunately, five pentagons is already difficult to discern. And beyond that, it's very hard to see and appreciate the structure of square stars. So you get bored and move on to 10 dots in a circle, which is interesting because this is the first number where you can make a star as a composite of smaller stars-- that is, two boring old five-pointed stars. Unless you count asterisk stars, in which case 8 was two 4s's or four 2's or two 2's and a 4. But 10 is interesting because you can make it as a composite in more than one way because it's divisible by 5, which itself can be made in two ways. Then there's 11, which can't be made out of separate parts at all because 11 is prime. Though here you start to wonder how to predict how many times around the circle we'll go before getting back to start. But instead of exploring the exciting world of modular arithmetic, you move on to 12, which is a really cool number because it has a whole bunch of factors. And then something starts to bother you. Is a 25-pointed star composite made of five five-pointed stars a square star? You had been thinking only of pentagons because the lower numbers didn't have this question. How could you have missed that? Maybe your teacher said something interesting about prime numbers, and you accidentally lost focus for a moment. I don't know. It gets even worse. 6 squared would be a 36-pointed star made of six hexagons. But if you allow use of six-pointed stars, then it's the same as a composite of 12 triangles. And that doesn't seem in keeping with the spirit of square stars. You'll have to define square stars more strictly. But you do like the idea that there's three ways to make the seventh square star. Anyway, the whole theory of what kind of stars can be made with what numbers is quite interesting. And I encourage you to explore this during your math class.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_vi-hart
" -  I wanna talk a little bit about carbon and how it cycles through our biosphere. And we touch on this in other videos. But when we talk about elements like carbon, they don't just appear and disappear all of a sudden in our biosphere. For the most part, they have been here since the beginning. But they just get recycled from one form to another. And that is also true of carbon. And to appreciate carbon's importance in our biosphere, and especially to life, I have some, some important molecules, or examples of important molecules that involve carbon. In all of these, the carbons are these dark gray colors. So this right over here, this molecule, this is glucose. Glucose, simple sugar. It's where we can derive a lot of our energy from. This is ATP, you can view it as a more immediate store of energy in biological systems. This right over here is one of many amino acids. The amino acids make up our proteins. This right over here is DNA. And in all of these you can see the role that carbon is playing. In fact, sometimes the carbon's hard to see because it's closer to the center of these molecules because the carbon, for the most part, forms the backbone. Because carbon's this really neat, this really neat element, this really neat atom that can make four bonds. It can make these really really really cool structures. But the question is how does carbon cycle through our biosphere? And we can get as simple or as complex as we want to when we discuss this. But on very very simple terms, this is how my brain tends to think about the carbon cycle. You can imagine the carbon in our atmosphere that's mainly in the form of molecular carbon dioxide. So this right over here, this is CO two. Once again, the carbon is in the middle there, bonded to the two oxygens. And as much as we talk about CO two, and as important as carbon is to living systems. In fact, our bodies are 18 to 19 percent carbon carbon by mass. So it's very important for biological systems. As important as carbon is to biological systems, and the role carbon dioxide plays in things like global warming, it actually makes up a very small percentage of our atmosphere. It's only about 0.04 percent of the gas in our atmosphere. Most of our atmosphere is actually nitrogen, 78 percent, you don't talk a lot about it. And oxygen, 21 percent. And then a bunch of other, a bunch of other elements and molecules. But the very simple version of the carbon cycle is, okay, you have this atmospheric carbon dioxide, molecular carbon dioxide, hanging out in the air. And you have autotrophs like plants. So let's say this is the ground, and I have a growing plant. So that's a plant right over there. That's its leaf, that's another leaf. And the way that plants grow is they're able to take light energy. So that's energy coming in from the sun, and use that energy to fix carbon. Now fixing carbon sounds like a very fancy thing, but it's literally taking that molecular carbon dioxide out of the air and fixing the carbon from it to form these different molecules in the plant, that help the plant, that give the plant structure, that give the plant energy. And so that mass of that plant, I'm actually in this room I'm in, there's a houseplant right next to me, it's not just growing out of, I mean, I guess you could say it's growing out of thin air, but the mass isn't just magically appearing. It's taking that mass out of the air. And so that's where, so that's what allows this plant to keep growing. And so, once again, as I said, some of that will be in the form of proteins, amino acids, it could form structural components. It could be fats, and also some of it is energy. And you could imagine other animals that can't do this, that can't photosynthesize, well, they might wanna eat these plants for that energy. In other videos, we talk about the food cycle. And so, this could be me. This could be me having a salad, and I might want to eat that plant. I might wanna eat the plant for the sugar in it. Maybe it's an apple of some kind, and then that gives my body the energy to live and grow. And as I, as I metabolize that glucose, so for example glucose is one of the molecules that that plant can form by taking that carbon out of the air. And then I might metabolize that glucose from that plant I just ate, and as I do that, I will release carbon dioxide. So I will release the CO two back in the air. And then you can see that you can form a cycle here. The CO two gets released by things that are metabolizing these organic molecules, and then it can get fixed again by autotrophs, which are able to store the energy from the sun with, in terms of these bonds, by fixing this carbon. But there's other pathways that we can have to have these cycles. For example, some of the CO two, it could be absorbed into the ocean. It could be absorbed into, into the ocean. And in the ocean it can form carbonate, and so once again you still see the carbon right over there, carbon bonded to three oxygens, and calcium carbonate is a key constituent in things like seashells. And over time, as the sea shells break down, and they get ground up, and they get impacted with pressure, they can form, they can form limestone. So this right over here is limestone. Limestone. But once again, it was formed from carbon dioxide being absorbed into the ocean, living things using that calcium, using that calcium carbonate, the carbonate in conjunction with calcium, in order to form these shells, which get ground down, and it actually forms these rock structures. You can have situations, you can have situations where living things, whether we're talking about the autotrophs like plants, or we're talking about things like me that are eating the plants, well, once they die and there's all this organic matter that hasn't been broken down yet. Well, it gets buried in the ground. I'll do the plant because it's less morbid than showing me dead. So let's say this is the plant. Well, with enough pressure and time. Sometimes in the decomposing process, some of the carbon might be released. But over time this might be compressed and be turned into fossil fuels. So when you see oil or when you are burning gasoline, which is really just a refined part of the oil, it is really this organic matter that was, that's storing energy that plants were able to store from light energy, possibly millions or tens of millions of years ago. But then if you were to take that same, if you were to take that fossil fuel out of the ground, which we now do very actively in order to power all of the things that we need to power, and you were to burn it. So let me see, if I were to. Let me just draw an example of that. So let's say you just had, if you had a canister of oil. I'm not gonna do the oil in black because you'd have trouble seeing it. And if you were to burn it. If you were to burn it, the process of, the process of combustion. And this is in general, if you're burning anything, it doesn't just have to be oil. It could be burning a piece of wood. You're taking that organic matter, those carbon-carbon bonds, and in some ways you can say you're doing the reverse of the photosynthesis process. You're breaking it down, and in that process, you're releasing that carbon, and it's getting released in the form of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide, which in theory could then be fixed once again. So the general idea, autotrophs like plants, when they photosynthesize, they can fix that carbon. And then it could either be burnt, and a combustion process can release that carbon back into the atmosphere, or you could have other animals eating that plant. And then, as they metabolize, as they break these carbon-carbon bonds to power themselves or just do whatever they need to do, that also can release carbon dioxide.",science_biology_ecology
" -  In this video, we're gonna build on what we already know about aggregate demand and aggregate supply, and the Phillips curve, and we are going to connect these ideas. So first, the Phillips curve. This is a typical Phillips curve for an economy. High inflation is associated with low unemployment, high unemployment is associated with low inflation, but we can really view this curve as the short run Phillips curve. Short run Phillips curve. We might sit at different points on this curve at different points in an economic cycle, but we could also introduce an idea known as a long run Phillips curve, which is just based on the natural rate of unemployment for this economy. So let's say the natural rate of unemployment for this economy is 6%. So, then our long run Phillips curve would just be a vertical line right over there. Long run Phillips curve. Now why is it a vertical line? Well it says in the long run, our natural rate of unemployment is 6% regardless of what the inflation rate might be. And so if we are sitting at the intersection of these two curves, that means that our economy right in this moment in time is operating at full employment. If unemployment was lower than that, it would be overheating to some degree, and if unemployment were higher than that, then we would have a negative output gap. But how do we tie these ideas to aggregate demand and aggregate supply? Well let's draw our long run aggregate supply curve, and I'm gonna do it right at the intersection of our aggregate demand and short run aggregate supply curve for now, because I wanna show an economy that's operating at its full potential. So here, this is our long run aggregate supply, and once again it's a vertical line because in the long run, regardless of the price level, we have a certain output for this economy that is sustainable. So that is our full employment. I'll do F, period, E, period. That's our full employment output. Anything more than that, it's unsustainable based on where the economy is structurally right now, and anything less than that, is you have a negative output gap. But now let's think about what would happen if we start shifting curves around. What if we were to have a negative demand shock? So our aggregate demand curve shifts to the left. Well in that world, and this is all a review, you can see that your equilibrium price, so I'm gonna call this aggregate demand sub two, our price level two, and our new equilibrium output for our economy sub two. You can see that both are lower. We now have a negative output gap. But what would that correspond to here on our Phillips curves? Well, when you have a negative output gap, you're likely to have higher unemployment. And shifts in aggregate in the aggregate demand curve would be movements along the short run Phillips curve. So we're gonna move along the short run Phillips curve, and we're going to have higher unemployment, 'cause we have a negative output gap. So we might get to that point right over there. So I'll just call that point sub two. So we went from a situation where before, we had 6% unemployment, and let's say we had 3% inflation, to a world where maybe now, we have, I don't know, let's call it 9% unemployment, and now we have 2% inflation. And it could go the other way around. Let's say we were starting from our original aggregate demand curve and you have a positive demand shock, and so now you could go to this curve, aggregate demand three, and so here, our equilibrium price level is higher. It's called P sub three. And our equilibrium output, we have a positive output gap, so Y sub three. And that would correspond to, if we have a positive output gap, that means we have very low unemployment, maybe unsustainably low unemployment. So we might be right over here. So this might be a situation where our unemployment rate, let's say that's about, I don't know, 4%. And now our inflation, this might be, let's call that 4% as well. And something interesting happens as you start to have higher and higher inflation. That can lead to people just having higher expectations for price and higher expectations for inflation itself. And if folks have higher expectations for inflation, well then they might wanna charge more for a certain level of output. So let's say at this level of output, people might want to have a higher price level. At this level of output, people might wanna have a higher level price, a higher price level. And so it could actually shift our short run aggregate supply up, or you could say to the left. So short run aggregate supply, I'll call that sub three. Now when the short run aggregate supply gets shifted to the left in this situation, notice we're back to our full employment output, but our price level is now much higher. Now what would that correspond to over here? Well when you have a shift in short run aggregate supply curves, that would actually lead to a shift in your short run Phillips curve, but which way would it shift? Well another way to think about it is, at a given, just as at a given level of output you would've expected a higher price because of this increased inflation expectations, so here, at a given level of unemployment, you would expect a higher level of inflation. So, our curve, you would say shifts up or to the right. So we would then have a short run Phillips curve that looks like this. I'll call that sub three. And we might get back to this point. Well for sure if were at this full employment output, then we are operating in our natural rate of unemployment again, but notice, now our inflation has crept even higher. This might be 5% inflation. Now the last thing you might be wondering about is when do these long run curves ever shift? Well we've talked about it before when we talked about long run aggregate supply, and that shifts if the economy structurally changes somehow. Let's say our factories get bombed out in a war or something, then this should shift to the left. And if we got better technology, or better ways of organizing ourselves, or more resources, this might shift to the right. Similarly, if there's a massive shift in global trade, and maybe our workers' skills aren't as valuable anymore in the global economy, this long run Phillips curve might shift to the right. If all of a sudden we are able to, or over time, we're able to get people more skilled, maybe we get frictional unemployment down because we have better technology to place people, well that might shift this to the left.",economics-finance-domain_macroeconomics_macro-long-run-consequences-of-stabilization-policies
" -  So in the last video, I introduced this multi-variable chain rule and here I want to explain a loose intuition for why it's true, why you would expect something like this to happen. So the way you think about an expression like this, you have this multi-variable function f of xy and you're plugging things in, but just that function itself, you'll be thinking of taking a two dimensional space you know here's our xy plane, and then mapping it to, you know, just a real number line and I'll think of this as f, as the output. So somehow our whole function takes things from this two dimensional space and plugs it onto this output. T you're thinking of just another number line up here, so t, and then you've got separate functions here, you know x of t and y of t. X of t and y of t. Each of which take that same value for a specific input, you know it's not that they're acting on different inputs, x of some other input t and y of some other input, it's the same one and then they move that somewhere to this output space which itself get's moved over. And in this way you're thinking of it as just a single variable function that goes from t and ultimately outputs f it's just that there's multi-dimensional stuff happening in between and now if we start thinking about the derivative of it - what does that mean, what does that mean for the conception of the picture that we have going on here? Well, that bottom part, that dt you're thinking of as a tiny change to t, right? So you're thinking of it as kind of a nudge, I'll draw it as a sizable line here for like moving from some original input over, but you might in principal think of it as a very, very tiny nudge in t. And over here you'd say well, that's gonna move your intermediary output in the xy plane to, you know maybe it'll move it in some amount, again imagine this is a very small nudge, I'm going to give it some size here just so I can write into it and then whatever that nudge in the output space right, it's a nudge in some direction that's going to correspond to some change in f. Some change based on the differential properties of the multi-variable function itself. And if we think about this, this change you might break it into components and say this shift here has some kind of dx, some kind of shift in the x direction and some kind of dy, some shift in the y direction. But you can actually reason about what these should be coz it's not just an arbitrary change in x or an arbitrary change in y, it's the one that was caused by dt. So if I go over here, I might say that dx is caused by that dt and the whole meaning of the derivative, the whole meaning of the single variable derivative would be that when we take dx dt, this is the factor that tells us, you know, a tiny nudge in t, how much does that change the x component and if you want you could think of this as kind of cancelling out the dts and you're just left with x, but really you're saying there's a tiny nudge in t and that results in a change in x and this derivative is what tells you the ratio between those sizes. And similarly, that change in y here, that change in y is gonna be somehow proportional to the change in t and that proportion is given by the derivative of y with respect to t that's the whole point of the derivative, no no, with respect to t and again you can kind of think of it as if you're cancelling out the ts and this is why the fractional writing, this Leibniz notation is actually pretty helpful. You know, people will say, oh mathematicians would like, share their heads at the idea of treating these like fractions, but not only is it a useful thing to do coz it is a helpful mnemonic, it's reflective of what you're gonna do when you make a very formal argument. And I think I'll do that in one of the following videos, I'll describe this in a very, a much more formal way that's a little bit more airtight than the kind of hand-waving nudging around. But the intuition you get from just writing this is a fraction is basically the scaffolding for that formal argument, so it's a fine thing to do, I don't think mathematicians are shaking their heads every time that a student or a teacher does this. But anyway, so this is kind of gives you what that dx is, what that dy is and then over here if you're saying how much does that change the ultimate output of the f? You could say, well, your nudge of size dx over here, you're wondering how much that changes the output of f, that's the meaning of the partial derivative, right. If we say we have the partial derivative with respect to x, what that means, is that if you take a tiny nudge of size x this is giving you the ratio between that and the ultimate change to the output that you want. You could think of it like this partial x is cancelling out with that dx if you wanted or you could just say, this is a tiny nudge in x, this is going to result in some change in f - I'm not sure what - but the meaning of the derivative is the ratio between those two and that's what lets you figure it out. And similarly, you might call this the change in f caused by x, like, due to x. Due to, I should say to dx. But that's not the only thing changing the value of f right? That's not the only change happening in the input space, you also have another change in f and this one I might say is due to dy. Due to that tiny shift in y and what that's gonna be we know it's going to be proportional to that tiny shift in y and the proportionality constant - this is the meaning of the partial derivative, that when you nudge y in some way it results in some kind of nudge in f and the ratio between those two is what the derivative gives. So ultimately, if you put this all together what you'd say is there's two different things causing an ultimate change to f. So if you put these together, and you want to know what the total change in f is - so I might go over here and say the total change in f, one of them is caused by partial f, partial x - and I can multiply it by dx here, but really, we know that dx, the change there was in turn caused by dt so that in turn is caused by the change in the x component that was due to dt. That was of course of size dt. And then for similar reasons, the other way that this changes in the y direction is a partial of f with respect to y but what caused that initial shift in y, you'd say that was a shift in y that was due to t, and that size is dy dt times dt, you could think of it. So slight nudge in t causes a change in y, that change in y causes the change in f and when you add those two together that's everything that's going on, that's everything that influences the ultimate change in f. So then if you take this whole expression and you divide everything out by dt so you know, kind of erase it from this side and put it over here, dt, this is your multi-variable chain rule, and of course I've just written the same thing again but hopefully this gives a little bit on intuition for how you're composing different nudges and why you wanna think about it that way. Of course, you can see this, and you see the partial f kind of cancels out with that dx and this partial y kind of cancels out with that dy and you're left with the two different things that constitute a change in x, you know this one is only partially the change in f, this is also partially the change in f, but together they give the ultimate change in f and I think that gives a very strong reason, if you break it down like that, why this should be true.",math_multivariable-calculus_multivariable-derivatives
" -  We know that atherosclerosis is the main contributor to coronary artery disease, and in the coronary arteries, atherosclerosis will cause build-up of these fatty cholesterol-filled plaques, like so. You can see me drawing them in here, and they're occurring all over the coronary arteries so what they do is they sort of obstruct blood flow down the length of the coronary arteries and through all the branches of the coronary arteries because they're just these big bulges of fat that are in the way. So how do they develop? What exactly is this process of atherosclerosis? Well, let me show you what this looks like in a snapshot before we actually look at the mechanisms. I'll take this piece of coronary artery here, let's say this piece right there, and we'll blow that up. If we look at that ... When it's nice and healthy, it's going to look like this. Here's our healthy blood vessel. Nothing built up inside. You can see blood is going to flow through this way. This here is a cross-section of the artery. So as far as we can tell, blood can flow smoothly and nicely through this blood vessel, no obstruction, everything looks good, but when you start getting atherosclerosis happening, things can get a little bit different. When you start getting atherosclerosis happening, your coronary artery might start to look something like this. Immediately, we can see that there's a pretty big difference between the first vessel here, the nice clean one, and the second vessel here, the atherosclerotic, sort of fatty plaque vessel here. All of this yellow stuff is some gross fatty plaque that's been deposited into the vessel wall. If we look at the cross-section here, we can see that it's really doing a number on the amount of blood that's able to flow through this vessel. If we're blood here in red, we can't actually get through this vessel quite as much as we could through here. Look how much room we had in this one. Because of all this build-up, this is why we're going to get downstream symptoms. How, exactly, does this happen? Well, let's redraw our own arteries so we can go through it step by step. Here's our blood vessel there. Now I'm drawing the three layers of the wall of the blood vessels. On the very inside of the blood vessel, as part of this pink layer here, we have a single layer of cells called the endothelium. Let me just draw out the endothelium here. Although it's just a single layer of cells thick, the endothelium has a lot of really important roles. One of its really important jobs is to act as a barrier. It acts as a barrier between stuff that's in the blood and the rest of the blood vessel wall so stuff can't just pass through and get into the rest of the blood vessel wall. This barrier function will become pretty relevant in a minute. You'll just have to take my word for it for now. Another really important job that the endothelium has is to secrete proteins onto its surface that prevent clotting. That keeps blood flowing nice and smoothly. Those are two of its major jobs. It has a couple more, but those are the ones that are relevant in atherosclerosis. All right, so you remember that big fatty vessel from before? Well, how do we get from this, our nice clean blood vessel, how do we get from this to that? Let's take a look. The first thing that has to happen is that there has to be some irritant present, something in the blood that's going to predispose this atherosclerosis to happen. So, what are some irritants? Things like too many lipids, so, specifically, fats and cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, the bad cholesterol. Let's actually put some of this cholesterol in the blood vessel so we can see it really clearly. I'll just label it LDL, LDL-C, actually, so you know this is cholestero, LDL-C. Another irritant, probably the worst one, is toxins from cigarette smoking. So we'll put some toxins in the blood from cigarette smoking. We'll do them in gray here. Another major one is just hypertension, high blood pressure. We'll try to show that pathologically high blood pressure here by these arrows. High blood pressure. This means high blood pressure. I'll actually write hypertension here, because I just want to make it clear that it's the chronic exposure to high blood pressure, it's not just high blood pressure every once-in-a-while. That's our first step, to have an irritant present. Our second step is to actually have damage to the endothelium by the irritant. So our barrier, now, is broken down. It's started to break down. That's step two. That's actual damage of the endothelium. In step three, regardless of whatever damaged the endothelium, I mean, if it was toxins or if it was the cholesterol or if it was the high blood pressure, regardless of what actually damaged the endothelium, what happens next is that the cholesterol will jump in there and start to collect under the damaged endothelium. Let me actually clear away some of this because we're going to focus on the cholesterol now. This is cholesterol and it's going to sort of settle in here. It's going to think to itself, hey, that looks pretty comfy. That looks like a cozy place to be, so I'm going to just jump in there, and, of course, these are coming from inside the blood. They're not just sort of multiplying. They're floating around in the blood and then when they come across this damaged endothelium, they're going to join their friends. When they build up to this sort of flattened extent here, they're known as a fatty streak. One thing that happens to the cholesterol when they get inside the wall of the blood vessel there is that they start to get oxidized. They sort of change a little bit. When they change, when they get oxidized, that sends a signal to the immune system, to our body's immune system, and that signal will bring around these cells of the immune system called monocytes. They'll sort of show up, almost like police. Here's a monocyte here. I'll draw it in white to remind you that it's a white blood cell. This monocyte doesn't really like that the cholesterol is starting to collect in the blood vessel wall, so the monocyte will actually chase in after the cholesterol to try to break up the little party that they're having. I'll actually draw what happens next down in this next bit of the blood vessel down here, just so we can keep in mind all of the past events. You may have noticed that I drew this white blood cell to look like a Pac-Man sort of thing, eating up this cholesterol because that's essentially what it does. Once it gets into the endothelium, it converts into something called the macrophage, macro meaning big and phage meaning to eat. So it's really this big eater. It's job here is to devour that LDL cholesterol that's collected in the endothelium. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned for our macrophage, because what ends up happening is it starts to gorge itself. The macrophage eats so much cholesterol that it just sort of becomes too full of these yellow cholesterol drops and it sort of dies off, but it's full of cholesterol. Someone a long time ago looked down a microscope and thought that these dead macrophages filled with cholesterol looked like foam, like sea foam that you see at the beach, so these dead macrophages filled with cholesterol are now called foam cells. Let's catch our list up. Remember, these foam cells were actually white blood cells, so when they die they release these signals that sort of call in reinforcements. I'm going to use that to remind you that atherosclerosis is primarily an inflammatory disease, it's an inflammatory condition. When these foam cells release their cytokines, their signals, they call in reinforcements, and the whole process sort of proceeds in this viscous cycle, as you'll see. Don't forget that LDL is also still being deposited into the wall from the blood stream. As part of this inflammation, more and more endothelial cells get damaged, so I'll move our drawing down even further so we can look at the next sort of development. You can see this mountain of cholesterol and foam cells, dead macrophages that are filled with cholesterol. You can see this mountain just keep on building, and keep on building, and bulging out into the middle of the blood vessel. By now, things are just way out of control. These guys in here, this is the smooth muscle part of the artery, by the way, so this is the smooth muscle layer, these guys start to take notice, these smooth muscle cells. What ends up happening is that you get smooth muscle cells that sort of migrate out of the smooth muscle layer, and they sort of migrate. I hope you can see this. I'll draw them a little bit thicker. They start to migrate out of the smooth muscle layer and into the fatty plaque here, because they can sort of sense that something's not quite right. What they start to do is they really want the plaque covered up, because they don't want the thrombogenic -- Remember thrombogenic means clot-forming. They don't want the thrombogenic plaque to be exposed to the blood, so what they start to do is they start to secrete a fibrous cap. They sort of spit out this collagen and elastin protein cap that covers up, I'm drawing it in purple, that covers up this plaque and shields it from the blood stream. That's called a fibrous cap. 1They also do something else. 1These smooth muscle also do something else. 1You remember these foam cells that died in here. 1When they release their signals after they die, 1they induce the smooth muscle into depositing 1calcium into the plaque. 1I'll draw that in. 1I'll draw in these little calcium crystals now, 1so you can see, it's just starting to look 1like a mess in here. 1There's just all sorts of stuff going on. 1Again, this is really not something 1you want to have happening in your body. 1Just by looking at this, 1what can we say is happening to the blood vessel? 1Well, we can see this huge bulge. 1We can see that the plaque is obviously 1bulging into the blood vessel, 1and it's probably going to restrict 1the flow of blood that can get through here. 1That's one thing that atherosclerosis is doing. 1It's occluding, it's blocking off, the arteries. 1The second thing is look at this calcium. 1If there's one thing that we know about calcium 1is that it's really tough, it's really hard. 1By the smooth muscle laying down calcium, 1that's one of the ways that atherosclerosis 1makes your arteries really hard, 1and that's actually part of the name. 1Atherosclerosis actually means 1hardening of your arteries. 1But I think in terms of coronary artery disease, 1the biggest reason that atherosclerosis is bad 1is because it can cause complete blockage of the artery, 1and that blockage of the artery can happen 1because sometimes this plaque, this fatty plaque, 1it can rupture. 1When it ruptures, all this thrombogenic plaque 1material gets exposed to the blood. 1When it gets exposed to the blood, 1it starts to form this really big blood clot 1in the middle of your artery, 1in the middle of one of your coronary arteries. 1Let's just draw that in here. 1Let's just draw this big blood clot. 1Pretend that this has been ruptured, 1and this yellow thrombogenic material has been exposed, 1and this big blood clot's going to form. 1By the way, I'm originally from Jamaica 1and blood clot is a bad word in Jamaica, 1so I apologize to any of my Jamaicans 1who are watching this. 1So this big clot could form, 1and it could totally block off the blood vessel. 1When that happens, no blood can get through, right? 1So this is really the biggest reason 1that we don't want atherosclerosis 1to be happening in our coronary arteries, 1because you can see that we've blocked off 1the blood flow, and if blood isn't allowed 1to get passed this clot and get to the piece 1of the heart that it's supposed to be serving 1within about 20 minutes, then you get 1irreversible damage and death of that piece of heart muscle. 1For example, what we drew is this little piece 1of artery here, in blue. 1So if an atherosclerotic plaque and a clot 1developed right there, as it has in our vessel here, 1then that would be really, really, really bad, 1because all the blood for this whole part of the heart 1is coming from this upstream vessel. 1So without getting blood flow through this vessel 1for about 20 minutes, if this clot persists 1for about 20 minutes, all of this heart muscle 1would start to die off. 1That would be a massive heart attack. 1Actually, let me just clarify. 1We say heart attack, but in medicine we refer 1to a heart attack as a 1myocardial infarct, or an MI. 1Myocardial just refers to heart muscle, 1cardia for heart, and myo for muscle, 1so heart muscle. 1And infarct means death of tissue 1due to lack of oxygen from lack of blood. 1So a myocardial infarct is death of heart muscle 1due to lack of oxygen. 1Here we've had a myocardial infarct 1due to this big plaque that developed here.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system-diseases
" -  Which slope field is generated by the differential equation the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to x minus y? And like always pause this video and see if you can figure it out on your own. Well the easiest way to think about a slope field, if I was, if i needed to plot this slope field by hand, I would sample a bunch of x and y points. And then I would figure out what the derivative would have to be at that point. And so what we can do here, since we've already drawn some candidate slope fields for us, is figure out what we think the slope field should be at some points and see which of these diagrams, these graphs, or these slope fields actually show that. So let's, let me make a little table here, so I'm gonna have, x, y and then the derivative of y with respect to x. And we can do it at a bunch of values, so let's think about it. Let's think about when, we're at this point right over here. When x is two and y is two. When x is two and y is two, the derivative of y with respect to x is going to be two minus two. It's going to be equal to zero. And just with that, let's see, here this slope on this slope field does not look like it's zero. This looks like it's negative one. So already I can rule this one out. This slope right over looks like it's positive one. So I'll rule that out, it's definitely not zero. This slope also looks like positive one. So I can rule that one out. This slope at two comma two actually does look like zero. So I'm liking this one right over here. This slope at two comma two looks larger than one so I can rule that out. So it was that straight forward to deduce that this choice right over here is, if any of these are going to be the accurate slope field, it's this one. But just for kicks we could keep going to verify that this is indeed the slope field. So let's think about what happens when x is equal to a one, whenever x is equal to y, you're gonna get the derivative equaling zero. And you see that here, when you're at four, four, derivative equals zero. When it's six, six, derivative equals zero. At negative two, negative two, derivative equals zero. So that feels good, that this is the right slope field. And then we could pick other arbitrary points. Let's say when x is four, y is two, then the derivative here should be four minus two, which is going to be two. So when x is four, y is two, we do indeed see that the slope field is indicating a slope that looks like two right over here. And if it was the other way around, when x is let's say, x is negative four and y is negative two. The negative four, negative two. Well negative four minus negative two is going to be negative two. And you can see that right over here. Negative four, negative two, you can see the slope right over here. It's a little harder to see, looks like negative two. So once again using even just this first two comma two coordinates we were able to deduce this was the choice. But it just continues to confirm our original answer.",math_calculus-2_cs2-differential-equations
" Let's say I'm trying to judge how many years of experience we have at the Khan Academy. Or on average, how many years of experience we have. And in particular, the particular type of average we'll focus on, is the arithmetic mean. So I go and I survey the folks there. And let's say this was when Khan Academy was a smaller organization, when there were only five people in the organization. And I find-- and I'm surveying the entire population-- so years of experience, the entire population of Khan Academy, because that's what I care about, years of experience at our organization, at Khan Academy. And this was when we had five people. And I were to go-- we're now 36 people, I don't want to date this video too much-- but let's say I go, and I say, OK, there's one person straight out of college, they have one year of experience, or recently out of college, somebody with three years of experience, someone with five years of experience, someone with seven years of experience, and someone very experienced, or reasonably experienced, with 14 years of experience. So based on this data point, and this is our population, for years of experience. I'm assuming that we only have five people in the organization, at this point. What would be the population mean for the years of experience? What is the mean years of experience for my population? Well, we can just calculate that. Our mean experience, and I'm going to denote it with mu, because we're talking about the population now. This is a parameter for the population. It's going to be equal to the sum, from our first data point, so data point one all the way to data point, in this case, data point five-- we have five data points-- of each of-- so we're going to take all, from the first data point, the second data point, the third data point, all the way to the fifth. So this is going to be equal to x1, plus x-- and I'm going to divide it all by the number of data points I have-- plus x2, plus x3, plus x4, plus x sub 5, subscript 5. All of that over 5. And as we said, this is a very fancy way of saying, I'm going to sum up all of these things and then divide by the number of things we have. So let's do that. Get the calculator out. So I'm going to add them all up, 1 plus 3 plus 5-- I really don't need a calculator for this-- plus 7 plus 14. So that's five data points. And I'm going to divide by 5. And I get 6. So the population mean, for years of experience at my organization, is 6. 6 years of experience. Well, that's, I guess, interesting. But now I want to ask another question. I want to get some measure of how much spread there is around that mean. Or how much do the data points vary around that mean. And obviously, I can give someone all the data points. But instead, I actually want to come up with a parameter that somehow represents how much all of these things, on average, are varying from this number right here. Or maybe I will call that thing the variance. And so, what I do-- so the variance-- and I will do-- and this is a population variance that I'm talking about, just to be clear, it's a parameter. The population variance I'm going to denote with the Greek letter sigma, lowercase sigma-- this is capital sigma-- lowercase sigma squared. And I'm going to say, well, I'm going to take the distance from each of these points to the mean. And just so I get a positive value, I'm going to square it. And then, I'm going to divide by the number of data points that I have. So essentially, I'm going to find the average squared distance. Now that might sound very complicated, but let's actually work it out. So I'll take my first data point and I will subtract our mean from it. So this is going to give me a negative number. But if I square it, it's going to be positive. So it's, essentially, going to be the squared distance between 1 and my mean. And then, to that, I'm going to add the squared distance between 3 and my mean. And to that, I'm going to add the squared distance between 5 and my mean. And since I'm squaring, it doesn't matter if I do 5 minus 6, or 6 minus 5. When I square it, I'm going to get a positive result regardless. And then, to that I'm going to add the squared distance between 7 and my mean. So 7 minus 6 squared. All of this, this is my population mean that I'm finding the difference between. And then, finally, the squared difference between 14 and my mean. And then, I'm going to find, essentially, the mean of these squared distances. So I have five squared distances right over here. So let me divide by 5. So what will I get when I make this calculation, right over here? Well, let's figure this out. This is going to be equal to 1 minus 6 is negative 5, negative 5 squared is 25. 3 minus 6 is negative 3, now if I square that, I get 9. 5 minus 6 is negative 1, if I square it, I get positive 1. 7 minus 6 is 1, if I square it, I get positive 1. And 14 minus 6 is 8, if I square it, I get 64. And then, I'm going to divide all of that by 5. And I don't need to use a calculator, but I tend to make a lot of careless mistakes when I do things while making a video. So I get 25 plus 9 plus 1 plus 1 plus 64 divided by 5. So I get 20. So the average squared distance, or the mean squared distance, from our population mean is equal to 20. You may say, wait, these things aren't 20 away. Remember, it's the squared distance away from my population mean. So I squared each of these things. I liked it, because it made it positive. And we'll see later it has other nice properties about it. Now the last thing is, how can we represent this mathematically? We already saw that we know how to represent a population mean, and a sample mean, mathematically like this, and hopefully, we don't find it that daunting anymore. But how would we do the exact same thing? How would we denote what we did, right over here? Well, let's just think it through. We're just saying that the population variance, we're taking the sum of each-- so we're going to take each item, we'll start with the first item. And we're going to go to the n-th item in our population. We're talking about a population here. And we're going to take-- we're not going to just take the item, this would just be the item-- but we're going take the item. And from that, we're going to subtract the population mean. We're going to subtract this thing. We're going to subtract this thing. We're going to square it. We're going to square it. So the way I've written it right now, this would just be the numerator. I've just taken the sum of each of these things, the sum of the difference between each data point and the population mean and squared it. If I really want to get the way I figure out this variance right over here, I have to divide the whole thing by the number of data points we have. So this might seem very daunting, and very intimidating. But all it says is, take each of your data points-- well, one, it says, figure out your population mean. Figure that out first. And then, from each data point, in your population, subtract out that population mean, square it, take the sum of all of those things, and then just divide by the number of data points you have. And you will get your population variance.",math_statistics-probability_summarizing-quantitative-data
" Let's see if we can simplify 5 times the square root of 117. So 117 doesn't jump out at me as some type of a perfect square. So let's actually take its prime factorization and see if any of those prime factors show up more than once. So clearly it's an odd number. It's clearly not divisible by 2. To test whether it's divisible by 3, we can add up all of the digits. And we explain why this works in another place on Khan Academy. But if you add up all the digits, you get a 9. And 9 is divisible by 3, so 117 is going to be divisible by 3. Now, let's do a little aside here to figure out what 117 divided by 3 actually is. So 3 doesn't go into 1. It does go into 11, three times. 3 times 3 is 9. Subtract, you got a remainder of 2. Bring down a 7. 3 goes into 27 nine times. 9 times 3 is 27. Subtract, and you're done. It goes in perfectly. So we can factor 117 as 3 times 39. Now 39, we can factor as-- that jumps out more at us that that's divisible by 3. That's equivalent to 3 times 13. And then all of these are now prime numbers. So we could say that this thing is the same as 5 times the square root of 3 times 3 times 13. And this is going to be the same thing as-- and we know this from our exponent properties-- 5 times the square root of 3 times 3 times the square root of 13. Now, what's the square root of 3 times 3? Well, that's the square root of 9. That's the square root of 3 squared. Any of those-- well, that's just going to give you 3. So this is just going to simplify to 3. So this whole thing is 5 times 3 times the square root of 13. So this part right over here would give us 15 times the square root of 13. Let's do one more example here. So let's try to simplify 3 times the square root of 26. I'm actually going to put 26 in yellow, like I did in the previous problem. Well, 26 is clearly an even number, so it's going to be divisible by 2. We can rewrite it as 2 times 13. And then we're done. 13 is a prime number. We can't factor this any more. And so 26 doesn't have any perfect squares in it. It's not like we can factor it out as a factor of some other numbers and some perfect squares like we did here. 117 is 13 times 9. It's the product of a perfect square and 13. 26 isn't, so we've simplified this about as much as we can. We would just leave this as 3 times the square root of 26.",math_algebra-home_alg-exp-and-log
" Now that we know what an angle is, let's think about how we can measure them. And we already hinted at one way to think about the measure of angle in the last video where we said, look, this angle XYZ seems more open than angle BAC. So maybe the measure of angle XYZ should be larger than the angle of the BAC, and that is exactly the way we think about the measures of angles. But what I want to do in this video is come up with an exact way to measure an angle. So what I've drawn over here is a little bit of a half-circle, and it looks very similar to a tool that you can buy at your local school supplies store to measure angles. So this is actually a little bit of a drawing of a protractor. And what we do in something like a protractor-- you could even construct one with a piece of paper-- is we've taken a half-circle right here, and we've divided it into a 180 sections, and each of these marks marks 10 of those sections. And what you do for any given angle is you put one of the sides of the angle. So each of the rays of an angle are considered one of its sides. So you put the vertex of the angle at the center of this half-circle-- or if you're dealing with an actual protractor, at the center of that protractor-- and then you put one side along the 0 mark. So I'm going redraw this angle right over here at the center of this protractor. So if we said this is Y, then the Z goes right over here. And then the other ray, ray YX in this circumstance, will go roughly in that direction. And so it is pointing on the protractor to the-- let's see. This looks like this is the 70th of section. This is the 80th section. So maybe this is, I would guess, the 77th section. So this is pointing to 77 right over here. Assuming that I drew it the right way right over here, we could say the measure of angle XYZ-- sometimes they'll just say angle XYZ is equal to, but this is a little bit more formal-- the measure of angle XYZ is equal to 77. Each of these little sections, we call them ""degrees."" So it's equal to 77-- sometimes it's written like that, the same way you would write ""degrees"" for the temperature outside. So you could write ""77 degrees"" like that or you could actually write out the word right over there. So each of these sections are degrees, so we're measuring in degrees. And I want to be clear, degrees aren't the only way to measure angles. Really, anything that measures the openness. So when you go into trigonometry, you'll learn that you can measure angles, not only in degrees, but also using something called ""radians."" But I'll leave that to another day. So let's measure this other angle, angle BAC. So once again, I'll put A at the center, and then AC I'll put along the 0 degree edge of this half-circle or of this protractor. And then I'll point AB in the-- well, assuming that I'm drawing it exactly the way that it's over there. Normally, instead of moving the angle, you could actually move the protractor to the angle. So it looks something like that, and you could see that it's pointing to right about the 30 degree mark. So we could say that the measure of angle BAC is equal to 30 degrees. And so you can look just straight up from evaluating these numbers that 77 degrees is clearly larger than 30 degrees, and so it is a larger angle, which makes sense because it is a more open angle. And in general, there's a couple of interesting angles to think about. If you have a 0 degree angle, you actually have something that's just a closed angled. It really is just a ray at that point. As you get larger and larger or as you get more and more open, you eventually get to a point where one of the rays is completely straight up and down while the other one is left to right. So you could imagine an angle that looks like this where one ray goes straight up down like that and the other ray goes straight right and left. Or you could imagine something like an angle that looks like this where, at least, the way you're looking at it, one doesn't look straight up down or one does it look straight right left. But if you rotate it, it would look just like this thing right over here where one is going straight up and down and one is going straight right and left. And you can see from our measure right over here that that gives us a 90 degree angle. It's a very interesting angle. It shows up many, many times in geometry and trigonometry, and there's a special word for a 90 degree angle. It is called a ""right angle."" So this right over here, assuming if you rotate it around, would look just like this. We would call this a ""right angle."" And there is a notation to show that it's a right angle. You draw a little part of a box right over there, and that tells us that this is, if you were to rotate it, exactly up and down while this is going exactly right and left, if you were to rotate it properly, or vice versa. And then, as you go even wider, you get wider and wider and wider and wider until you get all the way to an angle that looks like this. So you could imagine an angle where the two rays in that angle form a line. So let's say this is point X. This is point Y, and this is point Z. You could call this angle ZXY, but it's really so open that it's formed an actual line here. Z, X, and Y are collinear. This is a 180 degree angle where we see the measure of angle ZXY is 180 degrees. And you can actually go beyond that. So if you were to go all the way around the circle so that you would get back to 360 degrees and then you could keep going around and around and around, and you'll start to see a lot more of that when you enter a trigonometry class. Now, there's two last things that I want to introduce in this video. There are special words, and I'll talk about more types of angles in the next video. But if an angle is less than 90 degrees, so, for example, both of these angles that we started our discussion with are less than 90 degrees, we call them ""acute angles."" So this is acute. So that is an acute angle, and that is an acute angle right over here. They are less than 90 degrees. What does a non-acute angle look like? And there's a word for it other than non-acute. Well, it would be more than 90 degrees. So, for example-- let me do this in a color I haven't used-- an angle that looks like this, and let me draw it a little bit better than that. An angle it looks like this. So that's one side of the angle or one of the rays and then I'll put the other one on the baseline right over here. Clearly, this is larger than 90 degrees. If I were to approximate, let's see, that's 100, 110, 120, almost 130. So let's call that maybe a 128-degree angle. We call this an ""obtuse angle."" The way I remember it as acute, it's kind of ""a cute"" angle. It's nice and small. I believe acute in either Latin or Greek or maybe both means something like ""pin"" or ""sharp."" So that's one way to think about it. An acute angle seems much sharper. Obtuse, I kind of imagine something that's kind of lumbering and large. Or you could think it's not acute. It's not nice and small and pointy. So that's one way to think about it, but this is just general terminology for different types of angles. Less than 90 degrees, you have an acute angle. At 90 degrees, you have a right angle. Larger than 90 degrees, you have an obtuse angle. And then, if you get all the way to 180 degrees, your angle actually forms a line.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_imp-geometry-2
" - So let's take a look at a few of the more common events that can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. And maybe let's do that by sort of categorizing them here. So let's draw a line down here and pop ""nature"" down on this end, and ""nurture"" on the other end here. So now we've got a little spectrum that goes from nature all the way to nurture. And you've probably heard these terms before, nature and nurture. And what we mean when we say nature, what we are talking about are things that are innate, things that we are born with. So for example, our DNA, our genetic instructions that we have inside of ourselves that tells our body what to do and what to make. This is part of our nature. And let's actually put DNA down here on the nature side of our spectrum of causes of neurodevelopmental disorders. So we'll just say ""genetics"" here because changes in our DNA, like maybe if our mom or our dad, or maybe both of them, if they pass on mutated genes, well this is one of the possible events that can lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder. Right, and I should actually point out here that we're looking at sort of broad causes of neurodevelopmental disorders kind of in general. We'll look at some specific examples shortly, but right now let's just think broadly just so that we can get a sense of what sorts of overarching causes in general can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders. So on the other end of our spectrum here, when we say nurture, what we're talking about is our environment. All of our personal experiences that happen after we're born. So for example, I recently had an infection called meningitis which is when our meninges, these protective membranes that cover our brain and our spinal cord, they become infected. So, I developed this infection from my environment rather than something that I was born with and we can actually put infections, including meningitis, down here on the nurture end of our spectrum as a possible cause of a neurodevelopmental disorder. So you might be thinking, ""Right, now hold on. ""So if she had meningitis and if infections like meningitis ""can cause neurodevelopmental disorders, does that ""mean that she has a neurodevelopmental disorder?"" And that's actually a really good question and it brings us to a really, really important point. And that's that all of these different events that we're talking about, in order for them to result in a neurodevelopmental disorder, they need to occur during the critical periods of development. So while the fetus is developing during pregcy or during the actual birthing process or maybe shortly after birth, within the first few months to years of life. And that's why we call them neurodevelopmental disorders because when these events occur during these critical periods of development, they disrupt development in some way. So for me, I had meningitis around my mid-20's, so I passed these critical periods of development and my meningitis didn't result in a neurodevelopmental disorder. And let's actually keep this question in the back of our minds because we're going to look at it again shortly when we talk a bit more about this word, ""cause."" So let's jump back here to our spectrum and while we're here looking at nurture, let's pop down something else. Let's pop down trauma. And by trauma, what I'm talking about is something like head trauma, maybe from a car accident or a fall. And we can also put down deprivation. And when I say deprivation, what I mean is something like temporary hearing loss during the first few years of life. Maybe from recurrent ear infections in infancy or toddlerhood. And let's kind of move to the middle of our line here, at the middle of our spectrum, to talk about things that kind of fall in between nature and nurture. So these are things that might happen before a baby is born, so during pregcy, but are due to the environment that the fetus is in. So if we're exposed to certain substances or toxins, maybe if mom drinks alcohol or smokes cigarettes while she's pregt, this can cause certain neurodevelopmental disorders. Or maybe if mom doesn't get all of her important vitamins and minerals. So for example, maybe she doesn't get enough folate, one of our B vitamins, while she's pregt. So these sorts of nutritional deficiencies can also result in a neurodevelopmental disorder because a fetus relies on getting its nutrients, the fuel that it needs to grow properly, from mom. So these are some of the main types of events or conditions that can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. And I promised that we would go over some specific examples and talk more about that term, ""cause."" So let's do that, let's put some examples down of some specific neurodevelopmental disorders. So how about Down syndrome and cerebral palsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder? We'll just put ADHD for that one. We'll use these three disorders in particular because each of them is going to help me demonstrate a particular point that I want to make. And let's actually draw a circle for each of these, and we'll put the causes of these different disorders in these circles here. We'll kind of make what we call a Causal Pie Chart. So if we look at Down syndrome, Down syndrome is caused by extra genetic material from chromosome 21. So let's put that in our Down syndrome circle here. Extra genetic material from chromosome 21. And sorry, why would this even happen? Well, this usually happens because the person has three copies of chromosome 21 rather than two. And you may have heard this being referred to as trisomy 21. ""Tri"" meaning three and ""somy"" referring to chromosome and ""21"" because we're talking about the 21st chromosome. So when someone has this extra genetic material from chromosome 21, they will develop Down syndrome. So we call this type of cause, this extra genetic material a sufficient cause, where sufficient means that every time this happens, so in this case the extra genetic information from chromosome 21, the outcome, Down syndrome, will always follow. So a totally different example of a sufficient cause is if I throw water on you, right? You will definitely get wet. Each time I throw water on you, you'll get wet. So me throwing water on you is a sufficient cause of you getting wet whereas an insufficient cause of you getting wet would be maybe like walking past a sprinkler. It's there, but you may or may not get wet. Now if we come back to Down syndrome here, in order for someone to develop Down syndrome, they must have extra genetic material from chromosome 21. In other words, every person with Down Syndrome has this extra material from chromosome 21. So because of this, because this is a requirement for the development of Down syndrome, we also call this a necessary cause. Necessary meaning that we need this to happen in order for our event, Down syndrome to occur. So extra genetic material from chromosome 21 is both a sufficient and a necessary cause of Down syndrome. Sufficient because it alone will always cause Down syndrome, and necessary because you can't have Down syndrome without extra genetic information from chromosome 21. So with these definitions in mind, let's check out cerebral palsy next. Well, there are actually quite a few different events that can each result in cerebral palsy. Let's draw another pie chart here and let's say that each of these represents a different person with cerebral palsy. And we could potentially draw 100 more circles here to write down all of the causes of cerebral palsy. But I'm just going to use two examples for now. So in this first one here, one cause of cerebral palsy is trauma. So maybe this person was in a car accident when they were just a few months old. And let's make our other example here an infection. So maybe this person had an infection like meningitis a few days after they were born. Now this brings us back to that thought that I wanted you to hold on to when we were wondering why I don't have a neurodevelopmental disorder even though I've had meningitis. Because that question leads us really nicely into how we can use the word ""cause"" in different ways. So while both of these people here have cerebral palsy because of these events like trauma or infection, these events don't always cause cerebral palsy. So because they don't always cause cerebral palsy, these are insufficient causes, right? They are the sprinkler. And let's see if any of these events are necessary causes. In other words, does cerebral palsy require one of these events? Well this person here, they developed cerebral palsy but they never had an infection, like meningitis so meningitis isn't a necessary cause, right? We don't need meningitis in order for cerebral palsy to occur. And this person, they developed cerebral palsy but they haven't sustained any head trauma so head trauma can't be a necessary cause either. So none of the causes of cerebral palsy are necessary causes, right? Remember our example where I caused you to get wet because I threw water at you? Well there are other ways I could get you wet, right? I could spray you with a hose or push you into a pool. Both of these will leave you pretty soaked as well. So me throwing water at you isn't a necessary cause of you getting wet because I can accomplish my goal of soaking you without it. And it's the same kind of idea for these different causes of cerebral palsy here. For both of these people, these events for them have caused cerebral palsy, but remember that there are lots of potential causes of cerebral palsy. So infection or trauma aren't necessary causes of cerebral palsy. So let's look at ADHD. And with ADHD, well we haven't quite figured out all of the details behind the causes of ADHD but we have discovered some events that increase a person's chance of developing ADHD. So we think that these events sort of come together and form a sufficient cause of ADHD. So let's make up an example of what this might look like. So maybe for this person, ADHD runs in the family. Maybe mom or dad have ADHD themselves. So let's put genetic predisposition down here as one wedge in our pie chart. And maybe mom smoked while she was pregt with our kid here with ADHD. So let's put maternal cigarette exposure here as another wedge. And let's make our last wedge exposure to toxins, 1maybe something like exposure to lead from old school 1lead paint while the person was a young kid. 1Maybe he used to eat paint chips from his bedroom 1wall when he was little. 1I know at least one person who's done this. 1So we know that these events increase the chance 1of ADHD developing, but alone might not be sufficient 1enough to cause ADHD. 1But if we combine them together like we have here, 1we think that the combination might be enough, 1making them together a sufficient cause of ADHD. 1And none of these individual events is 1a necessary cause of ADHD. 1Because not everyone with ADHD has a genetic 1predisposition or was exposed to lead or cigarette toxins. 1So we don't need any one of these individual events 1in order for ADHD to develop.",science_health-and-medicine_mental-health
" In the last video, we began to explore Stokes' theorem. And what I want to do in this video is to see whether it's consistent with some of what we have already seen. And to do that, let's imagine-- so let me draw my axes. So that's my z-axis. That is my x-axis. And then that is my y-axis. And now let's imagine a region in the xy plane. So let me draw it like this. So let's say this is my region in the xy plane. I will call that region R. And I also have a boundary of that region. And let's say we care about the direction that we traverse the boundary. And let's say we're going to traverse it in a counterclockwise direction. So we have this path that goes around this region. We can call that c. So we'll call that c, and we're going to traverse it in the counterclockwise direction. And let's say that we also have a vector field f. That essentially its i component is just going to be a function of x and y. And its j component is only going to be a function of x and y. And let's say it has no k component. So the vector field on this region, it might look something like this. I'm just drawing random things. And then if you go off that region, if you go in the z direction, it's just going to look the same as you go higher and higher. So that vector, it wouldn't change as you change your z component. And all of the vectors would essentially be parallel to, or if z is 0, actually sitting on the xy plane. Now given this, let's think about what Stokes' theorem would tell us about the value of the line integral over the contour-- let me draw that a little bit neater-- the line integral over the contour c of f dot dr, f dot lowercase dr, Where dr is obviously going along the contour. So if we take Stokes' theorem, then this quantity right over here should be equal to this quantity right over here. It should be equal to the double integral over the surface. Well this region is really just a surface that's sitting in the xy plane. So it should really just be the double integral-- let me write that in that same-- it'll be the double integral over our region, which is really just the same thing as our surface, of the curl of f dot n. So let's just think about what the curl of f dot n is. And then d of s would just be a little chunk of our region, a little chunk of our flattened surface right over there. So instead of ds, I'll just write da. But let's think of what curl of f dot n would actually be. So let's work on curl of f first. So the curl of f-- and the way I always remember it is we're going to take the determit of this ijk partial with respect to x, partial with respect to y, partial with respect to z. This is just the definition of taking the curl. We're figuring out how much this vector field would cause something to spin. And then we want the i component, which is our function p, which is just a function of x and y, j component, which is just the function q. And there was no z component over here, so 0. And so this is going to be equal to-- well if we look at the i component, it's going to be the partial of y of 0. That's just going to be 0, minus the partial of q with respect to z. Well what's the partial of q with respect to z? Well q isn't a function of z at all. So that's also going to be 0-- let me write this out just so it's not too confusing. So our i component, it's going to be partial of 0 with respect to y. Well that's just going to be 0 minus the partial of q with respect to z. Well the partial of q with respect to z is just going to be 0. So we have a 0 i component. And then we want to subtract the j component. And then the j component partial of 0 with respect to x is 0. And then from that you're going to subtract the partial of p with respect to z. Well once again, p is not a function of z at all. So that's going to be 0 again. And then you have plus k times the partial of q with respect to x. Remember this is just the partial derivative operator. So the partial of q with respect to x. And from that we're going to subtract the partial of p with respect to y. So the curl of f just simplifies to this right over here. Now what is n? What is the unit normal vector. Well we're in the xy plane. So the unit normal vector is just going to be straight up in the z direction. It's going to have a magnitude of 1. So in this case, our unit normal vector is just going to be the k vector. So we're essentially just going to take-- so curl of f is this. And our unit normal vector is just going to be equal to the k. It's just going to be the k unit vector. It's going to go straight up. So what happens if we take the curl of f dot k? If we just dot this with k. We're just dotting this with this. Well, we're just going to end up with this part right over here. So curl of f dot the unit normal vector is just going to be equal to this business. It's just going to be equal to the partial of q with respect to x minus the partial of p with respect to y. And this is neat because using Stokes' theorem in the special case, where we're dealing with a flattened-out surface in the xy plane, in this situation, this just boiled down to Green's theorem. This thing right over here just boiled down to Green's theorem. So we see that Green's theorem is really just a special case-- let me write theorem a little bit neater. We see that Green's theorem is really just a special case of Stokes' theorem, where our surface is flattened out, and it's in the xy plane. So that should make us feel pretty good, although we still have not proven Stokes' theorem. But the one thing that I do like about this is seeing that Green's theorem and Stokes' theorem is consistent is now it starts to make sense of this right over here. When we first learned Green's theorem, we were like, what is this? what's going on over here? But now this is telling us this is just taking the curl in this region along this surface. And now starts to make a lot of sense based on the intuition that we saw in the last video.",math_multivariable-calculus_greens-theorem-and-stokes-theorem
" -  What we are going to do in this video is talk about the idea of power when we are dealing with significance tests. And power is an idea that you might encounter in a first year statistics course. It's turns out that it's fairly difficult to calculate, but it's interesting to know what it means and what are the levers that might increase the power or decrease the power in a significance test. So just to cut to the chase, power is a probability. You can view it as the probability that you are doing the right thing when the null hypothesis is not true, and the right thing is you should reject the null hypothesis if it's not true. So it's a probability of rejecting, rejecting your null hypothesis given that the null hypothesis is false. So we can view it as a conditional probability like that. But there's other ways to conceptualize it. We can connect it to Type II errors. For example, you could say this is equal to one minus the probability of not rejecting, one minus the probability of not rejecting, not rejecting the null hypothesis given that the null hypothesis is false. And this thing that I just described, not rejecting the null hypothesis given that the null hypothesis is false, this is, that's the definition of a Type II error. So you could view it as just the probability of not making a Type II error, or one minus the probability of making a Type II error. Hopefully that's not confusing. So let me just write it the other way. So you could say it's the probability of not making a Type II error. So what are the things that would actually drive power? And to help us conceptualize that, I'll draw two sampling distributions, one, if we assume that the null hypothesis is true, and one where we assume that the null hypothesis is false, and the true population parameter is something different than the null hypothesis is saying. So for example, let's say that we have a null hypothesis that our population mean is equal to, let's just call it, mu one, and we have an alternative hypothesis, so H sub a, that says, ""Hey, no. ""The population mean is not equal to mu one."" So if you assumed a world where the null hypothesis is true, so I'll do that in blue, so if we assume the null hypothesis is true, what would be our sampling distribution? Remember, what we do in significance tests is we have some form of a population. Let me draw that. You have a population right over here. And our hypotheses are making some statement about a parameter in that population. And to test it, we take a sample of a certain size. We calculate a statistic, in this case, it would be the sample mean, and we say if we assume that our null hypothesis is true, what is the probability of getting that sample statistic? And if that's below a threshold, which we call a significance level, we reject the null hypothesis. And so that world that we have been living in, one way to think about it. In a world where you assume the null hypothesis is true, you might have a sampling distribution that looks something like this. If the null hypothesis is true, then the center of your sampling distribution would be right over here at mu one, and given your sample size, you would get a certain sampling distribution for the sample means. If your sample size increases, this will be narrower. If it decreases, this thing is going to be wider. And you set a significance level, which is essentially your probability of rejecting the null hypothesis even if it is true. You could even view it as, and we've talked about it, you can view your significance level as the probability of making a Type I error. So your significance level is some area. And so let's say it's this area that I'm shading in orange right over here. That would be your significance level. So if you took a sample right over here and you calculated its sample mean and you happened to fall in this area, this area, or this area right over here, then you would reject your null hypothesis. Now if the null hypothesis actually was true, you would be committing a Type I error without knowing about it. But for power, we are concerned with a Type II error. So in this one, it's a conditional probability that our null hypothesis is false. And so let's construct another sampling distribution in the case where our null hypothesis is false. So let me just continue this line right over here, and I'll do that. So let's imagine a world where our null hypothesis is false and it's actually the case that our mean is mu two, and let's say that mu two is right over here, and in this reality, our sampling distribution might look something like this. Once again, it will be for a given sample size. The larger the sample size, the narrower this bell curve would be. And so it might look something like this. So in which situation, so in this world, we should be rejecting the null hypothesis. But what are the samples in which case we are not rejecting the null hypothesis even though we should? Well, we're not going to reject the null hypothesis if we get samples in, if we get a sample here, or a sample here, or a sample here, a sample, where if you assume the null hypothesis is true, the probability isn't that unlikely. And so the probability of making a Type II error when we should reject the null hypothesis but we don't is actually this area right over here. And the power, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it's false, so given that it's false would be this red distribution, that would be the rest of this area right over here. So how can we increase the power? Well, one way is to increase our alpha, increase our significance level. If we increase our significance level, say from that, well, the significance level is an area. So if we want it to go up, if we increase the area, and it looks something like that, now by expanding that significance area, we have increased the power because now this yellow area is larger. We've pushed this boundary to the left of it. Now you might say, ""Oh, well, hey. ""If we want to increase the power, ""power sounds like a good thing, ""why don't we just always increase alpha?"" Well, the problem with that is if you increase alpha, so let me write this down, so if you take alpha, your significance level, and you increase it, that will increase the power. That will increase the power, but it's also going to increase your probability of a Type I error, because remember, that's one way to conceptualize what alpha is, what your significance level is. It's a probability of a Type I error. Now what are other ways to increase your power? Well, if you increase your sample size, then both of these distributions will, these sampling distributions are going to get narrower. And so if these sampling distributions, if both of these sampling distributions get narrower, then that situation where you are not rejecting your null hypothesis even though you should is going to have a lot less area. There's gonna be, one way to think about it, there's going to be a lot less overlap between these two sampling distributions. And so let me write that down. So another way is to, if you increase n, your sample size, that's going to increase your power. And this in general is always a good thing if you can do it. Now other things that may or may not be under your control is well, the less variability there is in the dataset, that would also make the sampling distributions narrower, and that would also increase the power. So less variability and you could measure that as by variance or standard deviation of your underlying dataset, that would increase your power. Another thing that would increase the power is if the true parameter is further away than what the null hypothesis is saying. So if you say true parameter, far from null hypothesis what it's saying, that also will increase the power. So these two are not typically under your control but the sample size is and the significance level is. Significance level, there's a trade-off though. If you increase the power through that, you're also increasing the probability of a Type I error. So for a lot of researchers, they might say, ""Hey, if a Type II error is worse, ""I'm willing to make this trade-off. ""I'll increase the significance level. ""But if a Type I error is actually what I'm afraid of, ""then I wouldn't want top use this lever."" But in any case, increasing your sample size, if you can do it, is going to be a good thing.",math_ap-statistics_tests-significance-ap
" Let's explore what it means to subtract numbers. So let's say that I want to figure out what 4, what 4 minus 3 is. 4 minus 3. So one way to think about this, is you start with 4 objects. And so let me just draw 4 objects. So there I have 1, 2, 3, and 4. And when I ... So this is the 4 objects right over here. And when I say minus 3, or if I'm going to subtract 3 from the 4, one way to think about it is, I'm going to take 3 of these 4 objects away. So let's do that. So I'm going to take away 1, I'm going to take away 2, and I'm going to take away 3. Notice, I took away 1, 2, 3 objects. So how many do I have leftover? Well, if I start with 4 and I take away 3, I subtract 3, 4 minus 3, I am left with, I am left with, 1 object, right over here. So 4 minus 3 is equal to, is equal to 1. Fascinating. Let's do another one of these. Let's figure out what 5, what 5, what 5 minus 2 is. And let's write it this way. Let's say we want to figure out something, some question mark, some question mark ... Actually, let me just clear this out. I'll just do it right over here, actually. So let's say we have some question mark. So there's some unknown number right over here. So I'll just put a question mark over here. And we say that unknown number is equal to, is equal to 5, 5 minus 2. Minus 2. Minus 2. So what is this going to be? Well let's visualize it. This means I have 5 things and I'm going to take away 2 of them and this is going to be what I have leftover after I start with 5 and take away 2. So I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 things. Now I am going to take away 2 of them. So I'm going to take away 1 and 2. So I took away 1, 2 objects. So how many do I have leftover? Well, I have leftover these, these ... Let me do this in a different color. I have leftover these purple things right over here. So how many is that? How many do I have leftover? Well, I have leftover 1, 2, 3 of my original 5. So something is equal is 5 minus 2. That something is 3. 3 is equal to 5 minus 2. Let me just replace this with a 3. So we see that 3 ... Actually, let me do the 3 in the same color as this green. So we see that 3, 3 is equal to 5 minus 2 or we could say that 5 minus 2 is equal to 3. Either way.",math_cc-kindergarten-math_cc-kindergarten-add-subtract
" Now that we know a little bit about multiplying positive and negative numbers, Let's think about how how we can divide them. Now what you'll see is that it's actually a very similar methodology. That if both are positive, you'll get a positive answer. If one is negative, or the other, but not both, you'll get a negative answer. And if both are negative, they'll cancel out and you'll get a positive answer. But let's apply and I encourage you to pause this video and try these out yourself and then see if you get the same answer that I'm going to get. So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2). So if I just said eight (8) divided by two (2), that would be a positive four (4), but since exactly one of these two numbers are negative, this one right over here, the answer is going to be negative. So eight (8) divided by negative two (-2) is negative four (-4). Now negative sixteen (-16) divided by positive four (4)-- now be very careful here. If I just said positive sixteen (16) divided by positive four (4), that would just be four (4). But because one of these two numbers is negative, and exactly one of these two numbers is negative, then I'm going to get a negative answer. Now I have negative thirty (-30) divided by negative five (-5). If I just said thirty (30) divided by five (5), I'd get a positive six (6). And because I have a negative divided by a negative, the negatives cancel out, so my answer will still be positive six (6)! And I could even write a positive (+) out there, I don't have to, but this is a positive six (6). A negative divided by a negative, just like a negative times a negative, you're gonna get a positive answer. Eighteen (18) divided by two (2)! And this is a little bit of a trick question. This is what you knew how to do before we even talked about negative numbers: This is a positive divided by a positive. Which is going to be a positive. So that is going to be equal to positive nine (9). Now we start doing some interesting things, here's kind of a compound problem. We have some multiplication and some division going on. And so first right over here, the way this is written, we're gonna wanna multiply the numerator out, and if you're not familiar with this little dot symbol, it's just another way of writing multiplication. I could've written this little ""x"" thing over here but what you're gonna see in Algebra is that the dot become much more common. Because the X becomes used for other-- People don't want to confuse it with the letter X which gets used a lot in Algebra. That's why they used the dot very often. So this just says negative seven (-7) times three (3) in the numerator, and we're gonna take that product and divide it by negative one (-1). So the numerator, negative seven (-7) times three (3), positive seven (7) times three (3) would be twenty-one (21), but since exactly one of these two are negative, this is going to be negative twenty-one (-21), that's gonna be negative twenty-one (-21) over negative one (-1). And so negative twenty-one (-21) divided by negative one (-1), negative divided by a negative is going to be a positive. So this is going to be a positive twenty-one (21). Let me write all these things down. So if I were to take a positive divided by a negative, that's going to be a negative. If I had a negative divided by a positive, that's also going to be a negative. If I have a negative divided by a negative, that's going to give me a positive, and if obviously a positive divided by a positive, that's also going to give me a positive. Now let's do this last one over here. This is actually all multiplication, but it's interesting, because we're multiplying three (3) things, which we haven't done yet. And we could just go from left to right over here, and we could first think about negative two (-2) times negative seven (-7). Negative two (-2) times negative seven (-7). They are both negatives, and negatives cancel out, so this would give us, this part right over here, will give us positive fourteen (14). And so we're going to multiply positive fourteen (14) times this negative one (-1), times -1. Now we have a positive times a negative. Exactly one of them is negative, so this is going to be negative answer, it's gonna give me negative fourteen (-14). Now let me give you a couple of more, I guess we could call these trick problems. What would happen if I had zero (0) divided by negative five (-5). Well this is zero negative fifths So zero divided by anything that's non-zero is just going to equal to zero. But what if it were the other way around? What happens if we said negative five divided by zero? Well, we don't know what happens when you divide things by zero. We haven't defined that. There's arguments for multiple ways to conceptualize this, so we traditionally do say that this is undefined. We haven't defined what happens when something is divided by zero. And similarly, even when we had zero divided by zero, this is still, this is still, undefined.",math_in-in-class-7-math-kv_in-in-7-kv-integers
" -  Let's say we take this shoe. Instead of sitting it on the floor, here's one that trips people out. Let's say we take this shoe, and we shove it against the wall. So, walls can exert normal forces just like floors can, but when this happens, people start to get a little bit concerned, it starts to get a little bit weird. Let's say we exert a force, so say the force looks like this. So here we go, let's call this force F4. So here's F4, this force keeps the shoe from falling down, but it also pushes the shoe into the wall, so again, we're gonna have a normal force, let me give you an angle here, let's say this angle right there is phi. And let's say the question we wanna ask, now, we wanna know what's the normal force in this case? So this one's a little bit weirder, but we can still do it the same way, we should draw a force diagram first, it's always good practice, draw what forces are exerted on the object you're trying to find a force for. So, we're gonna have the normal force, but first we should draw the force of gravity. Gravity's easy, gravity always points down. So, you got mg straight down. We're gonna have a normal force, here's where people make a mistake. We will not draw the normal force up. People think that the normal force is always mg, we saw that that's not true. People also think the normal force is always up, but it's not. It's usually up because it's in contact with a horizontal surface. But now this is contact with a vertical surface. And this word ""normal"" in the phrase ""Normal Force"" is not referring to like, boring, or usual, it's referring to ""normal"" in the mathematical sense as perpendicular, perpendicular to the surface exerting this normal force. And this wall, that's vertical, perpendicular to that wall is coming out of the wall, and that's gonna be to the right, so the wall is gonna push to the right on the shoe to keep the shoe from penetrating this wall. So that's a little bit weird for people, is that this normal force is now pushing to the right. Now I've got one more force, I've got my F4, so I'm gonna draw this force, at 4 it looks something like that. Okay, so these are my forces. That's it, those are the only forces there are. I mean, we're gonna neglect any friction, let's just assume that the shoe's just sitting there, there's no other frictional forces, let's say this is it, we wanna find the normal force, what do we do? Again, we're gonna use Newton's Second Law, we're gonna use a equals the net force in a certain direction, this time we're gonna use the horizontal direction, we're gonna use the horizontal direction because the force we wanna find, our normal force, is in the horizontal direction. So, the acceleration in the x direction is gonna be what? Well, you think about this, if I'm pushing the shoe into the wall, it's probably got no horizontal acceleration, even if it was sliding up and down. Even if there was motion up and down, it's probably not penetrating into this wall and it's probably not bouncing off of this wall, it's probably constricted to be only in the plain of this wall, so there's gonna be no horizontal acceleration. And if that doesn't make sense, it's because there's no motion in the horizontal direction, left or right. There's no velocity, change, at all, in this horizontal direction, because the shoe's not gonna be moving in that horizontal direction, and it continues to not move in that horizontal direction. So our acceleration horizontally is just zero equals the net force, divided by the mass. Alright, the net force in the x direction. What are we gonna have in the x direction? Well I've got fn pointing to the right, so again that's a positive force I'm gonna consider rightward to be positive, and I've got this F4, part of it points to the left, so just like before, I've gotta break this force up, I've gotta figure out how much of this force points horizontal, and how much of this force points vertical, to get this F4 in the x direction, which is what I plug into this formula up here, because I need this component here. This is the horizontal force of F4, not the vertical force. I don't plug the vertical force in anymore, because this vertical force is not part of the x direction, we're considering Newton's Second Law for the x direction, so to solve for F4x, I'm just gonna again use sine, because this angle, the opposite of this angle is F4x. I'm gonna use sine of theta, oh sorry, sine of phi. I'm gonna take sine of phi, that's gonna equal F4 and the x, divided by the total amount, F4, I get F4 in the x, is gonna be F4 times sine of phi, and now I can use this up here, but you gotta be careful with sines F4x points left, I'm gonna consider that a negative force. So if F4 sine theta represents the magnitude, I'll write this as negative F4, sine, phi, sorry, I keep saying theta, I mean phi, I multiply both sides by m, I'll get zero again on the left hand side, equals, I've got Fn minus F4, sine phi, and now, when I solve this for Fn, the normal force, I'll get the Fn, I'll add this F4 sine phi to both sides, and I'll get that this normal force is gonna equal F4 sine phi. And that makes sense. It makes sense because, what these surfaces are doing, the reason why you're getting a normal force, is these surfaces are exerting whatever force they have to, to prevent any penetration of this surface. So, if this F4x is pushing in to the surface with F4x, right, if that's the force we're pushing in with, Fn's just gotta equal that. It's gotta match that so that there's no acceleration horizontally. There were no other forces. We could, now you know what to do if there were, if you wanted to step this up, you could add another force here, we'll call that F5, that'd be another force this way, we'd have another F5, you know how to handle that, now you'd come over to here, that's pointing to the left, so you do minus F5, you'd come down here, this would be a minus F5, you'd add that to both sides, that'd be a plus F5. What if we added a vertical force? What if we added another vertical force this way to the shoe and we called that F6? Well that wouldn't impact the normal force at all. This force F6 does not affect how much these surfaces are getting pushed into each other. So I wouldn't include that over here at all. That's a vertical force, it wouldn't affect the normal force this time. Also note, gravity's not even affecting the normal force this time. 'Cause gravity's exerting a force in the vertical direction, and our normal force is in the horizontal direction. So, long story short, normal force is not always mg, the normal force will only exist, it'll only be non zero when two surfaces are in contact and pushing on each other. You can change what the normal force is by adding forces into or out of the surface, exerted on that object. And if there's a force at an angle, when you're finding normal force, make sure you only use the component that's in the same direction as the normal force, 'cause that's the only one that's gonna affect the normal force when you solve using Newton's Second Law.",science_in-in-class11th-physics_in-in-class11th-physics-laws-of-motion
" -  So, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and every other type of dementia causes damage to your brain cells, right, which, in turn, causes some difficulties with various things your brain controls, like memory, language, reasoning, and judgement. But a lot of the time, these signs and symptoms can present themselves slightly differently. Since Alzheimer's disease accounts for the majority of dementia cases and the other forms can often overlap anyways, the main focus here will be on the symptoms and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Dementia in Alzheimer's disease typically develop over the course of years, but the speed at which it develops can vary pretty dramatically, from four years in some patients, eight in others, and even as high as 20 years in some cases. We're going to go through some of the general stages of progressing Alzheimer's disease, but considering that it's such a gradual disease, it's actually really tough to classify this progression. And it's important to remember that there are no clear-cut or well-defined stages, and many of these stages that we'll go through can even overlap. But, with that said, there are a few models that are used for the progression of Alzheimer's disease, and we're going to sort of combine the definitions from a more broad three-stage model and also the more specific seven-stage Reisberg Scale. So, from the three-stage model, we have the very early to mild stages of Alzheimer's, lasting about two to seven years. And then, if we look at the Reisberg Scale, stage one is simply no impairment. So, your memory and cognitive abilities appear normal, especially to everyone else. If there are any impairments, they might only be slightly apparent to the patient themselves. Stage two, however, is a very mild cognitive decline. So, maybe they have some trouble remembering recent events or information, but it could be more subtle things like forgetting a word or misplacing things. And, again, at this stage, these lapses and changes in thinking aren't usually detected by friends, family, or even medical personnel, especially considering half of all people over 65 begin noticing problems with concentration and word recall just as a normal consequence of aging. Stage three is signs of early confusion and mild cognitive impairment. At this point, subtle difficulties can start to impact their daily life. The patient might consciously or even subconsciously try to hide these issues. They might have trouble retrieving words, remembering what was just said or read, and planning and organizing, which can all start to affect life at home or at work. It could still be difficult, though, to diagnose Alzheimer's at this very early stage. Now, stage four is considered mild Alzheimer's disease. This stage lasts about two years. And during these two years, things like ficials and math start to become very challenging. And the ability to remember recent events and what was just learned becomes increasingly difficult. The patient might have trouble carrying out tasks, especially if there are specific sequences, like cooking or driving. But the patients are still usually able to recognize their family and friends, although a diagnosis at this stage is usually accurate. Stage five is considered early dementia to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In this stage, cognitive decline starts to become more drastic, and the patient requires assistance. They'll probably have trouble remembering things like address or phone number and can be disoriented very easily regarding the time or place. Decision and judgement skills can also be affected, like choosing the appropriate clothes for the day or season. And so, the patient may need increased supervision. This stage can last an average of about 1.5 years. Stage six is considered moderately severe Alzheimer's disease, and in this stage, there's a significant lack of awareness of present events, and this inability to remember the past and carry on a conversation, and they'll likely need help with basic daily tasks like getting dressed, eating, and going to the bathroom. The patient will likely be unable to recall names of family members but will likely know that they're familiar. This stage lasts about 2.5 years. In the final stage or stage seven, speech becomes severely limited, and we see a serious decline in basic abilities. Even movement abilities begin to be affected as the disease has started to spread to those areas of the brain, so eating, walking, sitting, or even standing up all start to fade. And patients will likely need extensive assistance eating and drinking, as they can lose the ability to discern when they're thirsty or hungry. And so they need total assistance around the clock for all functions of daily life and care. And at this stage, due to these inabilities, they become much more susceptible to secondary complications, diseases and infections, especially pneumonia and falls. And this final stage can last from one to two and a half years. But, again, it's very important to stress the flexibility in this timeline, in these stages. Not all patients with Alzheimer's will experience this exact progression, and some may deviate significantly from the expected duration with each stage and the disease itself.",science_health-and-medicine_mental-health
" In the last video, we attempted to approximate the area under a curve by constructing four rectangles of equal width and using the left boundary of each rectangle, the function evaluated at the left boundary, to determine the height, and we came up with an approximation. What I want to do in this video is generalize things a bit using the exact same method, but doing it for an arbitrary function with arbitrary boundaries and an arbitrary number of rectangles. So let's do it. So I'm going to draw the diagram as large as I can to make things as clear as possible. So that's my y-axis. And this right over here is my x-axis. Let me draw an arbitrary function. So let's say my function looks something like that. So that is y is equal to f of x. And let me define my boundaries. So let's say this right over here is x equals a. And this right over here is x equals b. So this is b. And I'm going to use n rectangles, and I'm going to use the function evaluated at the left boundary of the rectangle to determine its height. So, for example, this will be rectangle one. I'm going to evaluate what f of a is. So this right over here is f of a. And then I'm going to use that as the height of my first rectangle. So just like that. So rectangle number one looks like this. And I'll even number it. Rectangle one looks just like that. And just to have a convention here, because I'm going to want to label each of the x values at the left boundary, so we'll say a is equal to x0. a is equal to x0. So we could also call this point right over here x0, that x value. And then we go to the next rectangle. And we could call this one right over here, this x value, we'll call it x1. It's the left boundary of the next rectangle. If we evaluate f of x1, we get this value right over here. This right over here is f of x1, so it tells us our height. And we want an equal width to the previous one. We'll think about what the width is going to be in a second. So this right over here is our second rectangle that we're going to use to approximate the area under the curve. That's rectangle number two. Let's do rectangle number three. Well, rectangle number three, the left boundary, we're just going to call that x sub 2. And its height is going to be f of x sub 2. And its width is going to be the same width as the other ones. I'm just eyeballing it right over here. So this is rectangle number three. And we're going to continue this process all the way until we get to rectangle number n. So this is the n-th rectangle right over here, the n-th rectangle. And what am I going to label this point right over here? Well, we already see a pattern. The left boundary of the first rectangle is x sub 0. The left boundary of the second rectangle is x sub 1. The left boundary of the third rectangle is x sub 2. So the left boundary of the n-th rectangle is going to be x sub n minus 1. Whatever the rectangle number is, the left boundary is x sub that number minus 1. And this is just based on the convention that we've defined. Now, the next thing that we need to do in order to actually calculate this area is think about what is the width? So let's call the width of any of these rectangles-- and for these purposes, or the purpose of this example, I'm going to assume that it's constant, although you can do these sums where you actually vary the width of the rectangle. But then it gets a little bit fancier. So I want it equal width. So I want delta x to be equal width. And to think about what that has to be, we just have to think, what's the total width that we're covering? Well, the total distance here is going to be b minus a, and we're just going to divide by the number of rectangles that we want, the number of sections that we want. So we want to divide by n. So if we assume this is true, and then we assume that a is equal to x0, and then x1 is equal to x0 plus delta x, x2 is equal to x1 plus delta x, and we go all the way to xn is equal to xn minus 1 plus delta x, then we've essentially set up this diagram right over here. b is actually going to be equal xn. So this is xn. It's equal to xn minus 1 plus delta x. So now I think we've set up all of the notation and all the conventions in order to actually calculate the area, or our approximation of the area. So our approximation, approximate area, is going to be equal to what? Well, it's going to be the area of the first rectangle-- so let me write this down. So it's going to be rectangle one-- so the area of rectangle one-- so rectangle one plus the area of rectangle two plus the area of rectangle three-- I think you get the point here-- plus all the way to the area of rectangle n. And so what are these going to be? Rectangle one is going to be its height, which is f of x0 or f of a. Either way. x0 and a are the same thing. So it's f of a times our delta x, times our width, our height times our width. So times delta-- actually I can write as f of x0, I wanted to write-- f of x0 times delta x. What is our height of rectangle two? It's f of x1 times delta x. What's our area of rectangle three? It's f of x2 times delta x. And then we go all the way to our area. We're taking all the sums, all the way to rectangle n. What's its area? It's f of x sub n minus 1. Actually, that's a different shade of orange. I'll use that same shade. It is f of x sub n minus 1 times delta x. And we're done. We've written it in a very general way. But to really make us comfortable with the various forms of notation, especially the types of notation you might see when people are talking about approximating the areas or sums in general, I'm going to use the traditional sigma notation. So another way we could write this, as the sum, this is equal to the sum from-- and remember, this is just based on the conventions that I set up. I'll let i count which rectangle we're in, from i equals 1 to n. And then we're going to look at each rectangle. So the first rectangle, that's rectangle one. So it's going to be f of-- well, if we're in the i-th rectangle, then the left boundary is going to be x sub i minus 1 times delta x. And so here, right over here, is a general way of thinking about approximating the area under a curve using rectangles, where the height of the rectangles are defined by the left boundary. And this tells us it's the left boundary. And we see for each, if this is the i-th rectangle right over here, if this is rectangle i, then this right over here is x sub i minus 1, and this height right over here is f of x sub i minus 1. So that's all we did right over there times delta x. And then you sum of these from the first rectangle all the way to the end. So hopefully that makes you a little bit more comfortable with this notation. We're not doing anything different than we did in this first video, which was hopefully fairly straightforward for you. We have just generalized it using a little bit more mathy notation.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-integration-new
" Before we get into the nomenclature of alkynes, let's review a few of the things we learned in the video on sp hybridization. So we learned that when a triple bond is present in a molecule, these carbon atoms right here are sp hybridized. And we talked about how the geometry around our sp hybridized atoms must be linear. So this bond angle right here is 180 degrees, which makes this portion of the molecule with the triple bond in it linear, like that. And in that triple bond, we know that one of those bonds is a sigma bond, and two of those bonds are pi bonds, OK? So if you don't remember that stuff, you need to go back and watch the video on sp hybridization. So this particular alkyne right here has alkyl groups on either side of my triple bond. So it's a disubstituted alkyne, and the more common term you'll see for that would be an internal alkyne. So let's go ahead and write that. So it's an internal alkyne. Which just means that the triple bond is found in the interior of the molecule in the interior of the chain. The triple bond is not found on the end. So that's an internal alkyne, which is different from a terminal alkyne. So let's go ahead and draw a terminal alkyne. And this is just where your triple bond is at the end of your carbon chain. So if I put a hydrogen on one side, now it's only monosubstituted, and the triple bond is on the end, or the terminal, of my alkyne. So this is a terminal alkyne, like this. So it's important to distinguish between these, because in future videos we'll see how things like terminal alkynes have special properties. So let's talk about the nomenclature of alkynes now. And let's start with the simplest alkyne, a two carbon alkyne-- so a triple bond between two carbons, like that. And let's just clear up that triple bond there a little bit. So this is our triple bond between our two carbons, like that, and I have hydrogens on either side. So when we talked about two carbons for nomenclature, our root was eth-, and since we're dealing with alkynes, our ending is going to be -yne here. So I stick the root together with the ending, so I take eth- and I add the -yne to it, so it's called ethyne. So ethyne would be the IUPAC name for this molecule. That's probably not the name that's used most frequently. This is the most famous alkyne, also called acetylene. So you've heard of acetylene torches before, and you can do a very cool demonstration called underwater fireworks where you use acetylene in there. So this is acetylene, which is the common name or ethyne, which is more the IUPAC name, and this is the simplest alkyne. So let's name another one here. Let's get an actual chain, a carbon chain in here, and let's see how to name this one like that. Well, the first thing to notice is the straight line that surrounds our triple bond there. And remember, that's because that portion of the molecule is linear, because those carbons are sp hybridized. So when you're drawing Lewis Dot Structures, you'll notice that almost everyone will draw that portion of the molecule straight to better reflect the actual geometry of the molecule. All right, so I need to figure out how many carbons are in this alkyne. So I find my longest carbon chain including my triple bond. So let's see, here is one carbon, two carbons, three carbons, four, and five. So a five carbon alkyne. So remember your root for five carbons would be pent-. So it would be pentane if it was an alkane, but since it's an alkyne, it would be pentyne. So this is pentyne. So I have that much so far. Next, I need to figure out how to number my chain. So I could number it from the left, or I could number it from the right. My goal is to give my triple bond the lowest number possible, so it's a lot like double bonds here. So I want to give my triple bond the lowest number possible, and that means, of course, I need to start from the right here. So if I start from the right, and I say this is carbon one, then my triple bond starts at carbon two. And then this would be carbon three, carbon four, and carbon five, like that. So the triple bond starts at carbon two, so all I have to do is put a two in here and say 2-pentyne. So in that respect, it's just like naming alkenes here. So that's 2-pentyne. Let's do another one, one that's a little bit more complicated than that. So let's look at this molecule here. So there's my triple bond, and then I have-- let's see, I'll put in a chain and some methyl groups there-- and so this is my molecule. All right, so once again find the longest carbon chain that includes your triple bond. So that would be one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven. So seven carbons would be hept-, so it's heptyne. So let's go ahead and write heptyne in here. So this molecule would be heptyne, like that. And let's go ahead and number it, right? I want to number to give my triple bond the highest priority here. So in this case, if I start from the left or start from the right, there'd be a two for either that methyl group or for the start of my triple bond. The triple bond is going to win. You want to give the triple bond the highest priority, and that's the reason you're going to start numbering from the left. OK, so you're going to go one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven, like that. And so now we can see that our triple bond starts at carbon two. So I'm going to write 2-heptyne here, like that. And what else do I have? Well at carbon five and at carbon six, I have methyl groups. So it'd be 5, 6-dimethyl, so go ahead and put that in here, 5, 6-dimethyl-2-heptyne, like that. And this is kind of the old school way of naming it. So old IUPAC recommendations would say to name it this way, and maybe most organic chemistry professors will still name this molecule this way. But there's a newer way that IUPAC recommends that you name this molecule. So it would still be 5, 6-dimethyl, except now you would go ahead and write hept, and then you would put the 2 in between the ending. So it would be hept-2-yne, like that. So the first way is more old school, the second way is more the new way of doing it. Either way is perfectly acceptable, just make sure to do the one that your professor prefers.",science_organic-chemistry_alkenes-alkynes
" - All right this is a universal remote control we're going to take it apart today, see what's inside it and what makes it tick. There are two different kinds of universal remote controls. There are learning remotes and then there are ones that function on code libraries. So this one functions on a code library. The learning remotes tend to be more expensive, but what the learning remotes do is you have a learning remote and you can you can put it next to the original remote and basically it uses the original remote to program the learning remote and then it will function there and those like I said tend to be more expensive, more complex. This one just has a code library built in and so you enter a certain sequence of numbers and you can pull up a certain code and then that will allow this to trigger whatever device that code goes with. So I've already cut the box apart here. Let's go ahead and pull the remote out. Okay, so you can see it's got a number of different buttons on here, can each perform different functions, and there's a little LED, a light emitting diode that lights up there. And let's take the back part of it out and this is a, this is a little battery cover and the battery cover is injection molded and you can tell that for a number of reasons. One is it's very precisely made and the other is that it has a has these little injection, ejector pins marks on it. So those little circles are pins that were used to to push the part out of the mold after it was made. And you can see right here it says ABS plastic. So it's an ABS plastic part, and ABS was selected because it's fairly low cost and impact resistant and we all know that remote controls tend to get beat up and knocked around a lot, so that's a good plastic to use. So let's see if we can pop this apart. Usually these, these devices have, yeah there we go. All right, this one's molded together. All right. All right, so this device is used uses what's called an interference fit or a snap fit, and again the bottom housing and the top housing are made out of ABS plastic. You can see that again right here, just the ABS symbol there and the plastic recycling symbol. And anyways so these things are called bosses or stand-offs and they hold the circuit board in place, and these are the little tabs that allow it to snap together. Now the reason it doesn't have any screws is that it helps to reduce cost. So this remote was very inexpensive and so reducing cost was a key way to to be able to produce it for a low amount and still make money selling them. Okay so you can see we've got a number of different components here. These things, these springs right here are what the batteries connect to. So there's springs on the inside here and then other ones here. So there, it looks like it uses triple A batteries and the power goes through these springs to the other side of the board and we have a, it looks like a resister here, maybe a filter of some sort and a capacitor, dielectric capacitor. And then up here we've got a infrared LED. So that shines light in the infrared spectrum. So you can't see it with the visibile eye. If you had an infrared camera you could see it, it would be shining like a flashlight, but since we can't see in infrared it looks invisible, which is kind of nice, because you don't want to constantly be shining a flashing on your TV or your stereo, and then there's a little indicator LED here. So let's turn that over. Then we have our printed circuit board and our buttons. Another reason for injection molding is it's very precise and so you can get really nice clean fit. So these buttons fit nicely into there. These buttons are a great way to reduce cost too, because they're, there's no springs that cause the buttons to return. It's actually the material itself. So this material is a material called Santoprene and it has a particular resilience and so it causes the button to return to its original location after it's pressed and there's no need for springs. And then there's these little conductive contacts down here, and those conductive contacts when a button is pressed connect these little conductive exposed fingers here. So there's these little parts and I'm not sure if you can see those very clearly, but these little tiny parts here have these interlocking exposed contacts. And so they're shaped like this, and so when you push a button it causes the conductor on the back here to come into contact with those exposed fingers and it makes the, sends the electrical impulse to this guy, which is a a little integrated circuit and it stores the code library and it also interprets the signals from each of these switches. So if you're watching, you know, channel four and you push, you know, you want to watch channel four and you push channel four and it triggers this connection here then this thing sends, tells the tells the batteries to send power to the LED and it blinks and the infrared LED blinks in a particular pattern and that pattern is interpreted by your stereo or your TV and it causes the stereo or TV to change to that station or channel. And you can see on the back this whole board right here is made out of fiber glass and it's got a thin layer of copper applied to the back. You can see in places the copper is etched away and there's just, the places where you see the sort lighter green is where the copper is and the places where it's darker there's no copper. So what that does is it allows you to create like wires that connect everything together. The copper acts like a wire, it's a conductor, and the spaces between the copper function like an insulator. So you don't have any shorts, but so these little copper connections here are, allow for a current to flow and they send signals back to the microprocessor, again the microprocessor interprets those and then sends signals to the infrared LED which sends the signals off to your TV. And if you could see this with an infrared, again, if you could see it with an infrared camera you'd see different sequences of flashes coming from this LED and those would be what triggers the change in in your TV or your stereo, and the contacts here are coated so that they don't corrode and also so that that they are insulated somewhat. They're coated usually with like a lacquer coating. And then this shiny metal here this is called solder and it basically fasten connectors like this to the other side of the board and make sure that there's a conductive connection there so that the power from the batteries gets sent to the board. Anyway that's it, that's our universal remote.",science_electrical-engineering_reverse-engin
" Let's see if we can extend the path counting brain teaser to three dimensions. So let's say that I had a three by three cube. I'll keep it at three by three to keep the math from getting too hairy. So let me draw it like that. I won't use a line tool just because-- well, maybe I should have. So let's see. The front of the cube looks something like that. That's the front of the cube. And the cube goes backwards like that. Comes down. Goes like that. It's a three by three, like a Rubik's Cube. I could have drawn this little bit better, but I think this will meet our needs. OK. There you go. Three by three cube. And so our goal is to get from this back left cube. This top corner back left cube. And get to this front, bottom right cube. So this is our goal. I'll do it in this yellow. This is our goal right there. And we're allowed to either go forward. From any cube, these are our three operations or our three movements we can do. We can go forward, or I guess towards the front. We could go down. Or we can go to the right. So I can draw it here. We can go from that cube to that cube. So just like the two dimensional problem, you're only allowed to make forward progress. You're not allowed to come down here, and then go to over here. You're allowed to go down here, then here, but then you're not allowed to go up. So every step you're getting a little bit closer, from this back left top cube, to this front bottom, right cube. And so the same question applies, how many different ways are there to get from there to there? And you can pause it now and try it yourself, because I'm about to explain how to do it. And the first thing, when you tried to do it yourself, is to realize, boy this is hard to visualize. Even if I had to draw this out, I'd have to go in and then out. I mean, how do I even visualize a three dimensional cube like this? And the best way to do is to separately visualize each of the separate layers. So let's do that. Let's make this the magenta layer up here. We'll call that layer one. So this is the magenta layer up here. And you'll see what I'm doing in a second. This is the mauve layer right there. And then finally I'll do the orange layer. The orange layer is that one right there. What we can do is separately draw each of these layers. So first, let's do the magenta layer. So the magenta layer will look like this. And now I'll use things that help-- nope, not like that. I want to use the other tool. The magenta layer. Let me draw some squares in here. It's like that, and like that, and like that, and like that. And then, the middle one was the mauve layer. We'll draw that. The mauve layer looks something like that. And you can imagine I'm slicing it, and just looking at it from above. That's the idea here. And it's going to help us visualize this problem. So the mauve layer looks something like that. And then finally the orange layer. Looks like this. And we're almost ready to actually start doing the problem. Good enough. So just to make sure we understand our visualization, this layer up here-- we call that layer one. We could but this as box one. This layer is layer two. So I'll put a little two here. And I don't want to get these confused with the paths and all that, so I'm writing it really small. And this is layer three, or level three. And that's right there. And just to make sure you understand, this corner right there, this is our start point. And that's right there. Right? Because this is a whole top. So this is the back left of the top. And are finish point, the bottom right, is right here. So, essentially, our problem goes from, how many ways to get from there to there, to how many ways to get from there to there? So let's just stay within a layer. So how many ways can I get to this point right here? Well I can only go from this point, and go straight in the layer like that. So there's only one way to get there. That movement is the exact same movement as this right here. Going from this box to this box. So there's one way to get there. That's the same thing as there. And similarly, I could go there. And I can just go one more step. So there's only one way to get there. And that's like going there and then there. And by the same logic, I could go one to the right here. That's the only way to get there. Or I could go two to the right there. And that's the only way to get there. And now if you watched the two dimensional path counting brain teaser, you know that there's two ways to get here. And the logic is, well you could draw it out. You could go like that. One, two. And that's the same thing as saying, one, two. Though it's easier to visualize here. But the general logic was, well, to know how many ways to get to any square, think about the squares that lead to it, and how many ways can I get to those two squares? And then sum them up. And by the same logic-- so there's two ways to get here. That's that cell. Three ways to get here, right? Two plus one is three. One plus two is three. And three plus three is six. So there were six ways to get to this cube right there, from that one. So this isn't too different from the two dimensional problem so far. But now it gets interesting. So how many ways-- I did this in yellow, but I should have done it in the color of that layer. How many ways are there to get to this cell right here? This cell is that one right there. Well, I start here. And I can just go straight down. There's only one way to be there. But I go straight down. So there's only one way to get there. Actually let's extend. There's only one way to get here, if I'm going straight down. And so there's only one way to get to this cell too. I'd have to go straight down again. So there's only one way to get there. Hopefully you understand the way we're visualizing it. This is the bottom row. And there's only one way. You go from here, straight down to there, straight down to there. And that's the only way to get there. Fair enough. Now this is where it gets interesting. How many ways are there to get to this cell? Well in our old example, there was only one way in two dimensions to go from this cell. But now we can go from this cell, and we could come from above. And where's above? Above is right there. So now we add this cell to that cell. So one plus one is, there are two ways to get there. How many ways to get to this? You can't even see it. This is kind of in the back middle of this cube. How many ways to get there? Well, there's two ways to come from this direction. And I can also come from above right there. So two plus one is three. How many ways to get here? Well, one from behind. And then one from above. So that's two. And you see a little bit of symmetry. And how many ways to come here. Well there's two here. From going straight forward. Two ways to go that way. And then one way to come from above. This is two, and we're on this cell. So if we wanted to know how many ways to get to this cell? There's two ways to go from there. And then one way from above. So that's three. And now, right here, how many ways to get to this cell? There's three ways. I could come from here, from here, or from above. So I have the two plus two plus two is six. Likewise, here, I can come from six plus three is nine. But I can also come from above. From here. So there's 12 ways to get there. And you can do the same logic. How many ways to get here? Well, within the same row there are nine ways. Six plus three is nine. And then you could come from above as well. That's 12. And finally, how many ways to get to this cell right here, which is this one right there? Well, there's 12 ways to get here. So I could go all of those ways. 12 ways to come from behind it, so that's 24. And then six ways to come from above. So 12 plus 12 is 24 plus six is 30. I think you're seeing the pattern. So how many ways to get here? Well it's one plus two, which is three. How many ways to get here? Well it's three plus three, which is six. How many ways to get here? It's one way here, and two from above. So it's three. How many ways to get here? Well, three from behind and three from above. That's six. Here, it's three plus three is six. But you could also come from above. So six again. So that is 12. How many ways to get here? 12 plus six is 18. But there's 12 ways to come from above as well. So 18 plus 12 is 30. And by the same logic, there's 18 ways to get here from these two cells. But I could also come from above. So that is 30. So how many ways to get to this last cell? Well there's 30 from this direction. 30 ways from there. 30 ways from behind it. That's 60. And then there's another 30 ways to come from above. So there are 90 ways. I could write that there, but you can't see it. 90 ways to get from that cell over there to this cell over here. And then the last video, I made the analogy to the 1binomial theorem. 1And I'll leave you to think about what the three 1dimensional analogy is. 1And I'll throw out a word which is never really 1mentioned in math class, because it's normally too 1hairy to deal with. 1Think about formulating a trinomial theorem, to help you 1multiply things like x plus y plus z to nth power. 1And think about how this cube, or an extension of it. 1This is a three by three by three cube. 1But imagine if it was, you know, an n by n by n cube. 1Then you can start taking things to arbitrary powers. 1So I'll leave you to think about this. 1But I just thought this was a neat visualization problem, 1which is really not any more difficult than the last one. 1Actually, before I leave you I'll leave you with just a 1general principle. 1And this is actually really useful for some standardized 1tests, or just logic games. 1If I'm trying to get to this cell. 1And let's say there's a bunch of ways to get here. 1And it has to have direction. 1So I won't go into a whole graph theory thing. 1But it has to have direction. 1And you can't have cycles. 1Because then you can have infinite ways to get to a 1certain point. 1And let's say that there are x ways to get there. 1Y ways to get there. z ways to get there. 1And a ways to get there. 1I'll cycle through the alphabet. 1And this is just a subset of the larger graph. 1This graph could have a bunch of connections. 1This is just where we are. 1These are all of the nodes that connect to this. 1The general rule that we've learned in the last two brain 1teasers is, you say, OK, how can I get to this node? 1Well I can go from here, here, here, or here. 1And I just have to add up. 1So if I can get from here, there's x ways to 1come via this node. 1Y ways to come via that note. 1z ways to come via that node. 1a ways to come via that node. 1So the total ways to get to that node is x plus 1y plus z plus a. 1And actually, you'll see problems like this if you ever 1plan on becoming a lawyer. 1They actually do have problems like this on the LSAT, that 1aren't maybe as complicated as what we did here. 1But you need understand this principle. 1Anyway hope you enjoyed that.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_puzzles
" Got some paper clips here. I'm going to bend them and make them into antenna that we're going to use for the spout bot so it can bounce into things. So it's good to keep one part of the antenna straight, because that's how the hot glue will sit well on the bot. So I'm going to go ahead and put it right here like this. And so you can see that. And now we're just going to do the same thing for the other side. This part takes a fair amount of patience. It's OK if you spill a little bit of the hot glue, because you can cut it off later, but it is important to hold that antenna still. All right. We can see it works. Our two antenna are in place. We may want to bend those and shape them a little bit, but for now they'll do. So now let's go ahead and connect our final connection, which is the power for the LED eyes. And we're going to use this switch here to turn that power on and off. It's kind of tricky, because you don't want the loop of metal, the loop of the wire, to be too big. Because if it is too big, then it will touch the other side. But you don't also want it to be too small. I think what I'm going to do is just hot glue it down later like I did the other one, too, because it's just coming apart. There we go. So we'll take this one, put it in there like that, and then bend this completely back so that it holds it in place. We'll take our third arm here and see if we can get this to work. There we go. And I'm going to go ahead and solder that one before we do the other side. And that did not actually have very much solder flow. I'm going have to reheat this and see if we can get it to flow. There we go. That's how we want it to look. Now, you can see the switch is on and the lights the eyes work. So turn it off, and we're going to get our needle-nose here and see if we can't get this all wrapped up. There we go. Now, we're going to put down just a little bit of hot glue underneath it, right here like that. And let that cool as we hold it in place. And then we can put a lot more glue on the backside around the wires. And that'll help keep them in place, and also ultimately it'll help hold the switch in place. And I'll wait until the glue turns that sort of milky color, because that'll let me know that it's dry. One other thing we can do to make this a work a little better. Right now we can turn it on, make it run. So it goes pretty well right now. There are a couple things we can do. One thing we can do is we can-- turn it off-- we can take one of the paper clips and bend it to make a tail, so that it drags its tail on the ground and makes it a little less friction for it. So I'm going to take I guess one of these here. We'll go through here like this. One of the things we can do is just pop some of these things out. And then when we put the battery back in, it should help to hold the tail in place. You can also put some heat-shrink tubing on the feet to get them to have a little more grip. And so we're going to do that. I've got a little tubing here like this. And you can use the heat gun, or you can put your soldering iron next to the tubing, and it should help to shrink it up.",science_electrical-engineering_robots
" Let's look at how rods and cones are distributed in the retina. Let me begin by drawing a very simplified diagram of the eyeball. So in the back of the eye, we have the optic nerve exiting and going towards the brain. The back of the eyeball's coated by a specialized membrane known as the retina. This dimpled portion of the retina is known as the fovea, and the part of the retina directly in front of where the optic nerve exits the back of the eye is actually known as the blind spot. This is known as the blind spot because no photo receptors are present in this area. So let's go ahead and look at the distribution of rods and cones in the eye. So rods are mainly found in the periphery of the eyeball, so we're going to use this blue color to represent rods. And they're found mostly in the periphery of the eye, so up here and a little bit over here. And as I mentioned, there are no photo receptors at the blind spot, because that's where the optic nerve actually exits the eye, so there's no photo receptors there. Cones, on the other hand, which we'll represent in purple, are actually found throughout the fovea. So they're found in a really high concentration near the fovea. And there are no cones at the blind spot, and there are very few cones kind of sprinkled throughout the rest of the eye. So they're found kind of sprinkled throughout the periphery of the eye. So let's go ahead and do it on the fovea just to kind of make sense of what we're looking at. So if we zoomed in on the fovea, what we would see would be the retina, so it dimples in at the region where the fovea is. This region from here to here is the fovea. So let's go ahead and draw in the rods and cones. So rods are found, as I mentioned, outside of the fovea, so there are a whole bunch of rods in the eye specifically in the periphery. So outside of the fovea, there are a whole bunch of rods. And there are more runs over here, and they kind of line the periphery of the eye and so on. Cones, on the other hand, are found in a really high concentration near the fovea. So at the fovea, there are a whole bunch of cones. And in the periphery of the eye, there might be a few cones every now and then. So the reason that the fovea actually dimples in here is because these photo receptors are connected to other neurons that actually send axons through the optic nerve into the brain. So there are a whole bunch of neurons over here in this region, and they all have axons that actually go to the optic nerve and exit the back of the eye. And so when light enters the eye and hits the fovea, what it actually looks like is like this. And so the benefit of having no axons in the way of the light is that you actually get a higher resolution, so you actually get more light is able to hit the cones rather than get absorbed by these axons. So if I were to enter this way and hit the periphery of the eye, what you'd have light entering that actually have to go through this bundle of axons. And as it's going through, some of the energy is actually lost, so less light actually hits rods and cones in the periphery. So at the fovea, you actually have light directly hitting the cones rather than having to go through a layer of axons and neurons. So let's look at this same picture in another way. Let's go ahead and look at it graphically. So if I were to draw a graph, and if I were to say that the 0 point on the graph-- so let's go ahead and this is the x-axis, this is the y-axis-- and the 0 point is going to be where the fovea is. So for you to actually take the retina-- so in the eyeball the retina's curved like this. If we were to actually flatten it out, there's a little dimpled region here that's known as the fovea, and we're going to set this to 0. And then you can move away, so this could be five degrees away from the fovea, this could be 10 degrees away from the fovea, this is 15, and so on on both ends. So that's what we're going to do here. So this is going to be 5 degrees away from the fovea, this is 10 degrees, and so on. And we're going to have the same thing on the other side of the fovea as well. So now on the y-axis, what we're going to have is receptor density. So this is the number of receptors found in the retina. So over here we have a low receptor density, and over here we have a high receptor density. So as I mentioned, this region right here is the fovea. And this outside region from here to here and from here to here is the periphery. So in the periphery, there's a really high level of rods. And as we get towards the fovea, the rods drop in numbers. And then as we start to move away from the fovea again, there's a really high number of rods. And we actually reach a region, which is the blind spot. So there, as I mentioned, there are no photo receptors where the blind spot is. And as we get to the other side of the blind spot, there are again photo sectors. And so you kind of get this type of distribution of rods. Cones have a different distribution. So cones, there aren't very many of them in the periphery, but when you get to the fovea, there's a huge spike in the number of cones. And as you again move away from the fovea, the cones actually drop back down. And then at the blind spot, there are no photo receptors. And on the other side of the blind spot, there's a very low number of photo receptors.",science_health-and-medicine_nervous-system-and-sensory-infor

" Maybe you like to draw squiggles when you're bored in class. Somehow the wandering path of the line, that goes the monotone droning of the teacher, perfectly capturing the way it goes on, and on, about the same things, over and over, but without really going anywhere in a deep display of artistic metaphor. But once you're a veteran of bored doodling, you learn that some squiggles are better than others. Good squiggles really fill up the page, squiggling around themselves as densely as possible, in a single line that doesn't cross itself. It's like the ideal would be to sit down at the beginning of your least favorite class, put your pencil on the page, and keep drawing a single line, filling up more and more space until the bell rings, which is basically what your teacher is doing, except with words. You might find yourself developing some strategies. For example, you're careful not to cut off a chunk of space, because you might want to get back in there later. And if you leave only a little room to get to a certain section, then when you go there, you fill up a lot of it before you leave that section again, or else, instead of a doodle, you'll have an unhappy don't-dle. Or maybe you decide to make a meta-squiggle. A squiggle made out of squiggles. This can be done kind of abstractly, or extremely precisely. For example, let's say you're drawing this simple squiggle, then you draw that squiggle, using that squiggle. But to make it fill up space nicely, you make the outside parts bigger. Then to make it precise, you make the number of squiggles always the same. It's easy to keep squiggling this squiggle all the way across the page if you keep the rhythm of it in your head. This one's like, down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up a squiggle. But after you've done that awhile, you decide to go a level deeper. A squiggle, within a squiggle, within a squiggle. That's right, we're going three levels down. This serious business could go something like this. Right a squiggle, left a squiggle, right a squiggle, left, woop, right a squiggle, left a squiggle, right a squiggle, left, woop, right a squiggle, left a squiggle, right a squiggle, left, woop. And the next one is even crazier. Like, and up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down, woop, up a squiggle down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down, woop, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down, woop, wop, all the way over here. And, down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up, woop, down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up, woop, down a squiggle, up a squiggle, down a squiggle, up, wop, all the way over here. OK, but say you're me and you're in math class. This mean that you have graph paper. Opportunity for precision. You could draw that first curve like this. Squig-a, squig-a, squig-a, squig-a, squig-a, squig-a, squig-a, squig-a. The second iteration to fit squiggles going up and down will have a line three boxes across on top and bottom, if you want the squiggles as close on the grid as possible without touching. You might remind yourself by saying, three a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle, three, a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. The next iteration has a woop, and you have to figure out how long that's going to be. Meanwhile, other lengths change to keep everything close. And, two a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. Three, a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. Three a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. Two, nine. Two, a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. Three a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. Three, a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle, two, nine. We could write the pattern down like this. So what would the next pattern be? Five. Two a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. Three a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. Three a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. Two, nine. Two a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. Three, a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. Three a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle, two. Nine. Two a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. Three a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. Three a-squig, a-squig, a-squiggle. Two, nine. And 15 all the way over to here. And now, Yeah. I can talk that fast totally. OK, But let's not get too far from your original purpose, which was to nicely fill a page with this squiggle. The nicest page filling squiggles have kind of the same density of squiggle everywhere. You don't want to be clumped up here, but have left over space there, because monsters may start growing in the left over space. On graph paper, you can be kind of precise about it. Say you want a squiggle that goes through every box exactly once, and can be extended infinitely. So you try some of those, and decide that, since the point of them is to fill up all the space, you call them space filling curves. Yeah, that's actually a technical term, but be careful because your curve might actually be a snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake-- Also, to make it neater, you draw the lines on the lines, and shift the rules so that you go through each intersection on the graph paper exactly once. Which is the same thing, as far as space is concerned. Here's a space filling curve that a guy named Hilbert made up, because Hilbert was awesome, but he's dead now. Here's the first iteration. For the second one, we're going to build it piece-by-piece by connecting four copies of the first. So here's one. Put the second space away next to it, and connect those. Then turn the page to put the third sideways under the first, and connect those. And then the fourth will be the mirror image of that on the other side. Now you've got one nice curve. The third iteration will be made out of four copies of the second iteration. So first build another second iteration curve out of four copies of the first iteration-- one, two, three, four-- then put another next to it, then two sideways on the bottom. Connect them all up. There you go. The fourth iteration is made of four copies of the third iteration, the same way. If you learn to do the second iteration in one piece, it'll make this go faster. Then build two third iterations facing up next to each other, and two underneath sideways. You can keep going until you run out of room, or you can make each new version the same size by making each line half the length. Or you can make it out of snakes. Or if you have friends, you can each make an iteration of the same size, and put them together. Or invent your own fractal curve so that you could be cool like Hilbert. Who was like, mathematics? I'm going to invent meta-mathematics like a boss.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_vi-hart
" -  In this video, we're going to see if we can compute what three divided by 0.75 is equal to, and I'll give you a little bit of a hint before I tell you to pause the video. So let's imagine three wholes right over here, and what if we were to think of these three wholes, these three ones, and what if we were to think about them in terms of hundredths? Well then we could, once we express these as hundredths, we could say, well how many groups of 75 hundredths can we divide this into? How many equal groups of 75 hundredths? To help you think about that, here's a little bit of a visualization where three is divided into equal groups of 75 hundredths. So pause this video and use what I have, this little visual here, as a big hint to figure out what three divided by 75/100 is. All right, now let's do it together. So as I said, we started with three ones, or three wholes, however you want to think about it, and you could divide division by 75/100 as saying, well how many equal groups of 75 hundredths can you divide these three wholes into? And so we thought about these three wholes in terms of hundredths, and the way it's been color coded, it actually has already been divided into four equal groups of 75 hundredths. You can count these, so this is 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and then five hundredths. So this right over here, this is one group of 75 hundredths. Then in green you have another group of 75 hundredths. So you have 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and then 75, so that right over, let me use a color I can see. This right over here is our second group. This is our first group right over there. Then that's our third group, these are all equal groups of 75 hundredths, and that's our fourth equal group of 75 hundredths in the green again. So how many equal groups of 75 hundredths can you divide three wholes into? Well, clearly it is equal to four.",math_cc-fifth-grade-math_divide-decimals
" Find the slope of the linear function defined by the table. And they give us a table here. They define certain amount, I guess these are shift lengths, and then they say how many hours is a half a day, is a full day, is two days, is a week, is a month. And then they tell us how much money do we make in each of those time periods. If we work four hours, we make $54, if we work eight hours, we make $108, so forth and so on. And then they say what does the slope represent in this situation? So we have to find the slope and figure out what it represents. So just as a bit of review, slope just equals the change in the dependent variable divided by the change in the independent variable. So how much does a dependent variable change for any amount of change of the independent variable? In this situation, the dependent variable is the amount of money you make because it is dependent on how much time you work, this is independent. So let's call the independent variable x, the dependent variable y. So our slope in this situation would be change in y divided by change in x. So how much does the amount of money I make change when I work a certain number of hours, when my hours worked change by a certain amount. So let's just take some data points here. We could take really any of these data points, I'll take some of the smaller numbers. So let's say if when I go from four to eight hours, so my change in x is going to be what? If I go from four to eight, might change in x is going to be eight minus four, four hours, right? So this is going to be my change in x. I'm just picking these two points, I could have picked four and forty if I wanted, but the math would become more complicated. But how much does the amount of money earn change if I go from four hours to eight hours? Well, I go from $54 to $108, so the difference in the amount of money I make is $108 minus $54. So what is my change in my dependent variable? Well, that's going to be $108 minus $54, that's just $54. And then what was the change in the amount of hours I worked? Well, the change in the hours I worked was four hours. So, if I work four more hours, I make 54 more dollars. Let me put a little equal sign there. So what is 54 divided by four? So four goes into 54-- looks like there's going to be decimal here-- four goes into five one time, one times four is four. Subtract, you get five minus four is one, bring down this four you get 14. Four goes into 14 three times, three times four is 12. Fourteen minus 12 is two, bring down a 0 right here, four goes into 20 five times. And of course you have this decimal right here. Five times four is 20. Subtract, no remainder. So this is equal to 13.5, but since we're talking in terms of dollars, maybe say $13.50, because that's our numerator, right? This is money earned, dollars per hour, because that's our denominator, dollars per hour. So that essentially answers our question. What does the slope represent in this situation? It represents the hourly wage for working at wherever this might be. Frankly, for this problem, you didn't even have to take two data points. We could have said hey, if you work four hours and make $54, 54 divided by four is 13.50. Or we could have said hey, if we work eight hours, we get $108, 108 divided by eight is 13.50. So you didn't even have to take two data points here, you could have just taken any of these numbers divided by any of these numbers. But hopefully we also learned a little bit about what slope is.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-linear-equations-functions
" Let's say you're some type of traffic engineer and what you're trying to figure out is, how many cars pass by a certain point on the street at any given point in time? And you want to figure out the probabilities that a hundred cars pass or 5 cars pass in a given hour. So a good place to start is just to define a random variable that essentially represents what you care about. So let's say the number of cars that pass in some amount of time, let's say, in an hour. And your goal is to figure out the probability distribution of this random variable and then once you know the probability distribution then you can figure out what's the probability that 100 cars pass in an hour or the probability that no cars pass in an hour and you'd be unstoppable. And just a little aside, just to move forward with this video, there's two assumptions we need to make because we're going to study the Poisson distribution. And in order to study it's there's two assumptions we have to make. That Poisson hour at this point on the street is no different than any other hour. And we know that that's probably false. During rush hour in a real situation you probably would have more cars than at another rush hour. And you know, if you wanted to be more realistic maybe we do it in the day because in a day any period of time-- actually, no. I shouldn't do a day. We have to assume that every hour is completely just like any other hour and actually, even within the hour there's really no differentiation from one second to the other in terms of the probabilities that a car arrives. That's a little bit of a simplifying assumption that might not truly apply to traffic, but I think we can make that assumption. And then the other assumption we need to make is that if a bunch of cars pass in one hour that doesn't mean that fewer cars will pass in the next. That in no way does the number of cars that pass in one period affect or correlate or somehow influence the number of cars that pass in the next. That they're really independent. Given that, we can then at least try using the skills we have to model out some type of a distribution. The first thing you do and I'd recommend doing this for any distribution is maybe we can estimate the mean. Let's sit out on that curb and measure what this variable is over a bunch of hours and then average it up, and that's going to be a pretty good estimator for the actual mean of our population. Or, since it's a random variable, the expected value of this random variable. Let's say you do that and you get your best estimate of the expected value of this random variable is-- I'll use the letter lambda. You know, this could be 9 cars per hour. You sat out there-- it could be 9.3 cars per hour. You sat out there over hundreds of hours and you just counted the number of cars each hour and you averaged them all up. You said, on average, there are 9.3 cars per hour and you feel that's a pretty good estimate. So that's what you have there. And let's see what we could do. We know the binomial distribution. The binomial distribution tells us that the expected value of a random variable is equal to the number of trials that that random variable's kind of composed of, right? Before, in the previous videos we were counting the number of heads in a coin toss. So this would be the number of coin tosses, times the probability of success over each toss. This is what we did with the binomial distribution. So maybe we can model our traffic situation something similar. This is the number of cars that pass in an hour. So maybe we could say lambda cars per hour is equal to-- I don't know. Let's make each experiment or each toss of the coin equal to whether a car passes in a given minute. So there are 60 minutes per hour, so there would be 60 trials. And then, the probability that we have success in each of those trials, if we modeled this as a binomial distribution would be lambda over 60 cars per minute. And this would be a probability. This would be n, and this would be the probability, if we said that this is a binomial distribution. And this probably wouldn't be that bad of an approximation. If you actually then said, oh, this is a binomial distribution, so the probability that our random variable equals some given value, k. You know, the probability that 3 cars, exactly 3 cars pass in an given hour, we would then be equal to n. So n would be 60. Choose k, and you know, I have 3 cars times the probability of success. So the probability that a car passes in any minute. So it'd be lambda over 60 to the number of successes we need. So to the kth power, times the probability of no success or that no cars pass, to the n minus k. If we have k successes we have to have 60 minus k failures. There are 60 minus k minutes where no car passed. This actually wouldn't be that bad of an approximation where you have 60 intervals and you say this is a binomial distribution. And you'd probably get reasonable results. But there's a core issue here. In this model where we model it as a binomial distribution, what happens if more than one car passes in an hour? Or more than one car passes in a minute? The way we have it right now we call it a success if one car passes in a minute. And if you're kind of counting it counts as one success, even if 5 cars pass in that minute. So you say, oh, OK Sal, I know the solution there. I just have to get more granular. Instead of dividing it into minutes why don't I divide it into seconds? So the probability that I have k successes-- instead of 60 intervals I'll do 3,600 intervals. So the probability of k successful seconds, so a second where a car is passing at that moment out of 3,600 seconds. So that's 3,600 choose k, times the probability that a car passes in any given second. That's the expected number of cars in an hour divided by number seconds in an hour. We're going to have k successes. And these are the failures, the probability of a failure and you're going to have 3,600 minus k failures. And this would be even a better approximation. This actually would not be so bad, but still, you have this situation where 2 cars can come within a half a second of each other. And you say, oh, OK Sal, I see the pattern here. We just have to get more and more granular. We have to just make this number larger and larger and larger. And your intuition is correct. And if you do that you'll end up getting the Poisson distribution. And this is really interesting because a lot of times people give you the formula for the Poisson distribution and you can kind of just plug in the numbers and use it. But it's neat to know that it really is just the binomial distribution and the binomial distribution really did come from kind of the common sense of flipping coins. That's where everything is coming from. But before we kind of prove that if we take the limit as-- let me change colors. Before we proved that as we take the limit as this number right here, the number of intervals approaches infinity that this becomes the Poisson distribution. I'm going to make sure we have a couple of mathematical tools in our belt. So the first is something that you're probably reasonably familiar with by now, but I just want to make sure that the limit as x approaches infinity of 1 plus a/x to the x power is equal to e to the ax-- no sorry. Is equal to e to the a and now just to prove this to you, let's make a little substitution here. Let's say that n is equal to-- let me say 1 over n is equal to a over x. And then what would be x would equal to na. x times 1 is equal to n times a. And so the limit as x approaches infinity, what does a approach? a is-- sorry. As x approaches infinity what does n approach? Well n is x divided by a. So n would also approach infinity. So this thing would be the same thing as just making our substitution the limit as n approaches infinity of 1 plus-- a/x, I made the substitution as 1/n. And x is, by this substitution, n times a. And this is going to be the same thing as the limit as n approaches infinity of 1 plus 1/n to the n, all of that to the a. And since there's no n out here we could just take the limit of this and then take that to the a power. So that's going to be equal to the limit as n approaches infinity of 1 plus 1/n to the nth power, all of that to the a. And this is our definition, or one of the ways to get to e if you'd watch the videos on compound interest and all that. This is how we got to e. And if you tried it out on your calculator, just try larger and larger n's here and you'll get e. This inner part is equal to e, and we raised it to the a power, so it's equal to e to the a. So hopefully you pretty satisfied that this limit is equal to e to the a. And then one other tool kit I want in our belt, and I'll probably actually do the proof in the next video. The other tool kit is to recognize that x factorial over x minus k factorial is equal to x times x minus 1 times x minus 2, all the way down to times x minus k plus 1. And we've done this a lot of times, but this is the most abstract we've ever written it. I can give you a couple of-- and just so you know, they'll be exactly k terms here. 1, 2, 3-- So first term, second term, third term, all the 1way, and this the kth term. 1And this is important to our derivation of the 1Poisson distribution. 1But just to make this in real numbers, if I had 7 factorial 1over 7 minus 2 factorial, that's equal to 7 times 6 1times 5 times 4 times 3 times 3 times 1. 1Over 2 times-- no sorry. 17 minus 2, this is 5. 1So it's over 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1. 1These cancel out and you just have 7 times 6. 1And so it's 7 and then the last term is 7 minus 12 plus 1, which is 6. 1In this example, k was 2 and you had exactly 2 terms. 1So once we know those two things we're now ready 1to derive the Poisson distribution and I'll do 1that in the next video. 1See you soon.",math_statistics-probability_random-variables-stats-library
" -  So let's think about something a little bit. What do you think 17 divided by two is going to be? Well, you might immediately realize that it's not obvious what you need to multiply two by in order to get to 17. There's no whole number that I could put here that gets us to 17. We know that two times, let's see, two times eight is a little bit less than that. Two times eight is equal to 16. And we know that two times nine is going to be a little bit more than that, is equal to 18. And so this question mark, two times question mark is equal to 17. This helps us know that our question mark, our unknown value here is going to be between eight and nine. It is going to be eight point something. So let's do another example. If someone were to ask you, hey, let's think about 18 divided by four. And you don't have to figure out exactly what it is just yet, but I want you to think about what two consecutive whole numbers is 18 divided by four, whatever that is, what is that between? Well, we could do something similar. We could say, all right, let's see, four times four is equal to 16, so that doesn't quite get us to 18. We could say that four times five is equal to 20, so that's more than 18. So four times question mark is equal to 18. This helps us realize that because 18 is between 16 and 20, this question mark right over here is going to be between four and five. So 18 divided by four is going to be four point something. Now, another way of thinking about or estimating what division might result in is through an inequality. So if I were to say 87 divided by nine, how would you compare that to 10 over here? So there's a couple of ways you could compare it. You could say, hey, maybe this is greater than 10. Maybe it's equal to 10. Maybe it is less than 10. So pause this video and see if you can figure that out. What would you put here? Is it less than, greater than, or equal to 10? Well, we know it's not equal to 10. We know that 90 divided by nine is equal to 10. And let's see, if we go one multiple of nine less than that, we know that 81 divided by nine is equal to nine. And so 87 divided by nine is in between these two values. Let me do this in another color. So 87 divided by nine is going to be something in between nine and 10. And so it is going to be less than 10. So the whole point of this video is to start to get us a little bit comfortable with this idea of dividing where we might get an answer that is not a whole number. And in the future we'll learn how to compute that, but for now we're just learning to estimate and just get a sense of, hey, okay, this is going to be between eight and nine. This is going to be between four and five. This is going to be between nine and 10, which just means it's going to be nine point something, which means it's going to be less than 10.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_division
" -  Right here, we have 65 blocks. And you can count them if you like. But we can represent them with the number 65. By writing a six in the tens place, we're literally saying that we have six tens. And this is a 10, this is a 10, this is another 10, this is another 10, this is a 10, this is a 10, and this is a 10. We have six groups of ten and that makes 60. And then we have five ones. Five in that orange color. And then we have five ones. And you see them right here. One, two, three, four, five. Now let's do something inter... Well, actually, let me just first write that down again. Just to emphasize it. We can write down that 65, 65 is equal to six tens, six tens plus five ones. Plus five ones. Now, let's do something interesting. Let's start with 65, so let me write that down again, so we're gonna start with 65. I'm having trouble changing colors. We're gonna start with 65 and I'm gonna subtract... I'm going to subtract 40. I'm going to subtract 40 from that. What am I really doing here? Well, I'm starting with 65, I'm starting with this, and I'm subtracting four tens and zero ones. Let's subtract four tens from here. Let's subtract one, two, three, four. I took away four of the tens. How many tens do I have left over? Well, I have left over two tens. This is going to be equal to two tens. And how many ones do I have? Well, I still have five ones. So, I still... I still have five ones. And that makes sense. I had five ones, I took away zero ones, so I'm still going to have five ones. What is this going to be equal to? We can write 65. 65. Minus 40. Minus 40 is... Let me do the... I want to do the ones in that orange color. Minus 40 is equal to, another way of saying two tens is by putting a two in the tens place, and a... And then we have five ones. A five in the ones place. Two tens plus five ones, or 25.",math_early-math_cc-early-math-add-sub-100
" So in our previous video, we tested the launcher. And we noticed that, several times, the launcher threw the ball towards the left, and we wanted to see if we could straighten that out. So we took a look at some different key components. You can see those in red. We have our 5/16 stop pin or bolt and our PVC cradle that holds the ball. Now currently, what happens is you pull the bar back, and then the ball goes back with the bar. And then you release the bar, and the ball travels forward with the bar. And then the bar hits the stop, but the ball continues on. So what we wanted to see if we could do is remove the pin and the cradle. And one of the reasons is that the pin can potentially be a pinch point, and it also has the effect of building up stress in a very specific point on the aluminum bar there. And that stress can work harden the aluminum. It actually changes the crystalline structure of the metal over time and causes it to be more brittle and can eventually cause it to crack. And so we were going to see if we could launch the ball using the same kind of technique that a football kicker would use. So there would be a guy holding the tip of the ball in place, and the kicker would wind up and then kick the ball. And instead of the ball travelling with his foot, he would instantaneously contact the ball that's being held in a certain point, and then the ball would release. So we thought it might be interesting to design a device that could hold the ball in place, like the guy that holds the ball in place for a kicker. So we thought maybe we could take a paper clip and bend it to create a device, shown in purple here, to hold the ball in place. And then we could remove the cradle and the stop pin and maybe improve the accuracy and longevity of wear and maybe even the safety of the device. So we started with the ball. We put it in its location. Then we took a needle-nose pliers and a paper clip and started bending the paper clip to create a larger loop at the top and a smaller loop at the bottom. The overall paper clip shape is a C shape when you look at it from the front of the device. And so it took a little while to figure out exactly where to position it, and we drilled a hole in the side of the wood and put a panhead wood screw in there to hold the paper clip in place. And then we put a little loop at the bottom and put another screw there to just ensure that the paperclip would be nice and secure. And so once we had the paper clip in place and it was connected, we put the ball in and tried to make sure it was lined up correctly so that the launcher would hit it. And at this point in time, we still have the PVC on there. We're still looking at experimenting with the PVC. We will eventually remove that because it, with the paper clip, ended up causing the ball to launch to the side. So we'll do a quick launch here and just check it out. So we decided to do some field tests, and we recorded the distances and the height and the different angles and positions that we launched the ball at. And we did this a number of times. We had a little sand trap set up so we could see exactly where the ball had landed, and then we recorded that and tried to figure out if we could improve the launcher in any other ways. And we noticed that there were a couple of opportunities for improvement, so we went back to our drawing and made some adaptations. Finally, we were looking at our design, and we discovered that, as we launched at steeper and steeper angles, like right here, when we're setting the device at steeper angles-- at 50 and 60 and 70 and 80 degrees-- the top section of the device tended to fall backwards or lean backwards. And so when we were launching the ping-pong ball, it was hard to reliably launch it without that top part moving. The other thing we noticed is that we wanted to grab the launcher to stabilize it, and we tended to want to grab it right here, which is great except for the fact that when the aluminum bar swings back, it can smack your hand on this part right here. So we wanted to make sure that that wasn't going to be a possibility, and we wanted to find a way to keep this top piece down. So what we decided to do was to create these features. So we have a bolt that we've cut a little bit short. It goes right here. It's a 5/16 bolt. And we have a nylon sleeve that goes around it, and that keeps the launching apparatus or the top piece from coming back or leaning back when it's at a steep angle. And then we used 1/2-inch plywood to create a cover for the spring assembly area. And we cut a hole out in it so you can still access that bolt if you need to loosen or tighten it, and cut a half a hole here to do the same with this bolt. But this way, you can pull the launcher back, and there's no chance of any kind of being pinched or caught in any way. And so those are the main innovations on the launcher there. So now I'm going to spin it around so you can take a look at it from a number of different angles. You can see there are one, two, three, four main pieces of wood that hold the cover in place, and then we have our bolt there with the sleeve. OK, so now we're going to see what we can do to improve the launcher and make those changes. You can already see the bolt with the sleeve is in place there to prevent the launcher from coming back too far. And now we're going to measure the top part of the cover that's going to go over the spring assembly. That'll be 6 and 1/2 inches wide, and then we've got a 1-inch spade bit that we're going to use to drill out the holes for the bolts. So that's the center bolt and the spring bolt. And so now we're just marking the positions. We're drilling those bolt holes out and cleaning that off. And we're going to set our fence up, and that fence will allow us to use the circular saw to cut a nice straight edge. And we use the piece of wood there to make sure that the fence didn't interfere with the clamps. So now we're just trimming it down to the right length and cleaning off the edges with a file. And now what we've done is we're cutting the side pieces. Those are an inch and 3/4 high, and they go all the way around the edge of that box. And we're cleaning those pieces off. And they're 6 and 1/2 inches wide. Then there's one piece that's 13 inches wide, and that's the piece that runs along the long edge. And so now we're just clamping those in place. We've already marked them 3/8 of an inch up. We're drilling our holes with a 1/16-inch drill bit. And now we're just putting inch and 1/2 panhead wood screws in. And we screwed our top piece on already, and now we're going to put the bottom piece on. And just lining that up, using the clamps to hold it in place, and again, 3/8 of an inch up. And we're just putting those screws in. Now we're going to go ahead and put the top part on. And we're, again, pre-drilling all those holes and using our panhead wood screws, putting them in. So we have everything lined up. The hole in the center wasn't as clean as we like, so I'm going to take a Dremel and go back and clean that hole up, make it a little bit smoother so that it's sure that we're out of the way of the bolt below. So I'm going to take the cover back off, and we're going to assemble the hardware inside the device again. So you've seen us do that before, so that's not anything really new. We're just tightening down our bolts and making sure everything is secure. And then we're going to tighten down all the screws for the new cover on the launcher and make sure that it works. Now we're shortening the bolt that we need, which was that little green bolt that was in the drawing, and cleaning it off with a file. So that's just going to make sure that the major piece doesn't fold back when it's at a steep angle, and so that's the part right there. And there's the original bolt down below. We've got our paper clip that holds the ball in place and keeps everything lined up, and again, we've got our countersunk holes. We can drop the device completely flat. And I'll just turn it around here for you so you can see all of the different components and how it looks and works together. And we'll set that angle bolt in, and then we'll put the other bolt and its sleeve in place. And so now we're going to test fire it. Put a ping-pong ball in, and we got a successful launch. So now we're going to go test it in the field. So we've got our projectile launcher set up, and we have our numbers indicating the height on the back in the black plastic there. And then we have our tape measure, so we can measure how far it goes, or our range. Initially, we're going to set at position 4, which is the fourth position back from horizontal, and angle 20-- so 20 degrees. And you can see where the ball lands out there. We went out and measured it in the sand. The sand lets us see where the ball landed. So we're at 30 degrees and the same position-- so the fourth position down. And now we're at 40 degrees-- again, seeing that the ball is going up higher. Now we're at 50 degrees, and again, the ball keeps going higher. And the range of the ball is decreasing, and the height is increasing. And so now we're at 60 degrees. And as we go higher and higher, the ball tends to veer off a little bit. Now we're at 70 degrees, same position. The ball completely goes out of the screen, and again, it's not quite as far away. 1And now we're at 80 degrees. 1So we're going to take a look at precisely measuring exactly how 1high the ball goes. 1The sand measures our range, and we can slow the film down 1and see that the ball went just below 3 feet. 1The top of the paper is exactly 3 feet, 1so the ball was about 2 feet 10 inches on that particular shot. 1So we're going to try another one. 1And on that one, again, it was at 20 degrees, position 4. 1We can see the ball goes to about 3 feet 14 inches on that particular shot. 1So that allows us to see the height, 1and we can use that in our calculations. 1Now we're going to see if we can use this information 1to knock down a tower of cups. 1So we've got it all set up. 1This is position 4, 20 degrees. 1Yeah. 1Only three tries.",science_physics_discoveries
" - Hormones, those things that make teenagers moody and miserable and they cause growth spurts and acne and they make a perfectly normal student totally obsessed with his algebra teacher, not that I have any real boots on the ground experience with that last one. But all that mayhem is just the handiwork of your sex hormones. The fact is that there are more than 50 different kinds of hormones coursing through you right now, and all multi-cellular organisms produce one kind or another. For instance, hormones regulate the process of metamorphosis in insects, they're what stimulate plants to grow and fruits to ripen. In animals, the network that makes and releases hormones, your endocrine system, is one of the two ways, along with the nervous system, that important information is communicated from one part of your body to another. Right now, your endocrine system is spraying hormones into your bloodstream that are doing all kinds of things all over your body, giving instructions to other glands, regulating the levels of salt and sugar and water in your blood, telling your heart to beat faster. And yes, they're partly responsible for that daydream you may or may not be having about Taylor Lautner right now. But keep your eye on the prize here. We're doing science, pay attention. The endocrine system and the nervous system both carry information around the body, but while the nervous system carries information really quickly and the responses are usually short-lived, endocrine responses take a while to get going but their effects can last for hours or even weeks. The word hormone comes from the Greek for to arouse activity, and they're secreted by endocrine glands, the series of organs that also manufacture them. In addition to endocrine glands, you also have exocrine glands like salivary glands and sweat glands. As you can tell by the name, they send stuff outside of the body, whereas endocrines keep the crines, which is Greek for secretions, in. And your glands are all over the freaking place. Some of the heaviest hitters are in your brain, but you also have them in your throat, right over your kidneys, right below your stomach, and of course in your baby-making areas. All glands have blood vessels coming from them so that the hormones that they release can get into the bloodstream fast. And many of your hormones circulate through your whole body, only binding to the cells that have the right receptor proteins that fit them. But there are some hormone-driven messaging systems that are more localized. For instance, paracrine signaling releases hormone molecules that degrade really quickly and are only received in a small region of the body. Example, testosterone, manufactured by the testes, tells the testes how many sperm they need to be making right this second. And to see hormones work on an even smaller scale, get a load of autocrine signaling, which sends chemical signals within a cell or from one cell to the adjacent cell at most. This is what happens in your immune system, when a single T-cell realizes it needs to start cloning itself so it can fight off a virus. Your cells receive hormones through signal receptors, but how and where a hormone binds to its receptor depends on what kind of hormone it is. There are three different types. There's the steroids which do a lot more than make your muscles big and get you all angry and stuff. Steroids are derived from cholesterol, and there's a bunch of different types of them. There are peptides, which are just chains of amino acids, and monoamines, which are based on a single amino acid. The only really important thing we need to keep straight about these is the peptide and amine hormones are water-soluble and don't dissolve in lipids, and since cell membranes are made of lipids, those hormones can't pass into a cell. Instead, they bind with receptors that are on the surface of the cell. But steroids are lipid-soluble, so they're able to penetrate the membrane and bind with the receptors in the cell's nucleus. Using these methods, the endocrine system sends out all kinds of important chemical bulletins, many of which start up in the brain in a tiny, tiny gland about the size of a pea, the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland, it's the master gland, the Napoleon of the endocrine system, except that Napoleon actually wasn't very small. That's a myth. But you get what I'm saying. The pituitary gland makes hormones that instruct other glands to make other hormones, and those hormones actually get the real legwork done. The pituitary is connected to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that acts as the liaison between the nervous system and the endocrine system. So a big part of its job is to tell your glands what to do based on information it gets from your senses and other nerve functions. For example, breastfeeding women will start releasing milk when their baby starts crying. Sensory information, in this case auditory, comes to the hypothalamus from the nervous system, telling it that there's a little snuggle of baby nearby that might be hungry. This causes the hypothalamus to nudge the pituitary gland, which in turn releases hormones that stimulate milk production and secretion. Pretty cool. The pituitary gland sits directly underneath the hypothalamus and has two lobes, which are actually two different glands fused together. The posterior pituitary is an extension of the hypothalamus and it secretes two hormones that are actually made by the hypothalamus. One of them is oxytocin, which stimulates contraction of the uterus during childbirth and helps with breastfeeding. But it probably also has a role in things like social recognition, pair bonding, orgasms, and anxiety, which is interesting and weird. And the other hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary is antidiuretic hormone, which tells the kidneys to retain water. The anterior pituitary, on the other hand, both manufactures and secretes a whole battery of hormones, and one of the places these hormones end up is the thyroid. The thyroid regulates your metabolism, your appetite, muscle function, blood pressure, heart rate, among other things, and the way that it interacts with the pituitary is a good example of a negative feedback loop, a method of communication that's common all over the body and especially in the endocrine system. Basically, the pituitary is like the thyroid's thermostat. It can read how much thyroid hormone is in your bloodstream, and when its levels are low, it spits out a tiny bit of thyroid stimulating hormone or TSH, which travels to the thyroid. The thyroid in turn secretes thyroid hormone, which boosts our metabolism, and that increase in metabolism tells the pituitary to stop sending out TSH. So the effect of the pituitary secretion is a signal to secrete less of it, and that's a negative feedback. Other glands that are controlled by his royal highness, the pituitary gland, include adrenal glands. These guys sit right on top of the kidneys and are in charge of making hormones that help the kidneys maintain the level of salt and water in your body, but they also, you may have heard, respond to stress. Want to see how it works? Well, let's say you're walking down the street, minding your own business, and you get hit in the face by an angry duck. Let's say that this is unusual for you, and you don't know what's going on, just that you're being attacked by something. As soon as the sympathetic nervous system senses that something potentially dangerous is happening, the hypothalamus tells the pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone or ACTH for those of us who don't have all freaking day. This stimulates the adrenal glands to make epinephrine, also known as adrenaline. Now, the epinephrine in your bloodstream will tell a bunch of different organs to do a bunch of different things all at once. Cut off blood supply to your digestive system, send a bunch of blood to your lungs and muscles and speed up your heart rate, all to help you on your quest to vanquish this dastardly drake. And like pretty much every other muscle contraction in your body, your heart is controlled by the endocrine system as well as your nervous system. You may have noticed that after a scare, your heart races for a couple minutes afterwards. That's because the epinephrine is still in your bloodstream telling your heart to race like crazy, even after you're no longer in mortal danger or whatever. Alright, I know you're wondering when we're gonna get to the gonads, but let me warm you up first with the function of your pancreas, super sexy gland, the biggest in the body. I've mentioned a couple times that glands regulate the balance of solutes in your blood. This is one of the most important things that the endocrine system does, and no one does it better than your pancreas because its job is to regulate the levels of glucose in your blood. And since glucose is what makes cellular respiration and therefore your life possible, this is important. When the concentration of blood glucose rises, say after you eat a couple of Ho Hos, the pancreas secretes insulin into the blood, the insulin then travels around your body and stimulates pretty much every type of body cell to absorb glucose. Liver and muscle cells convert the glucose to glycogen for storage, and other cells in the connective tissue called adipose cells convert the glucose into fat. But if your blood sugar's too low, your pancreas has got your back there too. Say you're in a push-up contest with Christian Bale, you're going to lose, but you're going to try. And the trying is going to require quite a lot of energy. Your friendly pancreas will release another hormone, glucagon, which stimulates the liver and muscles to start the process that breaks up the glycogen and fat to release the glucose so that you can lose to Christian Bale but losing to Christian Bale is better than winning against most people. Alright, so now that we're back to muscular men, let's get back to everybody's favorite topic, the gonads. Sex glands come in two different fla, that's not the right word, flavors, that's bad. Okay, whatever, we're just gonna go with it. There's the testes and there's the ovaries. They get instructions from the pituitary gland to make sex hormones. The testes make androgens, the main one of these being testosterone, which helps with sperm making among other things. Ovaries make estrogens and progestins, which stimulate the growth of the uterine lining and does some other stuff. Like what other stuff? Well, you might think that your biological sex is determined by the parts that you have, but that's only kinda true. It turns out that why we're either male or female has a lot to do with hormones. And someone get me a chair so I can tell you how we know that. Back in the 1940s, French embryologist Alfred Jost was studying sex differentiation in bunnies because that's what you do when you're a French embryologist in the 1940s apparently. He wondered whether the hormones secreted by the gonads during embryonic development had anything to do with whether a bunny embryo turned out to be a boy or a girl. So he very carefully, very, very carefully, and this is a little disturbing, removed bunny embryos from their mother and then also very carefully removed the part that would become the ovaries or the testes from the bunny embryos and then also very carefully he put the embryos back in the mama rabbit. What Jost found after the bunnies were born was that the ones that he performed the surgery on turned out to be girls. So in the absence of gonads and therefore hormones that specifically instructed the development of testes and the growth of a pee-pee and a deep bunny voice, he discovered that the default setting for mammalian embryos is make it female. So sex hormones are hard at work even during fetal development to make us who we are, 1but they're super hard at work during puberty, 1when the pituitary gland puts the gonads on red alert. 1In boys, telling the testes to make a whole lot of androgens 1like testosterone that lower the voice, 1make a bunch of hair, increase muscle and bone mass, 1and encourage people to do stupid stunts 1and post them on YouTube. 1In girls, estrogens, the most important ones being 1estradiol, and progestins like progesterone 1kick off the process of menstruation and breast growth 1and all that good stuff, 1largely helping the female body get ready to grow 1and nurse a baby. 1But what we still don't understand very well 1is how sex hormones affect our emotions. 1We do know, for example, that estrogen is required 1for the manufacture of serotonin, 1the neurotransmitter that gives us a sense of 1calm and well-being. 1So when estrogen levels drop quickly 1during a woman's menstrual cycle, 1it can make her feel off-kilter. 1But the effects of sex hormones not just on our bodies 1but our minds remains a significant mystery, 1which is good because I don't want to even go there.",science_biology_crash-course-bio-ecology
"Welcome back.  Current transcript segment: Welcome back. Welcome back. I'll now do another conservation of energy problem, and this time I'll add another twist. So far, everything we've been doing, energy was conserved by the law of conservation. But that's because all of the forces that were acting in these systems were conservative forces. And now I'll introduce you to a problem that has a little bit of friction, and we'll see that some of that energy gets lost to friction. And we can think about it a little bit. Well where does that energy go? And I'm getting this problem from the University of Oregon's zebu.uoregon.edu.  And they seem to have some nice physics problems, so I'll use theirs. And I just want to make sure they get credit. So let's see. They say a 90 kilogram bike and rider. So the bike and rider combined are 90 kilograms. So let's just say the mass is 90 kilograms. Start at rest from the top of a 500 meter long hill. OK, so I think they mean that the hill is something like this. So if this is the hill, that the hypotenuse here is 500 hundred meters long. So the length of that, this is 500 meters. A 500 meter long hill with a 5 degree incline. So this is 5 degrees.  And we can kind of just view it like a wedge, like we've done in other problems. There you go. That's pretty straight. OK. Assuming an average friction force of 60 newtons. OK, so they're not telling us the coefficient of friction and then we have to figure out the normal force and all of that. They're just telling us, what is the drag of friction? Or how much is actually friction acting against this rider's motion? We could think a little bit about where that friction is coming from. So the force of friction is equal to 60 newtons And of course, this is going to be going against his motion or her motion. And the question asks us, find the speed of the biker at the bottom of the hill. So the biker starts up here, stationary. That's the biker. My very artful rendition of the biker. And we need to figure out the velocity at the bottom. This to some degree is a potential energy problem.  It's definitely a conservation of mechanical energy problem. So let's figure out what the energy of the system is when the rider starts off. So the rider starts off at the top of this hill. So definitely some potential energy. And is stationary, so there's no kinetic energy. So all of the energy is potential, and what is the potential energy? Well potential energy is equal to mass times the acceleration of gravity times height, right? Well that's equal to, if the mass is 90, the acceleration of gravity is 9.8 meters per second squared. And then what's the height? Well here we're going to have to break out a little trigonometry. We need to figure out this side of this triangle, if you consider this whole thing a triangle. Let's see. We want to figure out the opposite. We know the hypotenuse and we know this angle here. So the sine of this angle is equal to opposite over hypotenuse. So, SOH. Sine is opposite over hypotenuse. So we know that the height-- so let me do a little work here-- we know that sine of 5 degrees is equal to the height over 500. Or that the height is equal to 500 sine of 5 degrees. And I calculated the sine of 5 degrees ahead of time. Let me make sure I still have it. That's cause I didn't have my calculator with me today. But you could do this on your own. So this is equal to 500, and the sine of 5 degrees is 0.087. So when you multiply these out, what do I get? I'm using the calculator on Google actually. 500 times sine. You get 43.6. So this is equal to 43.6. So the height of the hill is 43.6 meters. So going back to the potential energy, we have the mass times the acceleration of gravity times the height. Times 43.6. And this is equal to, and then I can use just my regular calculator since I don't have to figure out trig functions anymore. So 90-- so you can see the whole thing-- times 9.8 times 43.6 is equal to, let's see, roughly 38,455. So this is equal to 38,455 joules or newton meters. And that's a lot of potential energy. So what happens? At the bottom of the hill-- sorry, I have to readjust my chair-- at the bottom of the hill, all of this gets converted to, or maybe I should pose that as a question. Does all of it get converted to kinetic energy? Almost. We have a force of friction here. And friction, you can kind of view friction as something that eats up mechanical energy. These are also called nonconservative forces because when you have these forces at play, all of the force is not conserved. So a way to think about it is, is that the energy, let's just call it total energy. So let's say total energy initial, well let me just write initial energy is equal to the energy wasted in friction-- I should have written just letters-- from friction plus final energy. So we know what the initial energy is in this system. That's the potential energy of this bicyclist and this roughly 38 and 1/2 kilojoules or 38,500 joules, roughly. And now let's figure out the energy wasted from friction, and the energy wasted from friction is the negative work that friction does. And what does negative work mean? Well the bicyclist is moving 500 meters in this direction. So distance is 500 meters. But friction isn't acting along the same direction as distance. The whole time, friction is acting against the distance. So when the force is going in the opposite direction as the distance, your work is negative.  So another way of thinking of this problem is energy initial is equal to, or you could say the energy initial plus the negative work of friction, right? If we say that this is a negative quantity, then this is equal to the final energy. And here, I took the friction and put it on the other side because I said this is going to be a negative quantity in the system. And so you should always just make sure that if you have friction in the system, just as a reality check, that your final energy is less than your initial energy. Our initial energy is, let's just say 38.5 kilojoules. What is the negative work that friction is doing? Well it's 500 meters. And the entire 500 meters, it's always pushing back on the rider with a force of 60 newtons. So force times distance. So it's minus 60 newtons, cause it's going in the opposite direction of the motion, times 500. And this is going to equal the ending, oh, no. This is going to equal the final energy, right? And what is this? 60 times 500, that's 3,000. No, 30,000, right. So let's subtract 30,000 from 38,500. So let's see. Minus 30. I didn't have to do that. I could have done that in my head. So that gives us 8,455 joules is equal to the final energy. And what is all the final energy? Well by this time, the rider's gotten back to, I guess we could call the sea level. So all of the energy is now going to be kinetic energy, right? What's the formula for kinetic energy? It's 1/2 mv squared. And we know what m is. The mass of the rider is 90. So we have this is 90. So if we divide both sides. So the 1/2 times 90. That's 45. So 8,455 divided by 45. So we get v squared is equal to 187.9. And let's take the square root of that and we get the velocity, 13.7. So if we take the square root of both sides of this, so the final velocity is 13.7. I know you can't read that. 13.7 meters per second. And this was a slightly more interesting problem because here we had the energy wasn't completely conserved. Some of the energy, you could say, was eaten by friction. And actually that energy just didn't disappear into a vacuum. It was actually generated into heat. And it makes sense. If you slid down a slide of sandpaper, your pants would feel very warm by the time you got to the bottom of that. But the friction of this, they weren't specific on where the friction came from, but it could have come from the gearing within the bike. It could have come from the wind. Maybe the bike actually skidded a little bit on the way down. I don't know. But hopefully you found that a little bit interesting. And now you can not only work with conservation of mechanical energy, but you can work problems where there's a little bit of friction involved as well. 1Anyway, I'll see you in the next video. 1",science_physics_work-and-energy
" In this video, we're going to hopefully understand why the exponential form of a complex number is actually useful. So let's say we want to solve the equation x to the third power is equal to 1. So we want to find all of the real and/or complex roots of this equation right over here. This is the same thing as x to the third minus 1 is equal to 0. So we're looking for all the real and complex roots of this. And there are ways to do this without exponential form of a complex number. But the technique we're going to see in this video could be applied if this was x to the fifth minus 1, or x to the 13th minus 1. And it's also going to show us the patterns that emerge when you start looking at things on an Argand diagram. So to do this, let's think about the exponential representation of 1. So let's just say z is equal to 1. 1 is a complex number. It's a real number. All real numbers are also complex numbers. They're a subset. They're in the complex plane. They just don't have an imaginary part. So let's draw this on an Argand diagram. So that's my real axis. This is my imaginary axis. And so this is the real. This is the imaginary. And if I wanted to represent z equals 1, it only has a real part. So let me just draw 1 all around. Negative 1. Negative 1. z looks like this. z would look like that, a position vector that just goes to 1, 0. One way to view it-- this is the same thing as equal to 1 plus 0i. Now, let's put this in exponential form. Well, its magnitude is pretty straightforward. The magnitude of z is just the length of this vector, or it's the absolute value of 1. That's just going to be 1. Now, what's the argument of z? What's the angle that this vector makes with the positive real axis? Well, it's on the positive real axis. It's a real number. So it has no angle. So the arg of z is 0. So that might not be too interesting so far. We just figured out that 1 is equal to 1 times e to the 0i. And this is kind of obvious. e to the 0-- this is just going to be 0. 0 times i is 0. e to the 0 is going to be 1, times 1 is equal to 1. Not a big deal there. But what is neat is that this argument-- you could view it as 0 radians, or you could go all the way around and add 2 pi to it and get to the same point. So the argument of our complex number-- or of the number 1, really-- could also be an angle of 2 pi, or an angle of 4 pi, or an angle of 6 pi, or an angle of 8 pi. So we can write 1 as 1 times e-- I won't write the 1 anymore-- 1 times e to the 2 pi i, or 1 times e to the 4 pi i. And the reason why this is interesting is then this equation right here can be written in multiple ways. It can be written as x to the third is equal to 1. It could be written as x to the third is equal to e to the 2 pi i. Or it could be written as x to the third is equal to e to the 4 pi i. And this is interesting, and we're going to see this in a second. Let's take both sides of all these equations to the one-third power to solve for x. So to the one-third. We're going to take that to the one-third. We're going to do that same thing over here. We're just taking everything to the one-third power to solve for the x's in each of these equations. To the one-third power. So this first equation over here becomes x is equal to 1 to the one-third power, which is just equal to 1. Now, what's the second equation become? This second equation-- x is equal to e to the-- well, this is going to be the 2 pi over 3, i power. And then this equation over here is going to be-- so x is going to be equal to-- obviously, the 3 to the one-third, that just becomes x to the 1. Let me do that same blue. x over here is going to be equal to e to the 4 pi over 3, i. So let's think about this for a little bit. What is this? So immediately, what's the argument here? So these are three different roots. Let me call this x1, x2, and x3. So these are three different numbers. One of the roots is 1. That's pretty clear over here. 1 is one of the cube roots of itself. But these are other numbers. And these are going to be complex numbers. So let's visualize these numbers a little bit. So what is the argument? The magnitude of x2 is still clearly 1. It's the coefficient out in front of the e. It's clearly 1. Let me do that same color. The magnitude of x3 is also clearly going to be 1. But what is the argument of x2? What is phi? What is the argument? Well, it's 2 pi over 3. So how would we draw x2? So the angle is 2 pi over 3. It's easier for me to visualize in degrees. So 2 pi is 360 degrees. 360 degrees divided by 3 is 120 degrees. So this is going to be-- 120 degrees is 60 short of-- so it's going to look like this. So this angle right here, its argument is going to be 120 degrees, which is the same thing as 2 pi over 3. And it's going to have the exact same length. So let me do it in the same color. So this is x1. So that is this green color right over here. x2 is this magenta one right over here. And they all have the same magnitude. So we really just rotate it. We rotate it 120 degrees. And what about x3? What's its argument? What's x3's argument? Its argument is 4 pi over 3. That's the same thing as 720 degrees over 3, if we were to put it into degrees. And so 3 goes into 720-- what is it? 240? 720. 240. Right. I should have known that. So 240 degrees-- we're going to go 180 degrees, and then go another 60 degrees. So it's going to be right over here. So let me draw it like this. It's going to be right over here. That angle right over there is 4 pi over 3 radians, which is equal to 240 degrees. And once again, it has the same magnitude. So what we just saw is when I take the cube roots of this real number, I'm essentially taking the entire-- I guess we could call it the entire circle or the entire 360 degrees or the entire 2 pi radians-- and I'm dividing it into three, essentially. This is one third. Then we have another 120 degrees. And then we have another 120 degrees. And so you see the pattern of where all of the roots are. And in case you're still not satisfied, you're just like, well, you said you would find complex roots. Yeah, I'm not used to this or this as actually being complex numbers. I actually want it to be in the form a plus bi-- we can easily figure it out from this right over here. So x2-- it's going to be equal to the cosine of 2 pi over 3 plus i times the sine of 2 pi over 3. And if you look at this over here, we can figure out what those things are going to be. This is the angle right over here. If this angle right over here is 60 degrees-- which it is, because this up here is 30 degrees-- the hypotenuse, or the length, is 1, then this over here is square root of 3 over 2. And then this distance right over here is negative 1/2. So x2 is going to be equal to-- cosine of 2 pi over 3 is-- negative 1/2. Did I do that right? Yep, negative 1/2, plus i times sine of 2 pi over 3. That's this height over here, which is square root of 3 over 2, i. So that's x2. And we could do the exact same thing with x3. x3 is going to be equal to its x value. Or I should say its real value is going to be the exact same thing. It's going to be negative 1/2. And then, its imaginary value, so this angle right over here-- this just from the negative real axis down 1to the vector-- is going to be negative 60 degrees. 1So this height right over here is 1going to be negative square root of 3 over 2. 1So it's negative 1/2 minus the square root of 3 over 2, i. 1So using this technique, we were able to find 1the three complex roots of 1. 1This is one of them. 1This is another one. 1And of course, 1 is one of them as well. 1Where did we do that? 11 is one of them as well. 1And you could use this exact same technique 1if we were finding the fourth roots. 1We would take the 2 pi radians, or the 360 degrees, 1and divide it into 4. 1And so it would actually be this. 1It would be i. 1It would be negative 1. 1And it would be negative i. 1And we know if you take i to the fourth, you get 1. 1If you take negative i to the fourth, you get 1. 1And if you take negative 1 to the fourth, you get 1. 1And if you take 1 to the fourth, you get 1. 1And so you can find the eighth roots of 1 1using this technique. 1Now, the other question that might be popping in your brain 1is, why did I stop at e to the 4 pi i? 1Why didn't I go on and say, well, 1this is equal to e to the 6 pi i and look for another root? 1And so if I did that, if I said x to the third-- let's say 1I wanted to find a fourth root here, maybe. 1x to the third is equal to e to the 6 pi i. 1And I take both sides of this equation 1to the one-third power. 1Taking this to the one third, I would get e to the 2 pi i. 1Well, what's e to the 2 pi i? e to the 2 pi 1i would just get us back to 1. 1So when I added 2 pi again, it just gets us back to this root 1again. 1If I took e to the 6 pi, if I took e to the 8 pi, 1I would get this root again. 1So you're going to get only three roots if you're 1finding the third roots of something. 1Anything beyond that, it just becomes redundant.",math_precalculus_complex
" I think we're now ready to get into the meat of the proof. In the last video, we said if we can just prove that each of these parts are equal to each other, we essentially have proven that that is equal to that. Because here in yellow is another way of writing the flux across the surface and here in green is another way of writing the triple integral over our region of the divergence of f. And what I'm going to do in this video and probably in the next video is prove that these two are equivalent to each other. And I'm going to prove it using the fact that our original region is a simple solid region, in particular is a Type 1 region. And then that's essentially going to be it because you can use the exact same argument and the fact that it is a Type 2 region to prove this, and the exact same argument and the fact that it is a Type 3 region to prove that. So I'm going to assume it's a Type 1, which I can. It's a Type 1, 2, and 3 region. So given the fact that it's Type 1, I'm now going to prove this relationship right over here. And then I'll leave it up to you to do the exact same argument with a Type 2 and a Type 3 region. So let's get going. So Type 1 region, just to remind ourselves, a Type 1 region is a region that is equal to the set of all x, y's and z's such that the xy pairs are a member of a domain in the xy plane, and z is bounded by two functions. z's lower bound is f1 of x and y. And that's going to be less than or equal to z. And z's upper bound, we can call it f2 of xy. And then let me close the set notation right over here. And let me just draw a general version of a Type 1 region. So let me draw my x, y, and z-axes. So this is my z-axis. This is my x-axis. And there is my y-axis. And so we might have a region D. So our region, I'll draw it as a little circle right over here. This is our region D. And for any xy in our region D, you can evaluate the function f. You can figure out an f1, I should say. So this might define an f1, which we can kind of imagine as a surface or a little thing that's at the bottom of a cylinder if you want. So every xy there, when you evaluate or when you figure out what the corresponding f1 of those points in this domain would be, you might get a surface that looks something like this. It doesn't have to be flat, but hopefully this gives the idea. It doesn't have to be completely flat. It can be curved or whatever else. But this just shows you that every xy, when you evaluate it right over here, it gets associated with a point, this lower bound surface right over here. And I'll draw a dotted line to show that it's only for the xy's in this domain. And then we have an upper bound surface that might be up here. Give me any xy. When I evaluate f2, I get this surface up here. And once again, they don't have to look the same. This could be like a dome or it could be slanted or who knows what it might be. But this will give you the general idea. And then z fills up the region. Remember, the region isn't just the surface of the figure, it's the entire volume inside of it. So when z varies between that surface and that surface, for any given xy in our domain, we fill up the entire region. So we can fill up this entire region. And this is the way I drew it. It looks like a cylinder, but it doesn't have to be a cylinder like this. And these two surfaces might touch each other, in which case there would be no side of the cylinder. They could be lumpier than this. They might be inclined in some way. But hopefully, this is a good generalization of a Type 1 region. Now, a Type 1 region, you can kind of think of it, it can be broken up into three parts. It can be broken up into surface-- or the surfaces of a Type 1 region, I should say, can be broken up into three parts. Let's call that surface one. Let's call this right over here surface two, the top of the cylinder or whatever kind of lumpy top it might be. And let's call the side, if these two surfaces don't touch each other, let's call that surface three. There might not necessarily even be a surface three if these two touch each other as in the case of the sphere. But let's just assume that there actually is a surface three. So if we're evaluating the surface integral-- we'll think about this triple integral in a second. But let's think about how we can rewrite this surface integral right over here. This entire surface is S1 plus S2 plus S3. So we can essentially break this up into three separate surface integrals. So let's do that. Just remember we're just focusing on this part right over here. So the surface integral of R times k dot n, the dot product of k and n, ds can be rewritten as the-- let me write it this way-- can be rewritten as the surface integral over S2 of R times k dot n ds, plus the surface integral-- I'm just breaking up the surface here-- plus the surface integral over S1 of R times k dot n ds plus the surface integral over surface three of the same thing, R times k dot n ds. Now, the way I've drawn it, and this is actually the case, S3 is if those surfaces don't touch each other. And for Type 1 situation right over here, the normal vector at any given point on the side of the cylinder for this Type 1 region-- if there is this in between region. There always isn't. In a sphere, there wouldn't be this surface, in which case this would be 0. But if there is this surface in a Type 1 region, the one that essentially connects the boundaries of the top and the bottom, then the normal vector will never have a k component. The normal vector will always be pointing flat out. It will only have an i and j component. So if you take this normal vector right over here does not have a k component and you're dotting it with a k vector, then the dot product of two things that are orthogonal, the k vector goes like that, you're going to get 0. So this thing is going to be 0 because k dot n is going to be 0 in this situation for this surface. k dot n is going to be equal to 0. So this part right over here simplifies to this right over here. Now in the next video what we can do is essentially express these in terms of surface integrals, but in terms of double integrals over this domain right over here. We'll kind of evaluate these surface integrals.",math_multivariable-calculus_greens-theorem-and-stokes-theorem
" We're asked to name an angle adjacent to angle BGD. So angle BGD, let's see if we can pick it out. So here is B, here is G, and here is D, right over here. So angle BGD is this entire angle right over here. So when we talk about adjacent angles, we're talking about an angle that has one of its rays in common. So for example, angle AGB has one of the rays in common, it has GB in common with angle BGD. So we could say angle AGB, which could obviously also be called angle BGA, BGA and AGB are both this angle right over here. You could also go with angle FGB, because that also has GB in common. So you go angle FGB, which could also be written as angle BGF. Or you could go over here, angle EGD shares ray GD in common. So you could do this angle right over here, angle EGD. Or you could go all the way out here, angle FGD. These last two sharing ray GD in common. So any one of these responses would satisfy the question of just naming an angle, just naming one. Let's do this next one. Name an angle vertical to angle EGA. So this is this angle right over here. And the way you think about vertical angles is, imagine two lines crossing. So imagine two lines crossing, just like this. And they could literally be lines, and they're intersecting at a point. This is forming four angles, or you could imagine it's forming two sets of vertical angles. So if this is the angle that you care about, it's a vertical angle, it's the one on the opposite side of the intersection. It's one of these angles that it is not adjacent to. So it would be this angle right over here. So going back to the question, a vertical angle to angle EGA, well if you imagine the intersection of line EB and line DA, then the non-adjacent angle formed to angle EGA is angle DGB. Actually, what we already highlighted in magenta right over here. So this is angle DGB. Which could also be called angle BGD. These are obviously both referring to this angle up here. Name an angle that forms a linear pair with the angle DFG. So we'll put this in a new color. Angle DFG. Sorry, DGF, all of these should have G in the middle. DGF. So linear pair with angle DGF, so that's this angle right over here. So an angle that forms a linear pair will be an angle that is adjacent, where the two outer rays combined will form a line. So for example, if you combine angle DGF, which is this angle, and angle DGC, then their two outer rays form this entire line right over here. So we could say angle DGC. Or, if you look at angle DFG, you could form a line this way. If you take angle AGF, so if you take this one, then the outer rays will form this line. So angle AGF would also work. Angle AGF. Let's do one more. Name a vertical angle to angle FGB. So this is FGB right over here. You could imagine this angle is one of the four angles formed when CF-- let me highlight this, that's hard to see. This is the last one, so I can make a mess out of this. That angle is formed when CF and EB intersect with each other. And four angles are formed. The one question, FGB, these two angles that are adjacent to it, it shares a common ray. And then the vertical angle, the one that sits on the opposite side. So this angle, this angle right over here, which is angle EGC. Or you could also call it angle CGE. So angle CGE.",math_geometry-home_geometry-angles
" -  So I have the function g here. It's expressed as a fourth degree polynomial. And I wanna think about the intervals over which g is either concave upwards or concave downwards. Now let's just remind ourselves what these things look like. So concave, concave upwards is an interval, an interval when you're concave upwards is an interval over which the slope is increasing and it tends to look like an upward opening U like that. And you can see here that the slope over here is negative, and then as x increases, it becomes less negative, it actually approaches zero, it becomes zero, then it crosses zero and becomes slightly positive, more positive, even more positive. So you can see the slope is constantly increasing. And if you think about it in terms of derivatives, it means that you're first derivative is increasing over that interval. And in order for your first derivative to be increasing over that interval, your second derivative f prime prime of x, actually let me write it as g, because we're using g in this example. In order for your first derivative to be increasing, your, let me write this. So g, so concave upward means that your first derivative increasing, increasing, which means, which means that your second derivative is greater than zero. And concave downward is the opposite. Concave downward, downward, is an interval, or you're gonna be concave downward over an interval when your slope is decreasing. So g prime of x is decreasing or we can say that our second derivative, our second derivative is less than zero. And once again, I can draw it on this. So, when x is lower, we have a, look, or it looks like we have a positive slope, then it becomes less positive, and then it becomes less positive, as it's approaching zero, it becomes zero, then it becomes negative, then even more negative, and then even more negative. So as you can see, our slope is constantly decreasing as x increases here. So in order to think about the intervals where g is either concave upward or concave downward, what we need to do is let's find the second derivative of g, and then let's think about the points at which the second, where the second derivative can go from being positive to negative or negative to positive and those will be places where it's either undefined or where the second derivative is equal to zero, and let's see what's happening in the interval between. And then we'll know over what intervals are we concave upward or concave downward. So let's do that. So let's take the first derivative, g prime of x, just gonna apply the power rule a lot. Four times negative one is negative four x to the third power plus, okay, so you're gonna have two times six is plus 12x to the first power, you can just write it as x. And then minus two, I could say minus two x to the zeroth power, but that's just minus two. And then the derivative of negative three, of a constant is just zero. And now I can take the second derivative, g prime prime of x is going to be equal to three times negative four is negative 12x squared, decrement the exponent plus 12. And so let's see, where could this be undefined? Well, the second derivative is just a quadratic expression here which would be defined for any x. So it's not going to be undefined anywhere. So, interesting points where we could transition from going from a negative to a positive or a positive to a negative, second derivative is where this thing could be equal to zero. So let's figure that out. So let's figure out where negative 12x plus 12 could be equal to zero. See, we could subtract 12 from both sides and we get negative 12x squared is equal to negative 12. Divide both sides by negative 12, you get x squared is equal to one or x could be equal to the plus or minus, or x could be equal to the plus or minus square root of one, which is, of course, just one. So, at the second derivative at plus or minus one is equal to zero, so either between plus or minus one or on either side of them, we are going to be, we could be concave upward or concave downward. So let's think about this. And to think about this, I'm gonna make a number line. Let me find a nice, soothing color here. All right, that's a nice, soothing color. And, let's say, we should make the number line a little bit bigger. So, there we go, let's utilize the screen space. And so, if this is zero and this is negative one, this is negative two, this is positive one, this is positive two. We know that at x equals negative one and x equals one, our second derivative is equal to zero. So let's think about what's happening in between those places to see if our second derivative is positive or negative, and from that we'll be able to say where it's concave upward or concave downward. So, on this first interval right over here, so this is the interval from, this is the interval where we're going from negative infinity to negative one. Well, let's just try a value in that interval to see what whether our second derivative is positive or negative. And let's see, an easy value there could be negative two, it's in that interval, so let's take g prime prime of negative two, which is equal to negative 12 times four, because negative two squared is positive four. So it's negative 48 plus 12, so it's equal to negative 36. The important thing to realize, then, is well, if over here it's negative, then over this whole interval, because it's not crossing through zero, or it's not discontinuous at any of these points, that's why we picked this interval. That over this whole interval, g prime prime of x is less than zero, which means that over this interval we are concave downwards. So concave, concave downward, concave downward. Now let's go to the interval between negative one and one. So this is the open interval between negative one and one. And let's try a value there. Let's just try zero will be easy to compute, g prime prime of zero, well, when x is zero, this is zero, so it's just gonna be equal to 12. The important thing to realize is our second derivative here is greater than zero, so we are concave upward, concave upward on this interval between negative one and one. And then finally, let's look at, let's look at the interval where x is greater than one. So this is the interval from one to infinity, if we want to do it that way. And let's just try a value. Let's try g prime prime of two, 'cause that's in the interval. And g prime prime of two is gonna be the same thing as g prime prime of negative two, 'cause whether you have a negative two or a positive two, you square it becomes four. So you're gonna have four times negative 12, which is negative 48 plus 12, which is negative 36. So this is negative 36, and so, once again on this interval you are concave, concave downward. Now let's, I graphed this ahead of time, let's see if what we just established is actually consistent with what the graph actually looks like. We were able to come up with these, these insights about the concavity without graphing it. But now, it's kind of satisfying to take a look at a graph and actually let me see if I can match up the intervals. Actually this is pretty closely matched, all right over here. And so, this is, actually we can make it a little bit smaller, all right. And so, let me move my boundy box. So, I'm saying that I'm concave downward between negative infinity, negative infinity all the way until, all the way until negative one, all the way until this point right over here. So, all the way until that point. And that looks right. It looks like the slope is constantly decreasing all the way until we get to x equals negative one, and then the slope starts increasing. The slope starts increasing from there, from there all the way, and right at x we're transitioning, so I'm gonna leave a little, I won't color in that. And so here our slope is increasing, let me do that same color. Our slope is increasing, increasing, increasing, increasing, increasing all the way until we get to x equals one. And then our slope starts decreasing again. And we get back into concave downwards. Oops, I wanna do that in that orange color. We get back into concave downwards. So what we're able to figure out by just taking the derivatives and doing a little algebra, we can see quite clearly looking at the graph.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-derivatives-analyze-functions
" - Let's talk about one of the major female sex hormones, Estrogen. And before we officially start, I should mention that even though I said estrogen is one of the major female sex hormones, I just want to be clear here that males also produce and need a bit of estrogen as well, but we just produce sort of a small fraction of what female's need and produce. So let's take a look. Estrogen is produced in females primarily by the ovaries, and as sort of a bonus, when she's pregt, her placenta also produces some estrogen as well. There's also a little bit made by the adrenal glands that sit on top of the kidneys, the breasts, and by fat cells in general, but we'll sort of keep our focus on the ovaries as the primary source for now. So, the Anterior Pituitary hormone called follicle stimulating hormone, or FSH, causes follicles in the ovaries to develop, and when follicles in the ovaries develop, two groups of cells within them called Theca cells and Granulosa cells start to sort of team up and release estrogen into the bloodstream, and the amount sort of goes up and down throughout each month and that's because of signals from the Hypothalamus and the Anterior Pituitary. So, now we know where we get most of the estrogen in the body, and we know that its levels are regulated by interactions between the brain and the ovaries, but before we talk about what it does from a biological standpoint, I want to go over how estrogen actually works. So after estrogen is made in the ovaries by these Granulosa cells, it's transported to other places in the body by the bloodstream. And so I'll just draw little red blood cells here, and then I'll draw estrogen in light purple here. And these blood vessels take the estrogen all over the body so it can carry out all of its biological functions, but once it gets to its target, what exactly happens? How exactly does it work? So to show you this, I'll blow up a cell here in the thigh, and let's say that this here is the cell membrane, and this purply-blue thing here is the blood vessel that's sort of lining or running beside that cell. So we'll draw in our red blood cells and our estrogen. So when estrogen sees a cell that it wants to enter, it crosses the cell membrane, where it's picked up by a carrier protein, and I'll draw that as a taxi because all it's really doing it picking up estrogen and transporting it to its next destination in the cell, which is the nucleus, and the nucleus is where our DNA is. And so estrogen works by binding near to certain genes to change their expression, and so that'll ultimately change the behavior of that target cell. So that's how it works, but what exactly does it do in the body? What sort of effect does it have on a person's body? And I purposely say a person's body here to remind you that males and females sort of depend on estrogen to do different things in our respective bodies. So, for example, in males specifically, estrogen has a role in the maturation of sperm, and is stored to sorta pair up with testosterone to increase libido, also known as the sex drive. But estrogen does a lot of female-specific stuff. It actually has a lot to do with the growth and the development of the female reproductive tract. So for one, we know that it stimulates the growth of the ovaries and the follicles inside the ovaries as part of the reproductive cycle. It also causes growth of the smooth muscle components of the female reproductive tract. For example, the smooth muscle in the uterus and the uterine tubes after puberty. It also stimulates the growth of the female's external genitalia and breasts during puberty as well, and the way it sort of manages breast growth is by primarily increasing the fat that gets deposited in the breasts. And speaking of fat deposition, estrogen's also responsible for the so-called female fat distribution pattern, which is deposition on the hips as well as the breasts, in contrast to the male pattern, which is fat distribution around the tummy. So those are the major effects that estrogen has on the reproductive tract and on that fat distribution role. There are some other really important non-reproductive roles that estrogen has as well, and we'll touch on two of those. So number one, estrogen does some really good things for your blood cholesterol levels, and for you to really appreciate this point, I kind of have to tell you a bit about cholesterol first. So, bear with me for a minute, and let's have a quick chat about cholesterol. So cholesterol is a lipid molecule that, despite all the negative press it receives, it's kind of essential for life. It's required to make nice, healthy cell membranes, and, maybe a bit ironically, we make a lot of our hormones out of cholesterol, and in fact our testosterone and estrogen themselves are made from cholesterol. Our cholesterol has to be carried around our bodies in the bloodstream, and essentially, we have a couple types of molecules that carry the cholesterol around. So we have one molecule called HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, and we have another molecule called LDL, or low-density lipoprotein. And all that density business in their names just refers to the ratio of protein to cholesterol that these molecules have in them. So, for example, HDL has lots of protein and a little bit of cholesterol. So it's high-density in terms of its protein content, but for simplicity sake, we'll just call them good cholesterol, being the HDL, and bad cholesterol, being the LDL, and the reason they're differentiated as being ""good and bad"" is because high levels of the bad kind, LDL, is implicated in causing problems with your blood vessels, which can lead to things like heart attacks or strokes, and optimum levels of the good kind, HDL, is correlated with reduced risk of having these bad things happen. So, back to estrogen. Estrogen actually reduces the bad cholesterol, LDL, and increases the good cholesterol, HDL. So that's pretty great. Kind of a lot of cholesterol background to make that point, but it's physiologically a really important role of estrogen and, in fact, after a female slows her production of estrogen in her fifties, her level of HDL can actually start to go down. So that's estrogen and cholesterol. Another really important estrogen role is one that has to do with preserving the strength of our bones in our skeletal system. So, throughout our lives, bones are constantly undergoing renovations, and that sounds a bit weird, right, because we always tend to think of bones as being these static unchanging things, but actually on a microscopic level, they're constantly being broken down and built back up, and estrogen actually affects part of that process. So estrogen slows down the cells that are involved with the breakdown portion of your bone renovations. So as a result of that, your skeleton stays more dense for a longer period of time, and that means that as estrogen levels get lower when a female gets older, she's more at risk for developing a bone condition where the bones get brittle and weak, and that's called osteoporosis. So that's a little overview of the importance of estrogen and a few of its biological roles within the body.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" We have the absolute value of 2r minus 3 and 1/4 is less than 2 and 1/2, and we want to solve for r. So right from the get go we have to deal with this absolute value. And just as a bit of a review, if I were to say that the absolute value of x is less than, well let's just say, less than 2 and 1/2, that means that the distance from x to 0 is less than 2 and 1/2. That means that x would have to be less than 2 and 1/2, and x would have to be greater than negative 2 and 1/2. And just think about it for a second. If I were to draw it on a number line right here, that is 0, that is 2 and 1/2, and that is negative 2 and 1/2. These two numbers are exactly 2 and 1/2 away from 0, because both of their absolute values is 2 and 1/2. Now, if we want all of the numbers whose absolute value is less than 2 and 1/2, or that are less than 2 and 1/2 away from 0, it would be all of the numbers in between. And that's exactly what these two statements are saying. x has to be less than 2 and 1/2, and it has to be greater than negative 2 and 1/2. If this absolute value were the other way, that the absolute value of x has to be greater than 2 and 1/2, then it would be the numbers outside of this, and it would be an or. But we're dealing with the less than situation right there, so let's just do what we were able to figure out when it was just an x. The distance from this thing to 0 has to be less than 2 and 1/2, so we can write that 2r minus 3 and 1/4 has to be less than 2 and 1/2 and 2r minus 3 and 1/4 has to be greater than negative 2 and 1/2. Same exact reasoning here. Let me draw a line so we don't get confused. Same exact reasoning here. This quantity right here has to be between negative 2 and 1/2. It has to be greater than negative 2 and 1/2 right there. And it has to be less than 2 and 1/2, so that's all I wrote there. So let's solve each of these independently. Well, this first went over here, you've learned before that I don't like improper fractions, and I don't like fractions in general. So let's make all of these fractions. Sorry, I don't like mixed numbers. I want them to be improper fractions. So let's turn all of these into improper fractions. So if I were to rewrite it, we get 2r minus 3 and 1/4 is the same thing as 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. 2r minus 13/4 is less than-- 2 times 2 is 4, plus 1 is five-- is less than 5/2. So that's the first equation. And then the second question-- and do the same thing here-- we have 2r minus 13 over 4 has to be a greater than negative 5/2. All right, now let's solve each of these independently. To get rid of the fractions, the easiest thing to do is to multiply both sides of this equation by 4. That'll eliminate all of the fractions, so let's do that. Let's multiply-- let me scroll to the left a little bit-- let's multiply both sides of this equation by 4. And what do we get? 4 times 2r is 8r, 4 times negative 13 over 4 is negative 13, is less than-- and I multiplied by a positive number so I didn't have to worry about swapping the inequality-- is less than 5/2 times 4 is 10, right? You get a 2 and a 1, it's 10. So you get 8r minus 13 is less than 10. Now we can add 13 to both sides of this equation so that we get rid of it on the left-hand side. Add 13 to both sides and we get 8r-- these guys cancel out-- is less than 23, and then we divide both sides by 8. And once again, we didn't have to worry about the inequality because we're dividing by a positive number. And we get r is less than 23 over 8. Or, if you want to write that as a mixed number, r is less than-- what is that-- 2 and 7/8. So that's one condition, but we still have to worry about this other condition. There was an and right here. Let's worry about it. So our other condition tells us 2r minus 13 over 4 has to be greater than negative 5/2. Let's multiply both sides of this equation by 4. So 4 times 2r is 8r. 4 times negative 13 over 4 is negative 13, is greater than negative 5/2 times 4 is negative 10. Now we add 13 to both sides of this equation. The left-hand side-- these guys cancel out, you're just left with 8r-- is greater than negative 10 plus 13 is 3. Or divide both sides of this by 8, and you're left with r has to be greater than 3/8. So our two conditions, r has to be less than 2 and 7/8 and greater than 3/8. Or we can just write it like this: r is greater than 3/8, so it's greater than-- maybe I should say 3/8 is less than r, which is less than 2 and 7/8. So if we were to plot the solution on the number line-- which I'm about to do, so that's my number line-- this is 0 right here, maybe this is 1, 2, and 3. We have 2 and 7/8. We have to be less than 2 and 7/8. Let's say that this is 2 and 7/8 right there. And we have to be greater than 3/8. Say that is 3/8, so 3/8 will be some place right around there. And everything in between is a valid solution. And we could try it out. Let's try out something that, based on what I just drew, should be a valid solution. 1 should be a valid solution. Let's try it out here. 2 times 1 minus 3 and 1/4, what is that? That's 2 minus 3 and 1/4. And so what is that? 2 minus 3 and 1/4 is-- well, 3 and 1/4 minus 2 is 1 and 1/4, so this will be negative 1 and 1/4. But we're taking the absolute value of it, so we take the absolute value of it, which is equal to 1 and 1/4, which is indeed less than 2 and 1/2. Now let's try another number. Let's try 0. Based on this, 0 should not work. So what happens if we put 0 here? You get 2 times 0, which is 0, minus 3 and 1/4. If you take the absolute value of negative 3 and 1/4, you'll get positive 3 and 1/4, which won't work. 3 and 1/4 is greater than 2 and 1/2, so that's true, that works out. And same thing for 3. 2 times 3 is 6, minus 3 and 1/4 is 2 and 3/4. Take the absolute value, it's 2 and 3/4, still bigger than 2 and 1/2, so it won't work. So at least the points that we tried out seem to validate this solution that we got.",math_algebra-home_alg-absolute-value
" The Nile River has overflowed and covered its entire surroundings, except for the tip of the Great Pyramid in Giza, Egypt. An expedition was sent to find how high the water had risen. The people measured the edge of the pyramid that's above the water and found it was 72 meters long. So this distance right over here is 72 meters. They knew that the entire length of the edge is 180 meters, when it's not flooded. So this entire length is 180 meters. They also knew that the vertical height of the pyramid is 139 meters. So this is 139 meters. What is the level of the water above the ground? So the ground is right over here at the base of the pyramid. And so they want the level of the water above the ground. So that's this height, this height right over here. So let's just call that h. We want to figure out what h is. Round your answer, if necessary, to two decimal places. So what do we know, and what do we not know? So they've labeled this little angle here theta. And this, of course, is a right angle. So this angle here at the base of the pyramid, this is going to be the complement of theta. It's going to be 90 degrees minus theta. And using that information, we can also figure out that this angle up here is also going to be theta. If that looks a little bit strange to you, let me just draw it out here and make it a little bit clearer. If we have a triangle, a right triangle, where this angle right over here is 90 minus theta, and we wanted to figure out what this is up here, let's say this is x. Well, we could say x plus 90 minus theta, 90 degrees minus theta, plus 90 degrees is going to be equal to-- well, the sum of the angles of a triangle are going to be 180 degrees. Well, if we subtract 180 from both sides, so that's 100, and that's 100. That's 180 from the left, 180 from the right. We get x minus theta is equal to 0. Or if you add theta to both sides, x is equal to theta. So this thing up here is going to be theta as well. So this is also going to be theta. And what else do we know? Well, we know this is 72. We know that the whole thing is 180. So this is 72, and the whole thing is 180. The part of this edge that's below the water, this distance right over here. Let me draw it without cluttering the picture too much. I'll do it in that black color. This distance right over here is going to be 108. 108 plus 72 is 180. So what does this do for us? We need to figure out this height. We know that this right over here is a right triangle. I could color this in just to make it a little bit clearer. This thing in yellow, right over here is a right triangle. If we look at that right triangle, and if we wanted to solve for h and solve for h using a trig ratio based on this angle theta right over here, we know that relative to this angle theta, this side of length h is an adjacent side. And this length of 108 right over here along the edge, that's the hypotenuse of this yellow triangle that I just highlighted in. So which trig ratio involves an adjacent side and a hypotenuse? Well, we just write SOHCAHTOA. Sine is opposite over hypotenuse. That would be this distance over the hypotenuse. Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. So we get the cosine of theta is going to be equal to the height that we care about. That's the adjacent side of this right triangle over the length of the hypotenuse, OVER 108. Well, that doesn't help us yet because we don't know what the cosine of theta is. But there's a clue here. Theta is also sitting up here. So maybe if we can figure out what cosine of theta is based up here, then we can solve for h. So if we look at this data, what is the cosine of theta? And now we're looking at a different right triangle. We're looking at this entire right triangle now. Based on that entire right triangle, what is cosine of theta? Well, cosine of theta, once again, is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse. The adjacent length is this length right over here. We already know that's 139 meters. So it's going to be equal to 139 meters. And what's the length of the hypotenuse? Well, the hypotenuse is this length right over here. It's 72 plus 108. Oh, we already have it labeled here. It's 180. We can assume that this is an isosceles-- that this pyramid is an isosceles triangle. So 180 on that side and 180 on that side. So the cosine is adjacent-- 139-- over the hypotenuse, which is 180, over 180. And these data are the same data. We just showed that. So now we have cosine of theta is h/108. Cosine of theta is 139/180. Or we could say that h/108, which is cosine of theta, also is equal to 139/180. Both of these things are equal to cosine of theta. Now to solve for h, we just multiply both sides by 108. So h is equal to 139 times 108/180. So let's get our calculator out and calculate that. So that is going to be 139 times 108, divided by 180, gets us to 83.4 meters. So h is equal to 83.4 meters. The height of the water is 83.4.",math_geometry_hs-geo-trig
" -  Alright so there's some terminology you gotta get used to when dealing with simple harmonic oscillators because people and books and teachers and professors are gonna throw these terms around like crazy, and if you are not used to them, it all can sound like mathematical witchcraft. So the first term you gotta know is that if you displace a mass from equilibrium, and why wouldn't you do that. That's how you get the thing to oscillate, by displacing it from equilibrium. The maximum magnitude of displacement, so this amount right here, whatever that distance is here, is called the amplitude. So we represent the amplitude with a capital A, and it's called the amplitude, and it's defined to be the maximum magnitude of displacement for that oscillator. So if this mass only ever makes it this far away, so from here to here. And I'm drawing arrows, but this is not a vector. It's the magnitude. Right? Magnitude of the displacement. So it's the magnitude of the vector, so it's always positive. So we can draw that over here. If we want to, we can just say this amplitude here. This would also be the amplitude, because we're just talking about the maximum magnitude of displacement. So it's gonna get displaced equally on either side of the equilibrium position and that maximum amount is called the amplitude. So in other words, if I pulled this mass back 20 centimeters then that means 20 centimeters would be the amplitude, or if you wanted it in meters it would be point two meters, and then, that means, when it shoots through the equilibrium position, it would also come over here and compress this spring by 20 centimeters on this side. So it's always equal on both sides. Now there's another term that you gotta get used to, and that's the period. So the period is represented with a capital T. Why is the period represented with a capital T when there's no T in the word Period? Not sure. But capital T is kind of like time, so T might stand for time. Maybe they thought that was a good idea. Because what the period means, is the time required for an entire cycle. So what does this mean. An entire cycle? What we mean is that you got oscillations going on. So this process is repeating itself. So in other words: if you start with the mass over here, it's gonna eventually make it over to this end over here, right? Goes over here, compresses the spring, then it's gonna come back. The time it takes, oh, that's a little hard to see, sorry. Let me draw that up here. So the time it takes for it to go to here, and then come all the way back after this happened, the whole thing just repeats. Now it's back here, the spring is gonna pull it back to the left, and go to the right. It's gonna pull it back to the left, push it back to the right. So this process is repeating itself. There's not something new happening. It's just the same process over and over. The time it takes to go through one entire cycle; ie: The time it takes to reset, essentially, once this entire system resets to the same position, that's the period. And so it's gonna be the same. Wether I count this as from this point back to that point, or if I imagine just starting my clock here, from this point is gonna go over to here, then it's gonna come back here, that would also be the period, because it's the time it took to reset. So the time it takes for this process to reset is what we call the period. It will be given in seconds, so for the sake to making this a little less abstract, let's say for example, the period of this mass on the spring was six seconds. What would that mean? It would mean that it took six seconds for the mass to go from this point and then all the way back to that point resetting itself. Now, this is getting kind of messy. And honestly, for that reason people often draw what the simple harmonic oscillator looks like on a graph. It turns out to be particularly elegant and useful to represent these ideas on a graph. Because, look it. If you just drew what's happening, you'd be like: alright, the mass goes here, and then there, and then there and then there, you are drawing all over yourself. So that's kinda ugly looking. It's better to represent this on a graph. What would that look like? So let me get rid of this. It would look like this. You would have a graph of the horizontal position X. So what does that mean? That means this. So we are essentially graphing what this is. This is X. The horizontal position has a function of time. Now already you might be upset. You might be like: Wait a minute. Why did we stick the horizontal position on the vertical axis? Isn't that a dumb thing to do? Well, perhaps. But long ago physicists decided: You know what? Time, if time is involved, we are sticking that bad boy on the horizontal axis. This is just designated. This is just by default. It's gonna go on the horizontal axis. So if you have anything else you wanna graph with it, that's gotta go on the vertical axis. And so unfortunately we're gonna be graphing horizontal position on this vertical axis. What that means is that this equilibrium position, remember this is the point where the net force, the restoring force, that net restoring force is zero. The only force on this mass, in this case, is the spring force which is given by Hook's law and that means this equilibrium position is gonna be the point where X equals zero. If I want my force to be zero, I better have x equals zero. So this equilibrium position right here, this is the line right here, let me give it a special color, this equilibrium position, is essentially just this X equals zero line. Right? These two lines are representing the same thing. They represent X equals zero. And if I go this way, if I pull this mass to the right, I'm essentially going up on this graph. Because I am going towards positive horizontal positions. And if I go to the left, if I push this mass to the left, I'm essentially going down towards negative horizontal positions on this graph. So hopefully that doesn't freak you out too bad. Let me show you what this looks like. If we do displace this mass, Let's say we pull it to the right. So like we had over here, right? We have this mass, we pull it to the right, and if we started 20 centimeters from the equilibrium position and let go. What's that gonna look like on this graph? Well it started to the right. If it starts to the right, I'm gonna start way over here, at this point is my initial position. That means I'm gonna start up here. I'll start up here at X equals 20 centimeters. If we put that in meters, technically SI units, you should have meters for the default units, so this would be point two. Zero point two meters, and that's also the amplitude. So remember, this is the amplitude. So this distance here is the amplitude. Then what does the mass do? Well it shoots back toward equilibrium, that's X equals zero. And then it oscillates. It goes through that point and comes back, so essentially what you're gonna have on here goes toward equilibrium, so it looks like this, goes toward equilibrium, BOOM! Hits equilibrium. And that's when it's at X equals zero. Passing through this point right here. Then it's gonna come back down, so eventually is gonna compress the spring and stop. That's when you're way over here and you've then stopped. The mass has been stopped by this spring. And it's gonna come back up and this process is gonna repeat, it's gonna go back through the equilibrium position and come back up. Which by up it means over here back to this initial point. That's one whole cycle. Look it, that has gone through a whole cycle. I kinda made this a little too high. Let me make that a little better. It should never go any higher that it started here. So it's gonna look something like that. Come back down and this whole process repeats over and over and over. And If I was drawing this perfectly, it'd be perfectly smooth, but hopefully you get the idea. And this is great! 'cause now we can draw the variables we talked about earlier like amplitude, because amplitude is the maximum magnitude of displacement from equilibrium. That would equal point two meters. That's what we represented on this graph here. And we can also represent the period. Remember, the period was the time it takes to go through an entire cycle. So if our mass started here, to go through an entire cycle, it better get back to that point and have reset completely, so that would be to here. So on this graph, this is the period. So the time it took to do that is one whole period. That would be the period T, which if we recall what we said earlier, we said that the period was six seconds. So if it really is six seconds, we can say that this here would be, if we count this is time T equals zero, this would be six seconds, this would be three seconds, that would be half of the period, or half of the cycle. This would be nine seconds, this would be 12 seconds, which would be two whole periods. And in a sense, it has gone through two whole cycles once it gets back to that point. Now notice, you didn't have to measure the period from peak to peak. You could have measured it from, sometimes people call these troughs or valleys, so you can measure it trough to trough, or valley to valley, took three seconds to nine seconds. That's a time of six seconds. It took six seconds to go from three seconds to nine seconds. That's still one whole period. Or you can go from this point here, I guess this would be like seven point five seconds all the way to what is this, 13.5 seconds? That would also be one whole period. Just make sure you don't do this: Sometimes people are like: oh, a period, eh? Repeat a whole cycle, eh? Alright I'm gonna go from this equilibrium position back to that equilibrium position. That's not a whole cycle. Look at it. This point the mass is going that way, and this point the mass is going that way. So you can't start your clock when the mass is going that way. Stop it when the mass is going the other way and see if you have gone through a whole cycle. Because that hasn't fully reset. If you're gonna fully reset, you gotta go from mass heading to the left through equilibrium, all the way back to mass heading to the left through equilibrium. So you would have to go from this equilibrium point, all the way to that equilibrium point to have a full cycle. A cycle would look like this whole process right there. So recapping: the amplitude of a simple harmonic oscillator is the maximum magnitude of displacement from the equilibrium position. You can measure it that way or you can measure it this way, you would get the same amount. And the period is the time it takes for an oscillator to complete one entire cycle, which you can find on a graph by measuring the time it takes to go from peak to peak, from valley to valley, or from equilibrium position, skip an equilibrium position, and then get to the next equilibrium position.",science_physics_mechanical-waves-and-sound
" Let's see if we can get some experience converting from a decimal representation to a binary representation. Let's start with the fairly straightforward example with a fairly low number. Let's see if we can convert the number 13 in decimal to binary. And I encourage you to pause the video, and try to work through it out on your own. So I'm assuming you had a go at it. So the key here is to see if you can deconstruct the number 13 as the sum of powers of two. And then it becomes very straightforward to represent it in binary. Because in binary, you're essentially saying, well what powers of two do you need to make up this number. So let's just write the powers of two here, just to remind ourselves. And I'll go until we go right above 13. So two to the zero is equal to one, Two to the first is equal to 2. Two squared is equal to four. Two to the third is equal to eight. Two to the fourth is equal to 16. So now, I'm above 13, so I have all the powers of two that I need to construct 13. So what's the largest power of two, that is less than or equal to 13? Well, 16's too large, well it would be eight. So I could rewrite 13 as eight plus five. Now five is not a power of two, so I have to keep deconstructing that. What's the largest power of two, that is less than or equal to five? We see it right over here, it's four. So let me rewrite that, it's eight plus, instead of writing five, I'll write four plus one, and then the good thing is at one as a power of two we already see is the largest power of two that is less than or equal to it is one. This already is a power of two. So I now have rewritten this as the sum of powers of two. Notice this is two to the third power. This is two squared, and this is two to the zero power. Or I could write it like this. I have 1 eight, clearly. I have 1 four, and I have 1 one. So I can add these two, I can add these three together. 13 could be considered 1 eight plus 1 four plus 1 one. Why is that helpful? Well now, let's go in to binary mode. And think about what each of the place values represent. So, this is the ones place, that's the ones place. And then we can go to the twos place. Every time we go to the left, each place we multiply by two. It's the next power of two. Then we go to the fours place, fours place. And then we go the eights place, eights. In binary I only have two digits, zero and one. So I either have zero of a place or I have one of it. So let's go through it. How many ones do I have? Well I have 1 one, so I write that there. How many twos do I have? Well in this representation I don't have any twos. I have an eight, I have a four and a one. So I'm gonna put I have 0 twos. How many fours do I have? Well I have 1 four. And how many eights do I have? Well I have 1 eight. So 13, or 13 which is a decimal number. If I were to write it in binary, is one one zero one.",math_algebra-home_alg-intro-to-algebra
" In this video, I want to talk about how neuron graded potentials are created and why they decay with both time and distance. So I have again drawn a neuron with the soma in red, and I've blown up an axon in green, and I've blown up two large dendrites in blue. And here's our graph looking at the membrane potential on the y-axis. And I've put in a few values in millivolts-- negative 50, negative 60, and negative 70. And we'll have time on the x-axis. So now recall that a resting neuron without inputs has a layer of positively charged ions on the outside of the membrane and a layer of negatively charged ions on the inside of the membrane. And that the strength of that charge separation without inputs may vary between neurons, but it's often around negative 60 millivolts for the resting potential. And recall that neurons have a threshold potential that's often around negative 50 millivolts so that if the membrane potential at the trigger zone passes the threshold potential, an action potential may be fired down the axon. And recall that with inputs, the resting potential of neurons may be moved by small brief potential changes that we call graded potentials that may move the membrane potential closer to 0, which we call a depolorization, or an excitatory potential, or which may move the membrane potential away from 0 and farther away from threshold, which we call a hyperpolarization, or an inhibitory potential. Now, to understand how these graded potentials occur, I need to introduce a new type of ion channel, which I've drawn here. And these are neurotransmitter receptors. Neurotransmitter receptors are found at synapses where the axon terminal of another neuron where neurotransmitters or molecules are released into the synapse, and they bind to these neurotransmitters receptors. Many neurotransmitter receptors are a type of ligand gated ion channel, which means that unlike the leak channels that we talked about before, which are always open, these channels are gated. They're closed most of the time until their ligand, which in this case is a neurotransmitter, binds to the receptor. And then the ion channel opens and ions may pass across the membrane through the channel. The graded potentials that are produced depends on which types of ions are allowed to pass. Because some of these allow only one type of ion to pass, while others allow multiple types of ions to pass. It also depends on how many channels are opened, which depends on the amount of neurotransmitter released into the synapse, and it depends on how long the channels stay open, which depends on how long neurotransmitter stays in the synapse to continue binding to the neurotransmitter receptor. If a channel opens that is selective for only one type of ion, the membrane permeability for that ion is increased, which causes the potential of the membrane around the channel to move toward the equilibrium potential of that ion. And recall that an equilibrium potential is the membrane potential at which a certain ion will have balanced electrical and diffusion forces, so that even if there are open channels, there is no net movement of that ion. If the channel is a sodium channel or a calcium channel, opening of that channel will usually cause a depolarization, an excitatory potential, because these cations will usually flow into the neuron bringing positive charges into the negative inside of the neuron, causing a depolarization. Because for sodium and calcium, both their electrical force and their diffusion force are trying to drive them into the neuron if there are open channels through which they can pass. Hyperpolarization usually occurs if a chloride channel is opened. Because for most neurons, chloride will flow into the neuron through an open channel bringing negative charges into the already negative inside of the cell, causing the membrane potential to become more negative. And that's because for most neurons, chloride has a larger diffusion force driving it into the neuron against its smaller electrical force that's trying to drive it out of the neuron. Hyperpolarization may also occur if a potassium channel opens, because for potassium ions, it's larger diffusion force will usually drive it out of a neuron against its smaller electrical force trying to drive it into the neuron. Let's look at one of these channels a little bit more closely and see what's happening to the ions when neurotransmitter binds to the receptor and the channel opens to the ion. Let's first consider a sodium channel. So let's say this neurotransmitter ion channel when neurotransmitter binds, it opens and it only allows sodium ions to flow into the neuron. Now, as these sodium ions are flowing through this open channel, there will be an increase concentration of sodium in a small area right around the channel. And as these positive charges are building up on the inside of the membrane around the channel, that's depolarizing this part of the membrane. So let me actually write that. So this piece of the membrane, then, what we're going to see is that the membrane potential starts to move to a less negative value. But then the question is why does this stop. Why doesn't the membrane potential just keep climbing from here? Well, the first thing that happens is that the neurotransmitter will leave the receptor. It will become unbound to the receptor. And without neurotransmitter bound, the ion channel will close. So it's no longer allowing positively charged sodium ions to flow into the neuron. So that's going to cause the graded potential to kind of plateau. It's going to stop growing at that point. But then why does it decay? Why do these graded potentials only last a short time and decay with time? Well, the reason for this is that this little area right here where there's a high concentration of sodium ions isn't going to stay like that. Because all of these sodium ions are acted on by electrical and diffusion forces inside the cytoplasm, just like they are when we're talking about them across the membrane. The diffusion force is going to want them to go from areas of high concentration to areas of lower concentration. And the electrical force is also going to want that. These positively charged ions are going to want to get as far away from each other as they can, because like charges repel each other. So these sodium ions that came in through the open channel are going to go racing off in every direction to get as far away from each other as they can. And they'll just mix in with all the other ions through the cytoplasm until they are as far away from each other as they can, and then they're in equilibrium. And the cytoplasm has an enormous total number of sodium ions compared to the very small number that came through this open channel during the brief time that it was open. So because this small area of increased concentration of sodium ions isn't going to last, all these sodium ions are going to race away from each other. The depolarization of this piece of the membrane is not going to last either. And this is going to be the decay that happens with time. That piece of membrane is just going to go right back to the resting potential once all these sodium ions spread out and equilibrate through the rest of the cytoplasm. Imagine this as a small hemisphere of increased sodium concentration on the inside of the membrane centered on the open channel. This hemisphere rapidly expands in all directions away from the channel on the inside of the membrane, weakening as it expands. And as these sodium ions are getting further away from each other, until eventually fades away entirely as the sodium equilibrates with the sodium and the rest of the cytoplasm. As this little hemisphere of increased sodium ion concentration expands away from the channel, weakening as it expands, a wave of depolarization starts spreading across the membrane away from the open channel. And that wave of depolarization is also weakening as it spreads, so that right here, it might be a certain size. If we look at this piece of membrane, maybe it's about that size. But as its kind of spreading across the membrane, if we check in with it a little farther away, It has weakened. It has decayed. And as it continues spreading along the membrane and these sodium ions are spreading farther and farther apart, the depolarization gets smaller and smaller so that the graded potential degrades with distance just like it degrades the time. So this is the way that graded potentials degrade with time and degrade with distance, so that their effects are only additive if they occur close enough together in time and in space. The most common cause of an excitatory graded potential in neurons is entry of sodium ions through neurotransmitter receptors that allow sodium ions to pass when the neurotransmitter is bound. But the mechanism would be the same for calcium ions. They also would flow into the neuron bringing their positive charges in, which would then rapidly spread out in every direction, causing an excitatory potential. The most common cause of inhibitory potentials in neurons is entry of chloride ions through neurotransmitters receptors that allow chloride ions to pass. And the mechanism is really the same. But because chloride is an anion, we're going to have a little build up of negative charges affecting the membrane potential around the channel, making it more negative. And then the diffusion forces and the electrical forces will cause the chloride ions to spread out to try to equilibrate in the rest of the cytoplasm, so that a hyperpolarization caused by chloride ion entry through a neurotransmitter receptor will also decay with time and with distance. Inhibitory potentials may also occur if a neurotransmitter receptor allows potassium ions to exit the neuron. The mechanism of this is really the same as well, but now we have a collection of positive charges around the open channel on the outside of the membrane. So that makes the positive outside even more positive, which is the same thing as saying that the inside of the membrane is more negative. So you get a hyperpolarization. And then this little area of increased potassium ion 1concentration will rapidly dissipate out. 1But in this case, it's dissipating 1into the interstitial fluid outside of the neuron as 1opposed to the cytoplasm inside the neuron.",science_health-and-medicine_nervous-system-and-sensory-infor
" Add, and they give us 5x squared plus 8x minus 3 plus 2x squared minus 7x plus 13x. So we can really view this as just adding two polynomials. And actually, the second polynomial here can be simplified right off the bat. We have two like terms here. It's not the 2x squared. There's no other 2x squared term in this polynomial. But you have a negative 7x term. And then you have a plus 13x. So we could actually add these two terms. What is the negative 7 of something plus 13 of that something? Or another way to view it, what's 13x minus 7x? 13 of something minus 7 of that something? Well, that's just going to be 6 of that something. So that is just going to be 6x. And then you have your 2x squared. And you have your 2x squared right over here. Let me write it. So 2x squared. So this polynomial right over here simplifies to 2x squared plus 6x. And then we want to add it to this polynomial right over here. And what we can do is, what I like to do is just rewrite this polynomial under this polynomial. And I'm going to align the similar terms or the like terms, the terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. So we have x raised to the second power. So let's put the 5x squared over here. We have an x raised to the first power. We have an x raised to the first power. So let's put the 8x over here. And then we don't have a constant term in this yellow polynomial. We don't have anything raised to the zeroth power, any constant terms. We do here. So let's just put a minus 3. And then we could add these two things up. We have 2x squared plus 5x squared. That is 2 of something plus 5 of something is 7 of that something. So it's going to be 7x squared. And then to that, if I 6 of something and I add 8 of that something to it, well, I'm going to have 14 of that something. If I have 6x's and I give you 8 more x's, you're going to 14x's. And then we have nothing here. And so if we just add nothing to negative 3, you're just going to get a negative 3. So this simplifies to, or when we added these two polynomials, we get 7x squared plus 14x minus 3.",math_algebra-home_alg-polynomials
" This is just a quick review of what we were doing in the last video. We had this oddly shaped pipe and the fluid coming in had input velocity V1. The pressure on the left-hand side pushing to the right is P1, and the area of this hole is A1. Everything that the same variables with the 2 on it is coming out of the pipe. What we just set up in that last video is we said by the law of conservation of energy, essentially the joules, the energy at this point in the system, or that we're putting into the system, has to be equal to the energy coming out of the system. We used that information to set up this big equation, but it's not too complicated. We figured out that the work going into the system was the input pressure times the mass of volume over some period of time divided by the density of whatever type of liquid we had, which was the potential energy. This is just typically mgh, where the mass is the mass of this column of fluid. We're saying, how much work was done over some period of time T? That's the way I would think about it. How much energy was there over some period of time T? The kinetic energy over that period of time would have been the mass of this volume of fluid times its velocity squared divided by 2. That's typical kinetic energy. Of course, that has to be equal to essentially the output energy, and so this is the output work, or how much work a column of water could do on the output side. It's an equivalent volume of water, remember that. In some period of time T, whatever volume of water this was, an equivalent volume of water-- maybe it'll be a longer cylinder now, because it's going to be going faster. So on the output side, it's this longer cylinder that we're talking about, but it's going to be the same volume and the same mass. So what we say is that the work that this column can do in that same amount of time would be the output pressure times the mass of this column divided by the density of the column-- which is the same because the density of the liquid is the same throughout-- times the mass of this column, which is the same as the mass of this column because the volume and the density hasn't changed, so they're the same mass. Now, this column has more potential energy. It's up at h2, which I'm assuming is higher than h1. This kinetic energy is just the mass of this cylinder of fluid times its velocity squared, which is the output velocity divided by 2. This is potential energy out, and this is kinetic energy out. These equal each other. This setup is Bernoulli's equation, but let's see if we can clean it up so that we can get rid of variables that we don't have to know about. One thing that we see is that there's an m in every term, so let's get rid of them. Divide both sides of this equation by m. We get that. I don't like this density in the denominator here, so let's multiply both sides of this equation by density, and what we're left with is-- let me write this in a vibrant color. P, the input pressure, plus-- and we're multiplying everything by this rho, this density. So we have input pressure plus rho g h1, the input height, the initial height, plus rho v squared over 2. This is rho v squared over 2, and that equals-- we multiplied both sides by rho, so we get the input velocity, so that equals the pressure out plus the density times gravity times the output height. Let's make everything consistent. I wrote 2's here, so let's just say this is pressure 2, this is height 2, plus rho times the velocity squared. This is Bernoulli's equation, and it has all sorts of what I would say is fairly neat repercussions. For example, let's assume that the height stays constant, so we can ignore these middle terms. If the height is constant, if I have a higher velocity and this whole term is constant, then my pressure is going to be lower. Think about it: If height is constant, this doesn't change, but if this velocity increases, but this whole thing is constant, pressure has to decrease. Similarly, if pressure increases, then velocity is going to decrease. That might be a little unintuitive, but the other way, it makes a lot of sense. When velocity increases, this pressure is going to decrease, and that's actually what makes planes fly and all sorts of neat things happen, but we'll get more into that in a second. Let's see if we can use Bernoulli's equation to do something useful. You should memorize this, and it shouldn't be too hard to memorize. It's pressure, and then you have this potential energy term, but instead of mass, you have density. You have this kinetic energy term. It's not kinetic energy anymore, because we manipulated it some, but instead of mass, you have density. With that said, let's do a problem. I'll keep this down here, since you probably haven't memorized it as yet. Let me erase everything else. That's not how I wanted to erase it. That's how I wanted to erase it. I wanted to erase it like that without getting rid of anything useful. OK, that's good enough. And then let me clean up. Clean up all this stuff. Let's say that I have a cup. I'll just draw a cup. It's easier to draw sometimes then to draw straight lines and all of that. No, that's too dark. Do purple. I'm using a super-wide tool. I have to switch the length. OK, so that's my cup. It has some fluid. Actually, let's say it has a top to it, and I have some fluid in it. Maybe it happens to be red. We haven't been dealing with red fluids as yet,. Let me-- oh, I didn't want to do that. So you know there's a fluid there. And let's say that there's no air here, so this is a vacuum. Let's say that h-- we don't know what units are, but let's say h meters below the surface of the fluid. This is all fluid here. I poke a hole right there, and fluid starts spurting out. My question to you is, what is this output velocity of the fluid as a function of this height? Let me tell you something else. Let's say that this hole is so small, let's call the area of that hole A2, and let's say that the surface area of the water is A1. Let's say that hole is so small that the surface area the water-- let's say that A2 if equal to 1/1,000 of A1. This is a small hole relative to the surface area of this cup. With that said, let's see what we can do about figuring out the velocity coming out. Bernoulli's equation tells us that the input pressure plus the input potential energy plus the input kinetic energy is equal to the output, et cetera. So what is the input pressure? Well, the input pressure, the pressure at this point, there's no air or no fluid above it, so the pressure at that point is zero. What is the input height? Let's just assume that the hole is done at height 0, h equals 0, so the input height h1 is just h. If this is 0, then this height right here is h. What is the input velocity? We know from the continuity equation, or whatever that thing was called, that the input velocity times the input area is equal to the output velocity times the output area. We also know that the output area is equal to 1/1,000 of the input area-- and this is area 2-- so we know that the input velocity times area 1 is equal to the output velocity times 1/1,000 of area 1. We could say area 1 over 1,000 and divide both sides by area 1. We know that the input velocity is equal to V2 over 1,000, so that's good to know. These are the three inputs into the left-hand side of Bernoulli's equation. What's on the right-hand side of Bernoulli's equation? What's P2? 1What's the pressure at this point? 1Oh, I just ran out of time. 1I'll continue this into the next video.",science_ap-physics-2_ap-fluids
" -  Let's now think a little bit more about how we might model population growth, and as we do so, we're gonna become a little bit more familiar with the types of formulas that you might see in an AP Biology formula sheet. So in a previous video, we introduced the idea of per capita growth rate of a population, and we used the letter r for that. And so let's say that the per capita growth rate for a population is 0.2. That means that on average, for every one individual in that population, a year later, it would have grown by 20%, by two-tenths. So for every one, you would now have 1.2 of that population a year later. Now, as we mentioned, many populations, or the ones that reproduced sexually, you'd need at least two, a male and a female, but there's populations of certain things that can just reproduce on their own. They can just bud, or they can divide, if we're talking about especially unicellular organisms. And from this notion, we can get a related notion, which is our maximum per capita growth rate of a population and let me just write that there. You could view this as your per capita growth rate if the population is not limited in any way, if there's ample resources. Water, food, land, territory, whatever that population needs to grow, but that still is talking about per capita growth rate of population, we're just viewing as, this is the unfettered one, this is the maximum. And from that, we can set up an exponential growth equation, and we've seen this in other videos where the rate of change of our population with respect to time, N is our population, so dN dt is our rate of change of population with respect to time. Or our population growth rate right over here, let me write this down. Population growth rate. If we're dealing with a population that in no way is being limited by its ecosystem, which in reality is not realistic, at some point you would be. Well then, the rate of growth of population is going to be your maximum per capita growth rate of population, times your population itself. And we could see it set up a little table here to see how these would relate to each other, so let me do that, let me set up a table. And so let's think about what the rate of change of population will be, our population growth rate, for certain populations. So let's think about what it's going to be, when our population is 100. When our population is 500, and when our population is 900. So, given these populations, what would be your population growth rate for each of them? Pause this video and try to answer that. Well, when our population is 100, our population growth rate is just going to be 0.2 times that. So 0.2, let me write this down, this is just going to be, dN dt is just going to be 0.2, our maximum per capita growth rate of population times our population, times 100, which is equal to 20. So we're going to grow per year by 20 when our population is 100. Now what about when our population is 500? What is going to be our population growth rate? Pause the video again and try to answer that. Well, once again, we just take our maximum per capita growth rate and multiply it times our population, so .2 times 500, our population growth rate is now 100. If we're talking about bunnies, and if our time is in years, this would be 100 bunnies per year, or 100 individuals per year. And let's think about it when our population is 900. What's our population growth rate then? Pause the video again. Alright, well we're just gonna take 0.2 times 900, so it is going to be 180 individuals per year. Now, as I just mentioned, this is talking about a somewhat unrealistic situation where a population can just grow and grow and grow and never be limited in any way. We know that land is limited, food is limited, water is limited. And so, there's this notion of a natural carrying capacity of a given population in a given environment. And to describe that, we'll use the letter K. And so let's say, for the organisms that we're studying here, let's say they're bunnies, and they're bunnies on a relatively small island, let's say that the natural carrying capacity for that island is 1000. The the island really can't support more than 1000 bunnies. So how would we change this exponential growth equation right over here, exponential, to reflect that? Well, what mathematicians and biologists have done is they've modified this, they multiplied this times the factor, to get us what's known as logistic growth. Logistic growth. So this is exponential growth, and what we're gonna now talk about is logistic growth. And what they do is they start with the exponential growth, so my population growth rate you could view as your maximum per capita growth rate, times your population, so that's exactly what we had right over here, but then they multiplied that by a factor so that this thing slows down the closer and closer we get to the carrying capacity. And the factor that they add is, your carrying capacity minus your population, over your carrying capacity. Now let's see if this makes intuitive sense. So let's set up another table here. And I'll do it with the same values. So let's say we have N, so our population, what's going to be our population growth when our population's 100, when it's 500, and when it's 900? So I encourage you, pause this video, and figure out what dN dt is at these various times. Well, at 100, it's going to be, I'll do this one, I'll write it out, it's going to be 0.2 times 100, times the carrying capacity is 1000, so it's gonna be 1000 minus 100, all of that over 1000. So this is 900 over 1000, this is going to be 0.9. And then 0.2 times 100 is 20, so 20 times 0.9, this is going to be equal to 18. So it's a little bit lower, it's being slowed down a little bit, but it's pretty close. Now let's see what happens when we get to N equals 500. Pause this video and figure what dN dt, our population growth rate, would be at that time. So in this case, it's going to be 0.2 times 500, times 500, times this factor here, which is now going to be 1000 minus 500, that's our population now, minus 500, all of that over 1000. Now what's this going to be? This is 100, which we had there, but it's going to be multiplied by 500 over 1000, which is .5. So we're only going to grow half as fast as we were in this situation. 'Cause once again, we don't have an infinite amount of resources here. So this is going to be 100 times .5, which is equal to 50. And then if you look at this scenario over here, when our population is 900, what is dN dt? Pause the video again. Well, it is going to be 0.2 times 900, which is 180, times this factor, which is going to be 1000 minus 900, all of that over 1000. So now this factor's going to be, 100 over 1000, which is .1, 0.1. This part right over here is, this part right over here is 180. 180 times 1/10th is going to be equal to 18. So now our population growth has slowed down. Why is that happening? Here, your population rate, the rate of growth is growing and growing and growing, because the more bunnies or whatever types of individuals you have, there's just more to reproduce, and they're just gonna keep growing exponentially. But here, they're getting closer and closer to the carrying capacity of whatever environment they're at. And so at 900, they're awfully close, so now you're gonna have some bunnies that are going hungry, and maybe they're not in the mood to reproduce as much, or maybe they're getting killed, or they're dying of, this is very unpleasant thinking, they're dying of starvation, or they're not able to get water, dehydration. Who knows what might be happening? And we could also think about this visually. If we were to make a quick graph right over here, where if this is time, and if this is population, our exponential growth right here would describe something that looks like this. So, for exponential growth, our population will grow like this. The more our population is, the faster it grows, the more it is, the faster it grows, the more it is, the faster it grows, and it'll just keep going forever until it, just, there's no limit in theory. And obviously, we know that's not realistic. Now with logistic growth, I'll do this in red, in logistic growth, in the beginning it looks a lot like exponential growth, it's just a little bit slower. But then as the population gets higher and higher, it gets a good bit slower, and it's limited by the natural carrying capacity of the environment for that population. So K would be right over there. It would asymptote up to it, but not quite approach it. And if you wanted to get the limit, what would happen? Well, what happens at a population of 1000 in this circumstance? Well then, this factor right over here just becomes zero, so your population at that point just wouldn't grow anymore if you were to even get there.",science_ap-biology_ecology-ap
" So for the last 20, 30 years, we've noticed this increase in autism. I'm actually going to quickly sketch out a graph to show you what I mean. We have autism rates over here. And if you follow them over time, basically what happens is that you see that things are going upwards. And the main reason that people cite is awareness. They say, well, if more parents and families are aware of autism because we talk about it more nowadays, then of course, they're going to bring it up with their doctors and it's going to get diagnosed. And although that may be one reason for the increase, people have been searching for other reasons to explain the increase as well. Now in 1998, there was a team of doctors and researchers that put together a study, a study that we call the Wakefield Study. It's named after the main author, which was a guy named Dr. Wakefield. He was a surgeon working in England. And, in total there were 13 people, 13 authors on this study. So this study was done in the United Kingdom, the UK. And what they did is they took 12 children, and these children came into the hospital, reportedly the normal way, the routine way that children come into the hospital. They weren't recruited. And he found that they had developmental problems. So these are 12 children with some sort of developmental problem or delay, and the most common example of a developmental problem among these kids was autism. So a lot of these kids ended up having a diagnosis of autism. And what they did-- I'm actually going to sketch out for you. So let's imagine that this is the head of one of our children. What he asked them was, do they have any symptoms? When did their symptoms start? All of these kinds of things to get at their history, their medical history. And a lot of the families said, well, you know, we remember them having these symptoms of autism, which I'm drawing as a grayed-out brain, and there seems to be-- this is the parents talking now. They felt like there was some sort of relationship with the vaccine. They felt like they remembered the vaccine, specifically the MMR vaccine, the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, around the time that symptoms began, and that's what he reported. So we actually have now a relationship based in terms of parents' recollection between the vaccine and autism. But what this study was mainly about was actually the gut. So he was a surgeon and he wanted to look at the intestines of these kids and he noticed that on the intestinal biopsies-- when you actually got a little bit of tissue from these intestines-- a lot of them had inflammation. That was what his paper was primarily about, was this inflammation that he saw. So he proposed-- and this is a big deal. He proposed that vaccine was causing this inflammation. He thought that was the cause of the inflammation, and he then thought that perhaps there was some mystery protein-- let's say this blue little protein-- that maybe you take in through your diet, that now, because it's inflamed, can get across the gut and can affect the developing brain. So this was how he proposed there could be a link between the vaccine and autism. Now when the Wakefield Study first came out in 1998, you can imagine the kind of excitement this created for a lot of parents and families that had been for years looking for something to explain why their kid had autism. And so, finally, people could circle this and say, ah, maybe it was the vaccine that caused autism, and that's what people thought. But there were a couple of problems with this idea. The first problem was that some of the patients that had autism symptoms, they actually reported that they were having these symptoms before they had any of the gut symptoms. Now think about that. If you're having autism symptoms before gut symptoms, not after, then that really goes against this theory, because this theory is based around the idea that it's the gut that comes first. So immediately, this is one concern and a big question mark over here whether this is really true. Another question mark is around this mystery protein. I'll put it up here. So this mystery protein-- this is something that Wakefield never really identified. He never said, well, I think it's this protein or that one. And in the last 15 plus years, nobody's found any mystery proteins that would explain what Wakefield was suggesting. So the fact that nobody can actually find these proteins is also another big question-mark. Nevertheless, a lot of studies started getting done. People started saying, well, if there truly is a relationship between vaccines and autism, then let's explore that further. So a group of studies were done around MMR vaccine rates. How often in a population do you actually see people getting the MMR vaccine? And you'd imagine that if there truly is a link between vaccine causing autism-- if that's true, then, of course, the vaccine rates must be going up. That would explain the autism going up. And so they actually looked in a few different places, and, of course, the first place to talk about it is the UK, because, of course, this study was initially done in the UK. And in the UK, they looked over six years, and they found that, actually, MMR vaccine rates had been steady. There had not been an increase. So already this is a little weird if we're thinking that the vaccine is causing autism. You'd expect something different. So they looked again. They actually looked another time. This time they actually looked in the US. And in the United States they did this study over 15 years. And over 15 years, the same thing, steady vaccine rates even though autism rates were going up. Now another study was actually done, this time in Canada and, surprisingly, in Canada it turns out that the vaccine rates were actually going down slightly. So vaccine rates over 12 years now went down, even though autism rates were going up. So this data is done at the population level, but it really does go against this idea that vaccine is causing autism. But people weren't satisfied with that. They wanted more specific research to be done on this mechanism that Dr. Wakefield proposed. So another study was done. It actually was done in the United Kingdom, and this study looked at 473 autistic children. So remember, the initial study was done on 12 children, and now we're looking at hundreds of children with autism, and among these 473, they actually wanted to figure out this part of it. They said, is there a link between vaccine and any sort of gut inflammation and the answer was a resounding no. There doesn't seem to be any relationship in autistic kids with vaccine, MMR vaccine and inflammation of the gut. So that was actually very detrimental to Wakefield's theory. But what about the second part, the second link between gut inflammation and any sort of autism, this part right here? Well, again, another study in the UK looking this time at 262 autistic children found that there was no link between these two things. So gut inflammation and autism did not seem to be related at all. So now the two important components of Wakefield's idea didn't seem to bear out. And then I should also just cross this off, this mystery protein bit, because, again, people have been looking for that, and no one seemed to find that. But that wasn't good enough because you could say, well, maybe there still is some link between vaccine and autism, but maybe this mechanism wasn't quite right. So research got done on this purple arrow over here. So they said, OK, what about this? Could it be possible that there's a link between the two using some other mechanism. And so a study was done in the UK, specifically looking at MMR vaccine and autism. Is there a relationship? And it turns out that they, in this study, looked at 71 autistic children, and they found that among these children there was no relationship. And this study was actually in a way done again. In fact, in another setting done in a different way, but also trying to answer the same question of a link between vaccine and autism in Finland this time. They found that among 309 autistic children, there was no link. Now, remember this link that we created was done among 12 children and now we have hundreds and hundreds of kids in different countries. Another one was done in the US. And all these studies are finding the same result, that basically there were no links that they could find between vaccine and autism. And so people started really doubting the truth behind that very first study, that first study done on 12 kids. But people were still talking about it and said, you know, what about that Wakefield Study? Isn't it possible that there could still be a link in spite of all this other evidence? So, finally, a group out of Finland tried to do another type of study, a different approach, that they thought would conclusively answer the question. They basically said, well fine. Why don't we follow 1.8 million children. So obviously this is many, many children that are getting vaccinated and just follow them over time and see if they develop autism, and this might answer once and for all whether there's a link. And so they followed these kids over time, and they found a grand total of zero cases of vaccine-associated autism. So in all these cases of vaccination, none of them resulted in autism. So at this point, people really stopped believing the study, the Wakefield Study, and whether there was any link. That was kind of resolved. All of these studies said, no, there was really no link between vaccine and autism, but a question remained around the Wakefield Study and how those results were found in the first place. I'm actually going to pause right there and we'll jump into that in the next video.",science_health-and-medicine_infectious-diseases
" -  One of the most amazing moments for a woman is when she finds out she's pregt, or I guess I should say when her brain finds out because her body is already aware of it from several weeks before. So much so that by the time a woman finds out that she's about to be a mom, her body has already undergone several changes to prepare for that growing baby. One of the first and most important changes that the body makes is that it realizes that it needs more oxygen, which means that it needs more red blood cells to carry the oxygen within the blood. And in order to do that, the level of a hormone called Erythropoietin have to increase. And Erythropoietin is this hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to increase production of red blood cells. And those levels don't increase by just a little. They increase up to 50%. In fact, if the pregt body could have its way with things, the amount of red blood cells would increase by something like 20% to 30% over the course of a pregcy. But what actually ends up happening a lot of the time in pregcy, is that women become anemic, so the hemoglobin and the hematocrit values, which are measures of the amount of red blood cells you have in the blood, decrease. Instead of increasing, they decrease. And that can happen for a couple of different reasons. The first reason is something that happens in normal, pregt women, and that is that the plasma volume, which plasma is like the liquid component of blood, the plasma volume increases more than the red blood cell mass. So even though the amount of red blood cells is increasing, the concentration of red blood cells in the blood is decreasing. Does that make sense? So that's the first thing. And it's called a physiologic anemia, because it's a part of normal pregcy physiology. Now, another thing that can happen is a true anemia, or a pathological process, not a physiological process, but a pathological process, in which there is an actual decrease in the number of red blood cells. So here we're not talking about concentration, we're talking about a decrease in the actual number of red blood cells. Most commonly, that anemia, the true anemia, is due to a shortage of iron in the body. So iron is used to make hemoglobin, it's an essential part of hemoglobin, and red blood cells are basically packets of hemoglobin. So no iron means no red blood cells. It's kind of like, if you're going to go make chocolate chip cookies and you want to make, let's say, 100 of them, and you have enough of all of the ingredients to make 100 cookies, but you only have enough chocolate chips to make 80 cookies. So guess what? You're gonna end up with only 80 chocolate chip cookies. So why the shortage of iron? Why is there a shortage of iron in pregcy? Well, these women, the pregt women, are by definition, women of reproductive age, right? So they were probably menstruating before becoming pregt, and that blood loss that occurs with each menstrual cycle claims some of the body's iron stores. So, that's one cause for the iron shortage in pregcy. Another cause is that, in trying to make it's own red blood cells, the fetus claims some of mom's iron stores. Now, iron deficiency is, by far, the most common cause of anemia in pregcy. So much so, that if a woman is a pregt woman is found to be anemic, she is usually treated with iron supplementation, and only if that doesn't resolve the anemia, if the supplementation doesn't resolve the anemia, do we go looking for another cause. So speaking of other causes, it's worth mentioned that folic acid deficiency, so, deficiency of folic acid, right? can also, less commonly, cause anemia in pregcy, as can other causes, all the other regular causes of anemia. And something that happens particularly in pregcy is that the lifespan of a red blood cell decreases, so the red blood cell doesn't quite live to be 120-days old before dying, and this further contributes to the anemia that we tend to see in pregcy. So, I want to make the point that anemia isn't a problem that's unique to pregt women, and you probably already know that, but anemia does have some unique implications in pregcy that it doesn't have in other people. For example, it can lead to things, such as, a reduction in amniotic fluid levels in the fetus. It can cause concerning fetal heart tones or fetal heart tracings. It can lead to spontaneous abortion, low birth weight of the fetus, and even death of the fetus, so it can be a pretty serious problem in pregcy. Now, there's another important change that occurs in the blood system of the mom during pregcy, and that is that pregcy is a hypercoagulable state, so that is to say that the clotting mechanisms in blood are running in overdrive during pregcy, so blood clots really easily, and this is primarily because in pregcy, there is an increase in the production of clotting factors. Factors such as thombrin and fibrinogen and other clotting factors are made more. And there is a lot of thought that perhaps this occurs to protect the mother from excessive bleeding during delivery, especially the bleeding that occurs when the placenta separates from the uterus. So maybe this is all meant to be protective? The problem is, is that sometimes you can have too much of a good thing, and you end up with blood clots, most commonly in the deep veins of the legs. And some of that actually has to do with the fact that the enlarging uterus puts pressure on the inferior vena cava and the veins of the legs. And that causes blood to pull in the lower extremities, which is actually why pregt ladies almost always complain of swollen legs. Anyways, this pooling of blood in the legs can lead to blood clots, and those blood clots are called deep vein thrombosis. Thrombosis just means clot. So, in fact, the risk of having a deep vein thrombosis is increased by five-fold in pregcy and it's important to know because the clot in the legs can break off and it can travel to the lungs leading to a pulmonary embolus, in up to 40% of cases in which you have DVT, which is dangerous and potentially fatal to the mom. So, when the presence of a DVT or any clot or thromboembolism, for that matter, is confirmed, the woman is put on anticoagulant therapy right away. So those are just a couple of the very important changes that occur in the blood system of a pregt woman.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" -  So let's say I have two functions that are the inverse of each other. So I have f of x, and then I also have g of x, which is equal to the inverse of f of x. And f of x would be the inverse of g of x as well. If the notion of an inverse function is completely unfamiliar to you, I encourage you to review inverse functions on Khan Academy. Now, one of the properties of inverse functions are that if I were to take g of f of x, g of f of x, or I could say the f inverse of f of x, that this is just going to be equal to x. And it comes straight out of what an inverse of a function is. If this is x right over here, the function f would map to some value f of x. So that's f of x right over there. And then the function g, or f inverse, if you input f of x into it, it would take you back, it would take you back to x. So that would be f inverse, or we're saying g is the same thing as f inverse. So all of that so far is a review of inverse functions, but now we're going to apply a little bit of calculus to it, using the chain rule. And we're gonna get a pretty interesting result. What I want to do is take the derivative of both sides of this equation right over here. So let's apply the derivative operator, d/dx on the left-hand side, d/dx on the right-hand side. And what are we going to get? Well, on the left-hand side, we would apply the chain rule. So this is going to be the derivative of g with respect to f of x. So that's going to be g prime of f of x, g prime of f of x, times the derivative of f of x with respect to x, so times f prime of x. And then that is going to be equal to what? Well, the derivative with respect to x of x, that's just equal to one. And this is where we get our interesting result. All we did so far is we used something we knew about inverse functions, and we'd use the chain rule to take the derivative of the left-hand side. But if you divide both sides by g prime of f of x, what are you going to get? You're going to get a relationship between the derivative of a function and the derivative of its inverse. So you get f prime of x is going to be equal to one over all of this business, one over g prime of f of x, g prime of f of x. And this is really neat because if you know something about the derivative of a function, you can then start to figure out things about the derivative of its inverse. And we can actually see this is true with some classic functions. So let's say that f of x is equal to e to the x, and so g of x would be equal to the inverse of f. So f inverse, which is, what's the inverse of e to the x? Well, one way to think about it is, if you have y is equal to e to the x, if you want the inverse, you can swap the variables and then solve for y again. So you'd get x is equal to e to the y. You take the natural log of both sides, you get natural log of x is equal to y. So the inverse of e to the x is natural log of x. And once again, that's all review of inverse functions. All right, if that's unfamiliar, review it on Khan Academy. So g of x is going to be equal to the natural log of x. Now, let's see if this holds true for these two functions. Well, what is f prime of x going to be? Well, this one of those amazing results in calculus. One of these neat things about the number e is that the derivative of e to the x is e to the x. And in other videos, we also saw that the derivative of the natural log of x is one over x. So let's see if this holds out. So we should get a result, f prime of x, e to the x should be equal to one over g prime of f of x. So g prime of f of x, so g prime is one over our f of x, and f of x is e to the x, one over e to the x. Is this indeed true? Yes, it is. One over, one over e to the x is just going to be e to the x. So it all checks out. And you could do the other way because these are inverses of each other. You could say g prime of x is going to be equal to one over f prime of g of x because they're inverses of each other. And actually, what's really neat about this, is that you could actually use this to get a sense of what the derivative of an inverse function is even going to be.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-derivatives-advanced
" When we wire blocks together, we will often run into a problem, and it's a range mismatch. For example, if we had the light intensity value being plugged into the pitch input of the speaker, let's see what would happen. Our light intensity value will send it a number between 0 and 100. However, the pitch input varies from 0 to 1,000, because it is a different measure. So these are all the different tones. If we think of it as a piano, this is the whole width of the piano. So if we'd plug these in directly, we actually would only hit 10% of all the values here, and this means this number would need to be scaled by some amount. And that is when we can use our math block to help us. The math block is very simple. It takes two inputs, A and B, which you can plug into just like I've shown you, and it spits out an output. So what you could do is multiply things together, or scale a number, or say, take whatever A is and add 5 to it and spit that as your output. So in this case, I have a light sensor and a sound sensor, and instead of plugging them together, I'm going to drop a math block in between them. And now provide the light intensity value to A-- that's the first input-- and I'm not going to give it another input B because I just want to either add, multiply, or do something to this number, A. And I'll take the result of whatever operation we come up with and plug it into tone frequency. So in the math block, just to be clear, the operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, absolute value, and square root, so you should select the correct operation here and fill in B. So let's say we wanted to divide it by 5. I would put 5 in the box for B. So if I provided the number 50, it would be divided by 5, which is 10, and 10 would spit out the other end. So fix this so that after the math block, the value ranges from 0 to 1,000.",science_electrical-engineering_lego-robotics
" -  Let's say we have some type of hard, flat, frictionless surface right over here. That's my drawing of a hard, flat, frictionless surface. And on that, I have a block, and that block is not accelerating in any direction. It is just sitting there. And let's say we know the weight of that block. It is a 10-newton block. So my question to you is, pause this video, and think about what are all of the forces that are acting on this block? All right, now let's work through this together. And to do it, I'm going to draw what's known as a free-body diagram to think about all of the forces. And the reason why it's called a free-body diagram is that we just focus on this one body. And we don't draw everything else around it, and we just draw the forces acting on it. And there's actually two typical ways of drawing a free-body diagram. I'll do them both. So first, I could draw it this way. So this is my block here. Now, I told you that it weighs 10 newtons. The weight of an object, that's the force of gravity acting on that object, and it would be downwards. So we have, from this 10 newtons right over here, we know that there is a downward force, the force of gravity acting on the mass of this object of 10 newtons. It has a magnitude of 10 newtons, and the force is acting downwards. We could say this is the magnitude of the force of gravity. And when you draw a free-body diagram, it's typical to show your vectors originating out of the center of that, of that object in your drawing. Now, my question to you is, is that the only force acting on this? If you think it is, what would happen to the object? Well, it would start or it would be accelerating downwards. But I just said that this is not accelerating in any direction. So there must be something that counteracts this, and there is. There's the normal force of this surface acting on the block. That surface is what's keeping the block from accelerating downwards. And I will do that with this vector right over here. So it's going to be going upwards, and it's going to have the exact same magnitude, just in the opposite direction. So I could say the magnitude of the normal force, the normal force is magnitude right over here, is also going to be equal to 10 newtons, but it's going upwards. And we can see that these two are going to net out, and so you have no net force acting in this vertical dimension. And I have no forces, I haven't thought about any or drawn any in the horizontal direction. And so that's why you have no net force in total, and this thing isn't going to be accelerated. Now, I mentioned that there's other ways to draw a free-body diagram. Another way that you might see it is like this, where you see the body. And from the outside of the body, you see the vectors being drawn. So in this situation, you have ten newtons downward, and you would have ten newtons upward. This is another way that you might see free-body diagrams drawn. Now, what I want to do is do something interesting to this block. Let me redraw it. So I have my surface here, my hard, frictionless surface, and it's flat. And I still have my block here. It's my 10-newton block. But now I'm going to apply a force to it. I am going to apply a force that is in this direction. It's in this direction, and its magnitude, let's say its magnitude is 20 newtons. And just so that we know the direction, this angle right over here, let's say that that is 60 degrees. I'll say theta is equal to 60 degrees. The magnitude of this force is equal to 20 newtons. So what would the free-body diagram now look like? Well, it might be tempting to just draw the force right on one of these free-body diagrams, something like that, something like that, and that would not be inaccurate. But we would have to watch out because this force is acting at an angle. So if we were to break it up into its horizontal and vertical components, some part of that force is acting downward. And so you're actually going to have a larger normal force to counteract that. And some other component is going to be working horizontally. And so what we want to do is actually break things up. 'Cause if you leave it in this angle, it gets very, very confusing. So what I want to do is I want to break up this new blue force into its horizontal and vertical components. And to do so, we just have to remember a little bit of our basic trigonometry. If I have a force like this, if I have a force like this and it is acting at an angle theta right over here, with the horizontal, and I want to break it up into its horizontal and its vertical components, and its vertical components, if the magnitude of the hypotenuse is capital F, then the magnitude of the adjacent side to this angle, this comes straight out of soh-cah-toa, from our right triangle trigonometry, it would be the magnitude of our hypotenuse times the cosine of this angle. And the magnitude of the vertical component, that would be the magnitude of our hypotenuse times the sine of that angle. And you could think about it the other way as well, if the force was like this, where it's just going in the opposite direction. But once again, you have this angle theta. And now the components would look like this, where the vertical component would have the same magnitude, but now it would be pointing downwards. And the horizontal component would have the same magnitude, but now it is pointing to the left. It is the same idea. If this force has magnitude F that's represented by the hypotenuse of this triangle, then the magnitude of our horizontal component is still going to be F cosine theta. The vector is not going in the other direction. And the magnitude of our vertical component here is going to be F sine theta. And so what about this scenario over here? Well, in this scenario, our vertical component is gonna look like this, and our horizontal component is going to look like this. And so what's the magnitude of our horizontal component? Well, it's going to be the magnitude of our hypotenuse times the cosine of the 60 degrees. So this is going to be 20 newtons times the cosine of 60 degrees. And it's really helpful, both trigonometry and physics classes, to know the values of your sines, your cosines, and your tangents at angles like zero degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 45 degrees. You could use a calculator here, but it's useful to know that the cosine of 60 degrees is 1/2. So 20 times 1/2, this is going to be equal to 10 newtons. And if we want to know the magnitude of our vertical component, well, this is going to be 20 newtons times the sine of 60 degrees. Once again, this is useful to know. It is square root of three over two. And so 20 divided by two is 10. So this is going to be 10 square root of three newtons. And so we can use that information. We've broken up our original vector into two component vectors that, if you took their sum, you would get your original one. But what's useful now is that we've broken it up into vectors that are parallel or perpendicular to our surface, which will allow us to think about what nets against these things that I already have in place. So let me draw that. So actually, I'll first draw this type of free-body diagram. So there is my block. And I have the force of gravity acting on it downwards. I will draw it right over here. So that's 10 newtons. That is the force of gravity acting downwards. Now, is that the only thing that I have acting downwards? No, I also have the vertical component of this applied force. And so this is going downwards 10 square roots of three newtons. And these aren't drawn perfectly to scale, but hopefully you get the idea. So this is 10 square roots of three newtons, just like that. And now what is our normal force, assuming that our surface is able to not be compressed in any way, that it is a hard, frictionless surface? Well, now our normal force is going to counteract both of these forces. Our normal force might look something like this. Once again, I haven't drawn it completely to scale. But this would be 10 plus 10 square roots of three newtons. And what about now in the horizontal direction? Well, I have this blue vector right here, and so that is going to the right with a magnitude of 10 newtons, 10 newtons. And so now you can hopefully appreciate why a free-body diagram is really, really, really useful. Just looking at this, I can predict what's going to happen to my block. I would say, look, this upward force is completely netted out by these downward forces, or these downward forces are completely netted out by this upward force. And the only net force that I have is ten newtons to the right. And so that lets me know that, hey, since I have a net force to the right, this block is going to accelerate to the right.",science_ap-physics-1_ap-forces-newtons-laws
" - [Voiceoer] This is from the graph basic exponential functions on Khan Academy. They asked us graph the following exponential function. And they give us the function, h of x is equal to 27 times 1/3 to the x. So our initial value is 27 and 1/3 is our common ratio. It's written in a standard exponential form. And it gives us some graphing tool where we can define these two points and we can also define a horizontal asymptote to construct our function. And these three things are enough to define to graph an exponential if we know that it is an exponential function. So let's think about it a little bit. So the easiest thing that I could think of is, well, let's think about its initial value. Its initial value is going to be x equal to zero. X equal zeros, 1/3 to the zero power is just one and so you're just left with 27 times one or just 27. That's what we call this number here when you've written in this form. You call this the initial value. So when x is equal to zero, h of x is equal to 27. Now we're graphing y=h(x). So now let's graph another point. So let's think about it a little bit. When x is equal to one, when x is equal to one, what is h of x? It's gonna be 1/3 to the first power which is just 1/3. And so 1/3 times 27 is gonna be nine. So when x is one, h of one is nine. And we can verify. And now let's just think about, let's think about the asymptote. So what's gonna happen here when x becomes really, really, really, really, really, really, really big? If I take 1/3 to like a really large exponent to, say to the 10th power or to the 100th power or to the 1000th power, this thing right over here is going to start approaching zero as x becomes much, much, much, much larger. And so something that is approaching zero times 27, well, that's going to approach zero as well. So we're gonna have a horizontal asymptote at zero. And you can verify that this works for more than just a two points we talk about. When x is equal to, this is telling us that the graph, y equals h of x goes to the point two comma three. So h of two should be equal to three. And you can verify that that is indeed the case. If x is two, 1/3 squared is nine. Oh sorry, 1/3 squared is 1/9 times 27 is three. And we see that right over here. When x is two, h of two is three. So I feel pretty good about that. Let's do another one of this. So graph the following exponential function. So same logic. When x is zero, the g of zero is just gonna boiled out to that initial value. And so you scroll down. Initial value is negative 30. And so let's think about when x is equal to one. When x is equal to one, two to the first power is just two. And so two times negative 30 is negative 60. So when x is equal to one, the value of the graph is negative 60. Now let's think about this asymptote over that, it should sit. So let's think about what happens when x becomes really, really, really, really, really, really negative. So when x is really negative, so two to the negative one power is 1/2. Two to the negative two is 1/4. Two to the negative three is 1/8. As it gets larger and larger negative or higher magnitude negative values or in other words, as x becomes more and more and more negative, two to that power is going to approach zero. And so negative 30 times something approaching zero is going to approach zero. So this asymptote is in the right place, a horizontal asymptote as x approaches negative infinity. As we move further and further to the left, the value of a function is going to approach zero. Now we can see it kind of approaches zero from below. We can see they approaches below because we already looked at the initial value and we used that common ratio to find one other point. Hopefully, you found that interesting.",math_algebra-home_alg-exp-and-log
" So what you're looking at is one of the most amazing organs in your body. This is the human heart. And it's shown with all the vessels on it. And you can see the vessels coming into it and out of it. But the heart, at its core, is a pump. And this pump is why we call it the hardest working organ in our body. Because it starts pumping blood from the point where you're a little fetus, maybe about eight weeks old, all the way until the point where you die. And so this organ, I think, would be really cool to look at in a little bit more detail. But it's hard to do that looking just at the outside. So what I did is I actually drew what it might look like on the inside. So let me actually just show you that now. And we'll follow the path of blood through the heart using this diagram. Let me start with a little picture in the corner. So let's say we have a person here. And this is their face, and this is their neck. I'm going to draw their arms. And they have, in the middle of their chest, their heart. And so the whole goal is to make sure that blood from all parts of their body, including their legs, can make its way back to the heart, first of all, and then get pumped back out to the body. So blood is going to come up from this arm, let's say, and dump into there. And the same on this side. And it's going to come from their head. And all three sources, the two arms and the head, are going to come together into one big vein. And that's going to be dumping into the top of the heart. And then separately, you've got veins from the legs meeting up with veins from the belly, coming into another opening into the heart. So that's how the blood gets back to the heart. And any time I mention the word vein, I just want you to make sure you think of blood going towards the heart. Now if blood is going towards the heart, then after the blood is pumped by the heart, it's going to have to go out to the heart. It's going to have to go away from the heart. So that's the aorta. And the aorta actually has a little arch, like that. We call it the aortic arch. And it sends off one vessel to the arm, one vessel up this way, a vessel over this way. And then this arch kind of goes down, down, down and splits like that. So this is kind of a simplified version of it. But you can see how there are definitely some parallels between how the veins and the arteries are set up. And arteries, anytime I mention the word artery, I want you to think of blood going away from the heart. And an easy way to remember that is that they both start with the letter A. So going to our big diagram now. We can see that blood coming in this way and blood coming in this way is ending up at the same spot. It's going to end up at the-- actually, maybe I'll draw it here-- is ending up at the right atrium. That's just the name of the chamber that the blood ends up in. And it came into the right atrium from a giant vessel up top called the superior vena cava. And this is a vein, of course, because it's bringing blood towards the heart. And down here, the inferior vena cava. So these are the two directions that blood is going to be flowing. And once blood is in the right atrium, it's going to head down into the right ventricle. So this is the right ventricle, down here. This is the second chamber of the heart. And it gets there by passing through a valve. And this valve, and all valves in the heart, are basically there to keep blood moving in the right direction. So it doesn't go in the backwards direction. So this valve is called the tricuspid valve. And it's called that because it's basically got three little flaps. That's why they call it tri. And I know you can only see two in my drawing, and that's just because my drawing is not perfect. And it's hard to show a flap coming out at you, but you can imagine it. So blood goes into the right ventricle. And where does it go next? Well after that, it's going to go this way. It's going to go into this vessel, and it's going to split. But before it goes there, it has to pass through another valve. So this is a valve, right here, called the pulmonary valve. And it gives you a clue as to where things are going to go next. Right? Because the word pulmonary means lungs. And so, if this is my lung, on this side, this is my left lung. And this is my right lung, on this side. Then these vessels-- and I'll let you try to guess what they would be called-- these vessels. This would be my-- I want to make sure I get my right and left straight. This is my left pulmonary artery. And I hesitated there just to make sure you got that because it's taking blood away from the heart. And this is my right pulmonary artery. So this is my right and left pulmonary artery. And so blood goes, now, into my lungs. These are the lungs that are kind of nestled into my thorax, where my heart is sitting. It goes into my lungs. And remember, this blood is blue. Why is it blue? Well, it's blue because it doesn't have very much oxygen. And so one thing that I need to pick up is oxygen. And so that's one thing that the lungs are going to help me pick up. And I'm going to write O2 for oxygen. And it's also blue. And that reminds us that it's full of carbon dioxide. It's full of waste because it's coming from the body. And the body's made a lot of carbon dioxide that it's trying to get rid of. So in the lungs, you get rid of your carbon dioxide and you pick up oxygen. So that's why I switch, at this point, from a blue-colored vessel to a red-colored vessel. So now blood comes back in this way and this way and dumps into this chamber. So what is that? This is our left atrium. So just like our right atrium, we have one on the left. And it goes down into-- and you can probably guess what this one is called-- it's our left ventricle. So just like before, where it went from the right atrium to the right ventricle, now we're going from the left atrium to the left ventricle. And it passes through a valve here. So this valve is called the mitral valve. And its job is, of course, to make sure that blood does not go from the left ventricle back to the left atrium by accident. It wants to make sure that there's forward flow. And then the final valve-- I have to find a nice spot to write it, maybe right here. This final valve that it passes through is called the aortic valve. And the aortic valve is going to be what divides the left ventricle from this giant vessel that we talked about earlier. And this is, of course, the aorta. This is my aorta. So now blood is going to go through the aorta to the rest of the body. So you can see how blood now flows from the body into the four chambers. First into the right atrium-- this is chamber number one. And then it goes into the right ventricle. This is chamber number two. It goes to the lungs and then back out to the left atrium. So this is chamber number three. And then the left ventricle. And this happens every moment of every day. Every time you hear your heart beating, this process is going on.",science_health-and-medicine_human-anatomy-and-physiology
" So I've got an arbitrary triangle here. We'll call it triangle ABC. And what I want to do is look at the midpoints of each of the sides of ABC. So this is the midpoint of one of the sides, of side BC. Let's call that point D. Let's call this midpoint E. And let's call this midpoint right over here F. And since it's the midpoint, we know that the distance between BD is equal to the distance from D to C. So this distance is equal to this distance. We know that AE is equal to EC, so this distance is equal to that distance. And we know that AF is equal to FB, so this distance is equal to this distance. Instead of drawing medians going from these midpoints to the vertices, what I want to do is I want to connect these midpoints and see what happens. So if I connect them, I clearly have three points. So if you connect three non-linear points like this, you will get another triangle. And this triangle that's formed from the midpoints of the sides of this larger triangle-- we call this a medial triangle. And that's all nice and cute by itself. But what we're going to see in this video is that the medial triangle actually has some very neat properties. What we're actually going to show is that it divides any triangle into four smaller triangles that are congruent to each other, that all four of these triangles are identical to each other. And they're all similar to the larger triangle. And you could think of them each as having 1/4 of the area of the larger triangle. So let's go about proving it. So first, let's focus on this triangle down here, triangle CDE. And it looks similar to the larger triangle, to triangle CBA. But let's prove it to ourselves. So one thing we can say is, well, look, both of them share this angle right over here. Both the larger triangle, triangle CBA, has this angle. And the smaller triangle, CDE, has this angle. So they definitely share that angle. And then let's think about the ratios of the sides. We know that the ratio of CD to CB is equal to 1 over 2. This is 1/2 of this entire side, is equal to 1 over 2. And that's the same thing as the ratio of CE to CA. CE is exactly 1/2 of CA, because E is the midpoint. It's equal to CE over CA. So we have an angle, corresponding angles that are congruent, and then the ratios of two corresponding sides on either side of that angle are the same. CD over CB is 1/2, CE over CA is 1/2, and the angle in between is congruent. So by SAS similarity, we know that triangle CDE is similar to triangle CBA. And just from that, you can get some interesting results. Because then we know that the ratio of this side of the smaller triangle to the longer triangle is also going to be 1/2. Because the other two sides have a ratio of 1/2, and we're dealing with similar triangles. So this is going to be 1/2 of that. And we know 1/2 of AB is just going to be the length of FA. So we know that this length right over here is going to be the same as FA or FB. And we get that straight from similar triangles. Because these are similar, we know that DE over BA has got to be equal to these ratios, the other corresponding sides, which is equal to 1/2. And so that's how we got that right over there. Now let's think about this triangle up here. We could call it BDF. So first of all, if we compare triangle BDF to the larger triangle, they both share this angle right over here, angle ABC. They both have that angle in common. And we're going to have the exact same argument. You can just look at this diagram. And you know that the ratio of BA-- let me do it this way. The ratio of BF to BA is equal to 1/2, which is also the ratio of BD to BC. The ratio of this to that is the same as the ratio of this to that, which is 1/2. Because BD is 1/2 of this whole length. BF is 1/2 of that whole length. And so you have corresponding sides have the same ratio on the two triangles, and they share an angle in between. So once again, by SAS similarity, we know that triangle-- I'll write it this way-- DBF is similar to triangle CBA. And once again, we use this exact same kind of argument that we did with this triangle. Well, if it's similar, the ratio of all the corresponding sides have to be the same. And that ratio is 1/2. So the ratio of this side to this side, the ratio of FD to AC, has to be 1/2. Or FD has to be 1/2 of AC. And 1/2 of AC is just the length of AE. So that is just going to be that length right over there. I think you see where this is going. And also, because it's similar, all of the corresponding angles have to be the same. And we know that the larger triangle has a yellow angle right over there. So we'd have that yellow angle right over here. And this triangle right over here was also similar to the larger triangle. So it will have that same angle measure up here. We already showed that in this first part. So now let's go to this third triangle. I think you see the pattern. I'm sure you might be able to just pause this video and prove it for yourself. But we see that the ratio of AF over AB is going to be the same as the ratio of AE over AC, which is equal to 1/2. So we have two corresponding sides where the ratio is 1/2, from the smaller to larger triangle. And they share a common angle. They share this angle in between the two sides. So by SAS similarity-- this is getting repetitive now-- we know that triangle EFA is similar to triangle CBA. And so the ratio of all of the corresponding sides need to be 1/2. So the ratio of FE to BC needs to be 1/2, or FE needs to be 1/2 of that, which is just the length of BD. So this is just going to be that length right over there. And you can also say that since we've shown that this triangle, this triangle, and this triangle-- we haven't talked about this middle one yet-- they're all similar to the larger triangle. So they're also all going to be similar to each other. So they're all going to have the same corresponding angles. So if the larger triangle had this yellow angle here, then all of the triangles are going to have this yellow angle right over there. And if the larger triangle had this blue angle right over here, then in the corresponding vertex, all of the triangles are going to have that blue angle. All of the ones that we've shown are similar. We haven't thought about this middle triangle just yet. And of course, if this is similar to the whole, it'll also have this angle at this vertex right over here, because this corresponds to that vertex, based on the similarity. So that's interesting. Now let's compare the triangles to each other. We've now shown that all of these triangles have the exact same three sides. Has this blue side-- or actually, this one-mark side, this two-mark side, and this three-mark side. One mark, two mark, three mark. One mark, two mark, three mark. And that even applies to this middle triangle right over here. So by side-side-side congruency, we now know-- and we want to be careful to get our corresponding sides right-- we now know that triangle CDE is congruent to triangle DBF. I want to get the corresponding sides. I'm looking at the colors. I went from yellow to magenta to blue, yellow, magenta, to blue, which is going to be congruent to triangle EFA, which is going to be congruent to this triangle in here. But we want to make sure that we're getting the right corresponding sides here. So to make sure we do that, we just have to think about the angles. So we know-- and this is interesting-- that because the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees, we know this magenta angle plus this blue angle plus this yellow angle equal 180. Here, we have the blue angle and the magenta angle, and clearly they will all add up to 180. So you must have the blue angle. The blue angle must be right over here. Same argument-- yellow angle and blue angle, we must have the magenta angle right over here. They add up to 180. So this must be the magenta angle. And then finally, magenta and blue-- this must be the yellow angle right over there. And so when we wrote the congruency here, we started at CDE. We went yellow, magenta, blue. So over here, we're going to go yellow, magenta, blue. So it's going to be congruent to triangle FED. 1And so that's pretty cool. 1We just showed that all three, that this triangle, 1this triangle, this triangle, and that triangle 1are congruent. 1And also, we can look at the corresponding-- 1and that they all have ratios relative to-- they're 1all similar to the larger triangle, to triangle ABC. 1And that the ratio between the sides is 1 to 2. 1And also, because we've looked at corresponding angles, 1we see, for example, that this angle 1is the same as that angle. 1So if you viewed DC or if you viewed BC 1as a transversal, all of a sudden 1it becomes pretty clear that FD is going to be parallel to AC, 1because the corresponding angles are congruent. 1So this is going to be parallel to that right over there. 1And then you could use that same exact argument 1to say, well, then this side, because once again, 1corresponding angles here and here-- you 1could say that this is going to be 1parallel to that right over there. 1And then finally, you make the same argument over here. 1I want to make sure I get the right corresponding angles. 1You have this line and this line. 1And this angle corresponds to that angle. 1They're the same. 1So this DE must be parallel to BA. 1So that's another neat property of this medial triangle, 1[? I thought. ?] All of these things 1just jump out when you just try to do something fairly simple 1with a triangle.",math_engageny-geo_geo-1
" In the last video we were able to show that any lambda that satisfies this equation for some non-zero vectors, V, then the determit of lambda times the identity matrix minus A, must be equal to 0. Or if we could rewrite this as saying lambda is an eigenvalue of A if and only if-- I'll write it as if-- the determit of lambda times the identity matrix minus A is equal to 0. Now, let's see if we can actually use this in any kind of concrete way to figure out eigenvalues. So let's do a simple 2 by 2, let's do an R2. Let's say that A is equal to the matrix 1, 2, and 4, 3. And I want to find the eigenvalues of A. So if lambda is an eigenvalue of A, then this right here tells us that the determit of lambda times the identity matrix, so it's going to be the identity matrix in R2. So lambda times 1, 0, 0, 1, minus A, 1, 2, 4, 3, is going to be equal to 0. Well what does this equal to? This right here is the determit. Lambda times this is just lambda times all of these terms. So it's lambda times 1 is lambda, lambda times 0 is 0, lambda times 0 is 0, lambda times 1 is lambda. And from that we'll subtract A. So you get 1, 2, 4, 3, and this has got to equal 0. And then this matrix, or this difference of matrices, this is just to keep the determit. This is the determit of. This first term's going to be lambda minus 1. The second term is 0 minus 2, so it's just minus 2. The third term is 0 minus 4, so it's just minus 4. And then the fourth term is lambda minus 3, just like that. So kind of a shortcut to see what happened. The terms along the diagonal, well everything became a negative, right? We negated everything. And then the terms around the diagonal, we've got a lambda out front. That was essentially the byproduct of this expression right there. So what's the determit of this 2 by 2 matrix? Well the determit of this is just this times that, minus this times that. So it's lambda minus 1, times lambda minus 3, minus these two guys multiplied by each other. So minus 2 times minus 4 is plus eight, minus 8. This is the determit of this matrix right here or this matrix right here, which simplified to that matrix. And this has got to be equal to 0. And the whole reason why that's got to be equal to 0 is because we saw earlier, this matrix has a non-trivial null space. And because it has a non-trivial null space, it can't be invertible and its determit has to be equal to 0. So now we have an interesting polynomial equation right here. We can multiply it out. We get what? Let's multiply it out. We get lambda squared, right, minus 3 lambda, minus lambda, plus 3, minus 8, is equal to 0. Or lambda squared, minus 4 lambda, minus 5, is equal to 0. And just in case you want to know some terminology, this expression right here is known as the characteristic polynomial. Just a little terminology, polynomial. But if we want to find the eigenvalues for A, we just have to solve this right here. This is just a basic quadratic problem. And this is actually factorable. Let's see, two numbers and you take the product is minus 5, when you add them you get minus 4. It's minus 5 and plus 1, so you get lambda minus 5, times lambda plus 1, is equal to 0, right? Minus 5 times 1 is minus 5, and then minus 5 lambda plus 1 lambda is equal to minus 4 lambda. So the two solutions of our characteristic equation being set to 0, our characteristic polynomial, are lambda is equal to 5 or lambda is equal to minus 1. So just like that, using the information that we proved to ourselves in the last video, we're able to figure out that the two eigenvalues of A are lambda equals 5 and lambda equals negative 1. Now that only just solves part of the problem, right? We know we're looking for eigenvalues and eigenvectors, right? We know that this equation can be satisfied with the lambdas equaling 5 or minus 1. So we know the eigenvalues, but we've yet to determine the actual eigenvectors. So that's what we're going to do in the next video.",math_linear-algebra_alternate-bases
" Before we get into the meat of algebra, I wanted to give you a quote from one of the greatest minds in human history, Galileo Galilei, because I think this quote encapsulates the true point of algebra and really mathematics in general. He said, ""Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes-- I mean the universe-- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth."" So very dramatic, but very deep. And this really is the point of mathematics. And what we'll see as we start getting deeper and deeper into algebra is that we're going to start abstracting things, and we're going to start getting to core ideas that start explaining really how the universe is structured. Sure, these ideas can be applied to things like economics and fice and physics and chemistry. But at their core, they're the same idea, and so they're even more fundamental, more pure, than any one of those applications. And to see what I mean by getting down to the root idea, let's go with a-- I guess we started with the very grand, the philosophy of the universe is written in mathematics-- but let's start with a very concrete, simple idea. But we'll keep abstracting, and we'll see how the same idea connects across many domains in our universe. So let's just say we're at the store, and we're going to buy something. And there is a sale. The sale says that it is 30% percent off, and I'm interested. I don't shop at too fancy a store. So let's say I'm interested in a pair of pants. And the pair of pants before the sale even is about $20. And that is about how much I spend on my pants. So I'm interested in a $20 pair of pants. But it's even better, there's a 30% off sale on these pants. Well, how would I think about how much I'm going to get off of that $20? And this isn't algebra yet. This is something that you've probably had exposure to. You would multiply the 30% times the $20. So you would say your discount is equal to-- you could write it as 30% times $20. I'll do the $20 in purple. Or you could write it, if you wanted to write this as a decimal, you could write this as 0.30 times $20. And if you were to do the math, you would get $6. So nothing new over there. But what if I want to generalize it a little bit? That's the discount on this particular pair of pants. But what if I wanted to know the discount on anything in the store? Well, then I could say, well, let x be the price-- let me do this in a different color. So I'm just going to make a symbol. Let x be the price of the product I want to buy, price, the non-discount price of the product in the store. So now, all of a sudden, we can say that our discount is equal to 30% times x. Or if we wanted to write it as a decimal, if we wanted to write 30% as a decimal, we could write 0.30 times x. Now, this is interesting. Now you give me the price of any product in the store, and I can substitute it in for x. And then I can essentially multiply 0.3 times that, and I would get the discount. So now we're starting to, very slowly, we're starting to get into the abstraction of algebra. And we'll see that these will get much more nuanced and deep and, frankly, more beautiful as we start studying more and more kind of algebraic ideas. But we aren't done here. We can abstract this even more. Over here, we've said we've generalized this for any product. We're not just saying for this $20 product. If there's a $10 product, we can put that $10 product in here for x. And then we would say 0.30 times 10, and the discount would be $3. It might be $100 product, then the discount would be $30. But let's generalize even more. Let's say, well, what is the discount for any given sale when the sale is a certain percentage? So now we can say that the discount-- let me define a variable. So let's let m equal-- or I'll say p just so it makes sense. p is equal to the percentage off. Now what can we do? Well, now we can say that the discount is equal to the percentage off. In these other examples, we were picking 30%. But we can say now it's p. It's the percentage off. It's p. That's the percentage off times the product in question, times the price, the non-discount price of the product in question. Well, that was x. The discount is equal to p times x. Now, this is really interesting. Now we have a general way of calculating a discount for any given percentage off and any given product x. And we didn't have to use these words and these letters. We could have said let y equal the discount. Then we could have written the same underlying idea. Instead of writing discount, we could have written y is equal to the percentage off p times the non-discount price of the product, times x. And you could have defined these letters any way you wanted. Instead of writing y there, you could have written a Greek letter, or you could have written any symbol there. As long as you can keep track of it, that symbol represents the actual dollar discount. But now things get really interesting. Because we can use this type of a relationship, which is an equation-- you're equating y to this right over here, that's why we call it an equation-- this can be used for things that are completely unrelated to the price, the discount price, at the store over here. So in physics, you'll see that force is equal to mass times acceleration. The letters are different, but these are fundamentally the same idea. We could've let y is equal to force, and mass is equal to p. So let me write p is equal to mass. And this wouldn't be an intuitive way to define it, but I want to show you that this is the same idea, the same relationship, but it's being applied to two completely different things. And we could say x is equal to acceleration. Well, then the famous force is equal to mass times acceleration can be rewritten. And it's really the same exact idea as y, which we've defined as force, can be equal to mass, which we're going to use the symbol p, which is equal to p times acceleration. And we're just going to happen to use the letter x here, times x. Well, this is the exact same equation. This is the exact same equation. And we could see that we can take this equation, and it can apply to things in economics, or it can apply to things in fice, or it can apply to things in computer science, or logic, or electrical engineering, or anything, accounting. There's an infinite number of applications of this one equation. And what's neat about mathematics and what's neat about algebra in particular is we can focus on this abstraction. We can focus on the abstract here, and we can manipulate the abstract here. And what we discover from these ideas, from these manipulations, can then go and be reapplied to all of these other applications, to all of them. And even neater, it's kind of telling us the true structure of the universe if you were to strip away all of these human definitions and all of these human applications. So for example, we could say, look, if y is equal to p times x-- so literally, if someone said, hey, this is y, and someone says, on the other hand, I have p times x, I could say, well, you have the same thing in both of your hands. And if you were to divide one of them by a number, and if you wanted them to still be equal, you would divide the other one by that number. So for example, we know that y is equal to p times x. Well, what if you wanted to have them both be equal? And you say, well, what is y divided by x going to be equal to? Well, y was equal to p times x, so y divided by x is going to be the same thing as p times x divided by x. But now this is interesting. Because p times x divided by x-- well, if you multiply by something and then divide by that something, it's just you're going to get your original number. If you multiply by 5 and divide by 5, you're just going to start with p or whatever this number is. So those would cancel out. But we were able to manipulate the abstraction here and get y over x is equal to p-- and let me make that x green. And now this has implications for every one of these ideas. One is telling us a fundamental truth about the universe, almost devoid of any of these applications. But now we can go and take them back to any place that we applied. And the really interesting thing is we're going to find there are an infinite number of applications, and we don't even know, frankly, most of them. We're going to discover new ones for them in a thousand years. And so hopefully this gives you a sense for why Galileo said what he said about really mathematics is really the language with which we can understand the philosophy of the universe. And that's why people tell us that if a completely alien life form were to ever contact humans, mathematics would probably be our first common ground, 1the place that we can start to form a basis that we 1can start to communicate from.",math_algebra_foundation-algebra
" We already know that the derivative with respect to x of the natural log of x is equal to 1/x. But what about the derivative, not of the natural log of x, but some logarithm with a different base? So maybe you could write log base b of x where b is an arbitrary base. How do we evaluate this right over here? And the trick is to write this using the change of base formula. So we could write it in terms of logarithms. We know that log-- I'm just going to restate the change of base formula. And I'm going to change from log base b to log base e, which is essentially the natural log. So the change of base formula, we prove it elsewhere on the site. Feel free to search for it on the Khan Academy. The change of base formula tells us that log base b of x is equal to the natural log, if we want to go to log base e. The natural log of x over the natural-- actually let me write it as an explicit logarithm so it makes it clear what I'm doing. Log base e of x over log base e of b, which is the exact same thing as the natural log of x over the natural log of b. So all we have to do is rewrite this thing. This is equal to the derivative with respect to x of the natural log of x over the natural log of b. Or we could even write it as 1 over the natural log of b times the natural log of x. And now this becomes pretty straightforward. Because what we have right here, 1 over the natural log of b, this is just a constant that's multiplying the natural log of x. So we could take it out of the derivative. So this is the same thing as 1 over the natural log of b times the derivative with respect to x of the natural log of x. And we know what to do with this. This thing right over here is just going to be equal to 1/x. So we end up with 1 over the natural log of b times 1/x. So we end up with 1 over the natural log of b times 1/x, or 1 over the natural log of b, which is just a number times x. So if someone asks you what is the derivative with respect to x of log base 5 of x, well, now you know. It's going to be 1 over the natural log of 5 times x, just like that.",math_calculus-all-old_taking-derivatives-calc

" In the last video, we saw the classification of elements into groups on the periodic table, and we stopped with the definition for a transition metal. There are two ways to think about transition metals. So one way to think about it would be when some teachers say transition metal, they're talking about elements found from Groups 3 through Group 12. So all the elements in here, some people consider these to be the transition metals. So these are the elements found in the d block, right? So we're talking about d orbitals here. So you have to understand electron configurations for this video. So that's one way to think about the transition metals, but that way is maybe a little bit too general sometimes. So there is another definition, which you'll find in the IUPAC website. IUPAC is an acronym for International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, and they say that a transition element refers to an element whose atom has an incomplete d subshell. So when you're talking about the d orbitals, we already know there are five d orbitals, and each orbital holds a maximum of two electrons. So 5 times 2 is 10. So 10 will be the maximum number of electrons that you could fit in your d orbitals, or your d subshells. So let's count that out on our periodic table so 10, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 for our d block. So let's go ahead and write an electron configuration for a transition metal and let's see how that applies to our definition from IUPAC. So let's write an electron configuration for iron. So here's iron right here. And if I wanted to write an electron configuration, let's say I wanted to do noble gas notation. So once again, I'm assuming that you know how to do this already so I won't spend too much time talking about it. But if I want to write a noble gas configuration, I would go to argon, which is the noble gas before iron, and I would put argon in brackets like that. And that takes me to the fourth energy level or the fourth period on the periodic table. And then just looking at the periodic table, I can say, oh, that would be 4s1, 4s2, so I can write 4s2 here. And then I'm in my d orbitals. So, again, just looking at the periodic table to write my electron configuration, I would say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 electrons. So that would be 3d6. And I could have written this 3d6 4s2. And right now, both are considered to be correct answers. And I won't get into a discussion about the order of filling of these orbitals in this videos. So I'll save that for another video. This video is only talking about definitions and identifying elements on the periodic table. And so either one of these would be a correct electron configuration. And when I look at the d orbitals for the electron configuration, I can see that there are six electrons in my d orbitals. Well, that's an incomplete d subshell, because I can fit a total of 10 into my d orbitals. And so iron would be an example of an element whose atom has an incomplete d subshell. So iron is a transition metal. Let's write the electron configuration for zinc. So let's find zinc over here, so right there on pour periodic table. So if I wanted to write the electron configuration for zinc, once again, I would go to the noble gas before it, which is argon. So I would put in brackets argon right here. And then, once again, it takes me to the fourth energy level. So 4s1, 4s2, so 4s2. And then I count over for my d electrons-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. So it would be 3d10. And once again, I could have written that argon in brackets 3d10 4s2. So it doesn't matter. So let's think about the definition for a transition metal, an element whose atom has an incomplete d subshell. Well, if I look at the d orbitals for zinc, they are completely full. I have 10 electrons in my d orbital, and so this is a complete d subshell. So this does not meet the definition for a transition element. Now, also in the definition, it talks about cations. So let's think about to the cation that zinc would form. Zinc would go to zinc 2 plus. So if I wanted to write the electron configuration for zinc 2 plus, I need to think about where does zinc lose two electrons? So if you've going from a neutral atom of zinc to zinc 2 plus, you would have to lose two electrons. Well, I already know that those two electrons are going to be lost from the 4s orbitals. So we're going to lose these two electrons right here on your electron configuration, and so you'd be left with 3d10. And once again, you have a cation that has a complete d subshell. You've completely filled your d orbitals, and so the cation does not have an incomplete d subshell, which means that it doesn't fit our technical definition for a transition element from IUPAC. And so, once again, there are two ways of thinking about it. One's a very general way. So you might hear someone talk about an element from Groups 3 through to 12 as being a transition metal, or you might find people who are a little bit more particular about the definition, who go along with IUPAC. It's good to be aware of both ways of thinking about it.",science_chemistry_periodic-table
" - Scarlett and Hansol's teacher gave them a system of linear equations to solve. They each took a few steps that lead to the systems shown in the table below. So this is the teacher system. This is what Scarlett got after taking some steps. This is what Hansol got. Which of them obtained a system that is equivalent to the teacher's system? And just to remind ourselves, an equivalent system is a system that has, or at least for our purposes, is a system that has the same solution, or the same solution set. So if there is a certain xy that satisfies this system in order for Scarlett's system to be equivalent it needs to have the same solution. So let's look at this. So Scarlett, let's see, let's see if we can match these up. So her second equation here, so this is interesting, her second equation 14x - 7y = 2 over here the teacher has an equation 14x - 7y = 7. So this is interesting because the ratio between x and y is the same, but then your constant term, the constant term is going to be different. And I would make the claim that this alone tells you that Scarlett's system is not equivalent to the teacher. And you're saying, well, how can I say that? Well, these two equations if you were to write them into slope intercept form, you would see because the ratio between x and y, the x and y terms is the same. You're going to have the same slope, but you're going to have different Y intercepts. In fact, we can actually solve for that. So this equation right over here we can write it as if we, let's see, if we subtract 14x from both sides you get -7y - 14, woops, -7y =, is equal to -14x + 7 and we could divide both sides by -7. You get y = 2x -1 so that's this... All I did is algebraically manipulate this. This is this line and I could even try to graph it so let's do that. So I'll draw a quick coordinate. This is just going to be very rough. Quick coordinate axis right over there, and then this line, this line would look something like this. So its y intercept is -1 and it has a slope of 2. So let me draw a line with a slope of, a line with a slope of 2 might look something like that. So that's this line right over here or this one right over there, and let's see. This one over here is going to be, if we do the same algebra, we're going to have - 7y = -14x + 2, or y = , I'm just dividing everything by -7, 2x - 2/7 so this is going to look something like this. Its y intercept is -2/7 so it's like right over there. So this line is going to look something like, I'm going to draw my best, my best attempt at drawing it, it's going to look something... Actually that's not quite right. It's going to look something like... I'll actually just start it right over here. It's going to look something like, something like this. It's going to have the same slope, and obviously it goes in this direction as well. Actually, let me just draw that. So it's going to have the same slope, but at different y intercepts. That doesn't look right, but you get the idea. These two lines are parallel. So these two lines are parallel so any coordinate that satisfies this one is not going to satisfy this one. They have no points in common. They are parallel. That's the definition of parallel. Since this and this have no points in common, there's no way that some solution set that satisfies this would satisfy this 'cause any xy that satisfies this can't satisfy this or vice versa. They're parallel. There are no points. These two things will never intersect. So Scarlett does not have an equivalent system. Now what about Hansol? Well, we see Hansol has the same thing going on here. 5x - y, 5x - y, but then the constant term is different, -6, positive 3. So this and this also represent parallel lines. Any xy pair that satisfies this, there's no way that it's going to satisfy this. These two lines don't intersect. They are parallel. So Hansol's system is not equivalent either.",math_math1_systems
" We know how to take derivatives of functions. If I apply the derivative operator to x squared, I get 2x. Now, if I also apply the derivative operator to x squared plus 1, I also get 2x. If I apply the derivative operator to x squared plus pi, I also get 2x. The derivative of x squared is 2x. Derivative, with respect to x of pi of a constant, is just 0. Derivative, with respect to x of 1, is just a constant, is just 0. So once again, this is just going to be equal to 2x. In general, the derivative, with respect to x of x squared plus any constant, is going to be equal to 2x. The derivative of x squared, with respect to x, is 2x. Derivative of a constant, with respect to x, a constant does not change with respect to x, so it's just equal to 0. So you have-- You apply the derivative operator to any of these expressions and you get 2x. Now, let's go the other way around. Let's think about the antiderivative. And one way to think about it is we're doing the opposite of the derivative operator. The derivative operator, you get an expression and you find it's derivative. Now, what we want to do, is given some expression, we want to find what it could be the derivative of. So if someone were to tell-- or give you 2x-- if someone were to say 2x-- let me write this. So if someone were to ask you what is 2x the derivative of? They're essentially asking you for the antiderivative. And so you could say, well, 2x is the derivative of x squared. But you could also say 2x is the derivative of x squared plus 1. You could also say that 2x is the derivative of x squared plus pi, I think you get the general idea. So if you wanted to write it in the most general sense, you would write that 2x is the derivative of x squared plus some constant. So this is what you would consider the antiderivative of 2x. Now, that's all nice, but this is kind of clumsy to have to write a sentence like this, so let's come up with some notation for the antiderivative. And the convention here is to use kind of a strange looking notation, is to use a big elongated s looking thing like that, and a dx around the function that you're trying to take the antiderivative of. So in this case, it would look something like this. This is just saying this is equal to the antiderivative of 2x, and the antiderivative of 2x, we have already seen, is x squared plus c. Now, you might be saying, why do we use this type of crazy notation. It'll become more obvious when we study the definite integral and areas under curves and taking sums of rectangles in order to approximate the area of the curve. Here, it really should just be viewed as a notation for antiderivative. And this notation right over here, this whole expression, is called the indefinite integral of 2x, which is another way of just saying the antiderivative of 2x.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-antiderivatives-ftc
" Let's try to fill in our Laplace transform table a little bit more. And a good place to start is just to write our definition of the Laplace transform. The Laplace transform of some function f of t is equal to the integral from 0 to infinity, of e to the minus st, times our function, f of t dt. That's our definition. The very first one we solved for-- we could even do it on the side right here-- was the Laplace transform of 1. You know, we could almost view that as t to the 0, and that was equal to the integral from 0 to infinity. f of t was just 1, so it's e to the minus st, dt, which is equal to the antiderivative of e to the minus st, which is minus 1 over s, e to the minus st. And then you have to evaluate that from 0 to infinity. When you take the limit as this term approaches infinity, this e to the minus, this becomes e to the minus infinity, if we assume s is greater than 0. So if we assume s is greater than 0, this whole term goes to 0. So you end up with a 0 minus this thing evaluated at 0. So when you evaluate t is equal to 0, this term right here becomes 1, e to the 0 becomes 1, so it's minus minus 1/s, which is the same thing as plus 1/s. the? Laplace transform of 1, of just the constant function 1, is 1/s. We already solved that. Now, let's increment it a little bit. Let's see if we can figure out the Laplace transform of t. So we can view this as t to the 0. Now this is t to the 1. This is going to be equal to the integral from 0 to infinity, of e to the minus st times t dt. Now. I can tell you right now that I don't have the antiderivative of this memorized. I don't know what it is. But there's a sense that the integration by parts could be useful, because integration by parts kind of decomposes into a simpler problem. And I always forget integration by parts, so I'll rederive it here in this purple color. So if we have u times v, if we take the derivative with respect to t of that, that's equal to the derivative of the first times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. It's just the product rule. Now, if we take the integral of both sides of this equation, we get uv is equal to the antiderivative of u prime v plus the antiderivative of uv prime. Now, since we want to apply this to an integral, maybe let's make this what we want to solve for, so we can get the integral of uv prime is equal to-- we can just subtract this from that side of the equation, so it's equal-- I'm just swapping the sides, so I'm just solving for this, and to solve for this, I just subtract this from that, so it's equal to uv minus the integral of u prime v. So there you go. Even though I have trouble memorizing this formula, it's not too hard to rederive as long as you remember the product rule right there. So if we're going to do integration by parts, it's good to define our v prime to be something that's easy to take the antiderivative of, because we're going to have to figure out v later on, and it's good to take u to be something that's easy take the derivative of. So let's make t is equal to our u and let's make e to the minus st as being our v prime. If that's the case, then what is v? Well, v's just the antiderivative of that. In fact, we've done it before. It's minus 1/s, e to the minus st. That's v. And then if we want to figure out u prime, because we're going to have to figure out that later anyway, u prime's just the derivative of t. That's just equal to 1. So let's apply this. Let's see, so the Laplace transform of t is equal to uv. u is t, v is this right here. It's times minus 1/s, e to the minus st. e to the minus st, that's the uv term right there. And this is a definite integral, right? So we're going to evaluate this term right here from 0 to infinity. And then it's minus the integral from 0 to infinity of u prime, which is just 1 times v. v, we just figured out here, is minus-- let me write it in v's color-- times minus 1/s-- this is my v right here-- minus 1/s, e to the minus st, dt. All of that is dt. So let's see if we can simplify this. So this is equal to minus t/s, e to the minus st, evaluated from 0 to infinity. And let's see, we could take-- well, this is just 1. 1 times anything is 1. We can just not write that. And then bring the minus 1/s out. So if we bring the minus 1/s out, this becomes plus 1/s times the integral from 0 to infinity of e to the minus st, dt. And this should look familiar to you. This is exactly what we solved for right here. It was the Laplace transform of 1. So let's keep that in mind. So this right here is the Laplace transform of 1. And I want to write it that way, because we're going to see a pattern of this in the next video. I'm going to write that as a Laplace transform of 1. But what is this equal to? So we're going to evaluate this as it adds to infinity and then subtract from that evaluated at 0. You can kind of view it as a substitution, so this is equal to-- well, let me write it this way. It's the limit as A approaches infinity, of minus A/s, e to the minus sA. So that's this evaluated at infinity. And then from that, we're going to subtract this evaluated at 0. So minus all of this, but we already have a minus sign here, so we could write a plus. Plus 0/s times e to the minus s times 0. And then, of course, we have this term right here. So let me write that term. I'll do it in yellow or let me do it in blue. Plus 1/s-- that's this right there-- times the Laplace transform of 1. And what do we get? So what's the limit of this as A approaches infinity? You might say, wow, you know, as A approaches infinity right here, this becomes a really big number. There's a minus sign in there, so it would be a really big negative number. But this is an exponent. A is an exponent right here. So e to the minus infinity is going to go to zero much faster than this is going to go to infinity. This term right here is a much stronger function, I guess is the way you could see it. And you could try it out on your calculator, if you don't believe me. This term is going to overpower this term and so this whole thing is going to go to zero. Likewise, e to the minus-- e to the 0, this is 1, but you're multiplying it times a zero, so this is also going to go to zero, which is convenient because all of this stuff just disappears. And we're left with the Laplace transform of t is equal to 1/s times the Laplace transform of 1. And we know what the Laplace transform of 1 is. The Laplace transform of 1-- we just did it at beginning of the video-- was equal to 1/s, if we assume that s is greater than zero. In fact, we have to assume that s was greater than zero here in order to assume that this goes to zero. Only if s is greater than zero, when you get a minus infinity here does this approach zero. So fair enough. So the Laplace transform of t is equal to 1/s times 1/s, which is equal to 1/s squared, where s is greater than zero. So we have one more entry in our table, and then we can use this. What we're going to do in the next video is build up to the Laplace transform of t to any arbitrary exponent. And we'll do this in the next video.",math_differential-equations_laplace-transform
" We already know that attention is a limited resource, and we can't focus on everything in our environment at once. But how do we filter out the unimportant information, and how do we decide when to shift our attention to something new? You've probably experienced that even when you're in a loud crowded room, you're pretty good at attending to the one person who's talking to you. But you still hear bits and pieces of conversations that you're not trying to attend to. What those bits and pieces are and aren't are what interest psychologists who study selective attention, or your ability to focus on something that's relevant to the task at hand while ignoring other information. One way to study selective attention is to observe people while they're doing something called a shadowing task. In this task, you're wearing a pair of headphones, but different information is coming in through each ear piece. So through the left ear, you're hearing one thing, and through the right ear, you're hearing something completely different, maybe a different person's voice, maybe a different language, even. And you're told to repeat everything that's said into one ear, say, your right ear, so you have to pay attention to it and to ignore the other. Based on what we learn about the type of unattended information that we actually do and don't end up comprehending, we can then learn more about how selective attention works. And there are three major theories that try to explain this process. I'm going to talk about these theories in terms of auditory attention, but the same idea applies to other senses as well. The first is Broadbent's early selection theory. Broadbent's idea was that all the information in your environment goes into your sensory register, which briefly registers or stores all the sensory input you get. This includes words, clicks, sirens, any input at all. Then this input gets transferred to the selective filter right away, which identifies what it's supposed to be attending to via basic physical characteristics. So if we're talking about language, the selective filter identifies the voice, pitch, speed, accent, basic things like that, that you don't really need to understand in order to identify. Everything else gets filtered out, and the selected information gets moved along so that perceptual processes can occur. These processes assign meaning to the information. So while the selective filter identifies the pitch of the one you want to pay attention to, the perceptual processes identify it as your friend's voice and assign meaning to the words. Then you can engage in other cognitive processes, such as deciding how to respond. Broadbent's theory was a good start, but there are some problems. If you completely filter out the unattended information before it gets assigned meaning, then you shouldn't be able to identify your own name when it's spoken in an unattended ear. But as you've probably experienced, you immediately perk up when you hear your own name, even when it's across the room and you haven't been paying attention to that conversation before. This is known as the cocktail party effect, and this, among other things, led to researchers coming up with a new theory. A couple folks named Deutsch & Deutsch proposed a late selection theory, which moved Broadbent's selective filter to after the perceptual processes. This means that you actually do register and assign everything meaning, but then your selective filter decides what to pass on to your conscious awareness. That sounds pretty good, but keep in mind that all this has to happen really quickly. Given the limited resource of attention, and the fact that we know our brains are super-efficient, it seems a little wasteful to spend all that effort assigning meaning to stuff you won't ever need. So the answer may be somewhere in between early selection and late selection. So we come to Treisman's attenuation theory of selective attention. Treisman said that instead of a complete filter, we have something called an attenuator. Attenuate just means to weaken. So the attenuator weakens but doesn't eliminate the input from the unattended ear. Then some of it gets through to the perceptual processes. So we still assign meaning to stuff in the unattended ear. It's just not as high priority. At this point, if you realize that the unattended stuff is actually important, then you'll switch over your attention and attenuate what you were previously listening to. Later experiments suggested that the difficulty of the task you're attending to can affect when filtering occurs and how long it takes. The bottom line is there's still some debate about which theory is the absolute best. But these three theories have been pivotal in our understanding of selective attention. It's important to consider because attention is crucial to any other cognitive function we perform. If infants weren't able to attend a human voices and filter out birds chirping or dogs barking, it'd be nearly impossible to learn to speak. And if we didn't have some way to refocus on to unattended information, then we'd never notice if a car was coming straight for us or if someone yelled fire. So now, hopefully, you have a little better understanding of the theories that try to explain this important process.",science_health-and-medicine_executive-systems-of-the-brain
" Is 3 comma negative 4 a solution to the equation 5x plus 2y is equal to 7? So there's two ways to think about it. One, you could just substitute this x and y value into this equation to see if it satisfies-- and then we'll do that way first-- and the other way is if you had a graph of this equation, you could see if this point sits on that graph, which would also mean that it is a solution to this equation. So let's do it the first way. So we have 5x plus 2y is equal to 7, so let's substitute. Instead of x, let us put in 3 for x. So 5 times 3 plus 2 times y-- so y is negative 4-- plus 2 times negative 4 needs to be equal to 7. I'll put a question mark here, because we're not sure yet if it does. So 5 times 3 is 15, and then 2 times negative 4 is negative 8. So the left hand side, it simplifies to 15 minus 8, and this needs to be equal to 7. And of course, 15 minus 8 does equal 7, so this all works out. This is a solution, so we've answered the question. But I also want to show you, this way we just did it by substitution. If we had the graph of this equation, we could also do it graphically. So let's give ourselves the graph of this equation, and I'll do that by setting up a table. There's multiple ways to graph this. You could put it in a slope-intercept form and all of the rest, but I'll just set up a table of x and y values. And I'll graph it, and then given the graph, I want to see if this actually sits on it. And obviously it will, because we've already shown that this works. In fact, we could try the point 3, negative 4, and that actually is on the graph. We could do it on our table, but I won't do that just yet. I'm just going to do this to give ourselves a graph. So let's try it when x is equal to 0. We have 5 times 0 plus 2 times y is equal to 7. So when x is equal to 0, y is going to be-- so you're going to have 0 plus 2y is equal to 7. y is going to be equal to 3.5. When x is equal to 1, you have 5 plus 2y is equal to 7. If you subtract 5 from both sides, you get 2y is equal to 2. You get y is equal to 1. So when x is 1, y is 1, and when x is-- well let's try-- well that's actually enough for us to graph. We could keep doing more points. We could even put the point 3, negative 4 there, but let's just try to graph it in this very rough sense right here. So let me draw my x-axis, and then this right over here is my y-axis. And let me draw some points here. So let's say that this is y is 1, 2, 3, 4. This is negative 1, negative 2, negative 3, negative 4. I could keep going down in that direction. This is 1. Let me do it a little bit-- 1, 2, 3, 4, and I could just keep going on and on in the positive x direction. So let's plot these points. I have 0, 3.5. When x is 0, y is 1, 2, 3.5. When x is 1, y is 1. And so if we were to draw this line-- I'll do it as a dotted line, just so that I can make sure I connect the dots. I can do a better job than that though. So it will look something like that. And so if someone gave you this line, you'd say oh, well it's 3, negative 4 on this line, and let's assume that we drew it really nicely and this was all to scale. Let me try one last attempt at it. So it's going to look something like that. And If someone asked is 3, negative 4 on it, you could visually do it, but it's always hard when you actually don't substitute it, because you don't know. Maybe you're a little bit off. But if you look at it over here, you say when x is equal to 3, what is y? Well, you go down here, and it looks like y is equal to negative 4. So this is a point 3 comma negative 4. Obviously, in general, you don't want to just rely off of inspecting graphs. Maybe this was 3, negative 3.9999, and you just couldn't tell looking at the graph. That's why you always want to just the substitute and make sure that it really does equal, that this equality really does hold true at that point, not just looking at the graph. But it's important to realize that the graph really is another representation to all of the solutions of this equation.",math_algebra-home_alg-linear-eq-func
" I think we have a respectable sense of how muscles contract on the molecular level. Let's take a step back now and just understand how muscles look, at least structurally, or how they relate to things that we normally associate with muscles. So let me draw a flexing bicep right here. That's their elbow and let's say that's their hand right there. So this is their bicep and it's flexing. I think we've all seen diagrams of what muscles look, at least on kind of a macro level and it's connected to the bones at either end. Let me draw the bones. I'm not going to detail where-- so it's connected to the bones at either end by tendons. So this right here would be some bone. Right there would be another bone that it's connected to. And then this is tendons, which connects the bones to the muscles. We have the general sense-- connected to two bones, when it contracts it moves some part of our skeletal system. So we're actually focused on skeletal muscles. The other types are smooth muscles and cardiac muscles. Cardiac muscles are those, as you can imagine, in our heart. And smooth muscles are-- these are more involuntary, slow moving muscles and things like our digestive tract. And I'll do video on that in the future, but most of the time when people say muscles, we associate them with skeletal muscles that move our skeletal system around, allow us to run and lift and talk and do and bite things. So this is what we normally associate-- let's dig in a little bit deeper here. So if I were to take a cross section of this bicep right there-- if I were to take a cross section of that muscle right there-- so let me do it big. And then it looks something like this. This is the inside of this muscle over here. Now I said back here, we had our tendon. And then there's actually a covering; there's no strict demarcation or dividing line between the tendon and the covering around this muscle, but that covering is called the epimysium and it's really just connective tissue that covers the muscle, kind of protects it, reduces friction between the muscle and the surrounding bone and other tissue that might be in this person's arm right there. And then within this muscle, you have connective tissue on the inside. Let me do it in another color. I'll do it in orange. This is called a perimyseum, and that's also just connective tissue inside of the actual muscle. And then each of these things that the perimysium is dividing off-- let me say if we were to take one of these things and allow it to go a little bit further-- so if we were to take this thing right here-- what this perimysium is dividing off-- and if we were to pull it out-- actually, let me do this one right here. If we were to pull this one out just like that-- so you have the perimysium surrounding it, right? This is all perimysium, and it's just a fancy word for connective tissue. There's other stuff in there. You could have nerves and you could have capillaries, all sorts of stuff because you have to get blood and neuronal signals to your muscles of entry so it's not just connective tissue. It's other things that have to be able to eventually get to your muscle cells. So each of these-- I guess you'd call it subfibers, but these are pretty big subfibers of the muscle. This is called a fascicle. The connective tissue inside of the fascicle is called the endomysium. So once again, more connective tissues, has capillaries in it, has nerves in it, all of the things that have to eventually come in contact with muscle cells. We're inside of a single muscle. All this green connective tissue is endomysium. And each of these things that are in the endomysium are an actual muscle cell. This is an actual muscle cell. I'll do it in purple. So this thing right here-- I can pull it out a little bit. If I pull this out, this is an actual muscle cell. This is what we wanted to get to, but we're going to go even within the muscle cell to see, understand how all the myosin and the actin filaments fit into that muscle cell. So this right here is a muscle cell or a myofiber. The two prefixes you'll see a lot when dealing with muscles-- you're going to see myo, which you can imagine refers to muscle. And you're also going to see the word sarco, like sarcolemma, or sarcoplasmic reticulum. So you're also go see the prefix sarco and that's flesh-- so sarcophagus-- or you can think of other things that start with sarco. So sarco is flesh. Muscle is flesh and myo is muscle. So this is myofiber. This is an actual muscle cell and so let's zoom in on the actual muscle. So let me actually draw it really a lot bigger here. So an actual muscle cell is called a myofiber. It's called a fiber because it's longer than it is wide and they come in various-- let me draw the myofiber like this. I'll take a cross section of the muscle cell as well. And these can be relatively short-- several hundred micrometers-- or it could be quite long-- at least quite long by cellular standards. We're talking several centimeters. Think of it as a cell. That's quite a long cell. Because it's so long, it actually has to have multiple nucleuses. Actually, to draw the nucleuses, let me do a better job drawing the myofiber. I'm going to make little lumps in the outside membranes where the nucleuses can fit on this myofiber. Remember, this is just one of these individual muscle cells and they're really long so they have multiple nucleuses. Let me take its cross section because we're going to go inside of this muscle cell. So I said it's multinucleated. So if we kind of imagine its membrane being transparent, there'd be one nucleus over here, another nucleus over here, another nucleus over here, another nucleus over there. And the reason why it's multinucleated is so that over large distances, you don't have to wait for proteins to get all the way from this nucleus all the way over to this part of the muscle cell. You can actually have the DNA information close to where it needs to be. So it's multinucleated. I read one-- I think it was 30 or so nucleuses per millimeter of muscle tissue is what the average is. I don't know if that's actually the case, but the nucleuses are kind of right under the membrane of the muscle cell-- and you remember what that's called from the last video. The membrane of the muscle cell is the sarcolemma. These are the nucleuses. And then if you take the cross section of that, there are tubes within that called myofibrils. So here there's a bunch of tubes inside of the actual cell. Let me pull one of them out. So I've pulled out one of these tubes. This is a myofibril. And if you were to look at this under a light microscope, you'll see it has little striations on it. the striations will look something like that, like that, like that, and there'll be little thin ones like that, like that. And inside of these myofibrils is where we'll find our myosin and actin filaments. So let's zoom in over here on this myofibril. We'll just keep zooming until we get to the molecular level. So this myofibril, which is-- remember, it's inside of the muscle cell, inside of the myofiber. The myofiber is a muscle cell. Myofibral is a-- you can view it as a tube inside of the muscle cell. These are the things that are actually doing the contraction. So if I were to zoom in on a myofibril, you're going to see it-- it's going to look something like that and it's going to have those bands in it. So the bands are going to look something like this. 1You're going to have these short bands like that. 1Then you're going to have wider bands like that, like 1these little dark-- trying my best to draw them relatively 1neatly and there could be a little line right there. 1Then the same thing repeats over here. 1So each of these units of 1repetition is called a sarcomere. 1And these units of repetition go from one-- this is called a 1Z-line to another Z-line. 1And all of this terminology comes out of when people just 1looked under a microscope and they saw these lines, they 1started attaching names to it. 1And just so you have the other terminology-- we'll talk about 1how this relates to the myosin and the actin in a second. 1This right here is the A-band. 1And then this distance right here or these parts right 1here, these are called the I-bands. 1And we'll talk about really in a few seconds how that relates 1to the mechanisms or the units that we talked-- or the 1molecules that we talked about in the last video. 1So if you were to zoom in here, if you were to go into 1these myofibrils, if you were to take a cross section of 1these myofibrils, what you'll find is-- if you were to cut 1it up, maybe slice it-- if you were slice it parallel to the 1actual screen that you're looking at, you're going to 1see something like this. 1So this is going to be your Z-band. 1This is your next Z-band. 1So I'm zooming in on sarcomere now. 1This is another Z-band. 1Then you have your actin filaments. 1Now we're getting to that molecular level 1that I talked about. 1And then in between the actin filaments, you have your 1myosin filaments. 1Remember, the myosin filaments had those two heads on them. 1They each have two heads like that, that crawl along the 1actin filaments. 1I'm just drawing a couple of them and then they're attached 1at the middle just like that. 1We'll talk about in a second what happens when the muscle 1actually contracts. 1And I could draw it again over here. 1So it has many more heads than what I'm drawing, but this 1just gives you an idea of what's happening. 1These are the myosin, I guess, proteins and they all 1intertwined like we saw in the previous video and then 1there'll be another one over here. 1I don't have to draw in detail. 1So you can see immediately that the A-band corresponds to 1where we have our myosin. 1So this is our A-band right here. 1And there is an overlap. 1They do overlap each other, even in the resting state, but 1the I-band is where you only have actin 1filaments, no myosin. 1And then the myosin filaments are held in place by titin, 1which you can kind of imagine as a springy protein. 1I want to do it in a different color than that. 1So the myosin is held in place by titin. 1It's attached to the Z-band by titin. 1So what happened? 1So we have all of these-- when a neuron excites-- so let me 1draw an endpoint of a neuron right here, the endpoint of an 1axon of a neuron right there. 1It's a motor neuron. 1It's telling this guy to contract. 1You have the action potential. 1The action potential travels along the membrane, really in 1all directions. 1And then it eventually, if we look at it from this view, 1they have those little transverse or T-tubules. 1They essentially go into the cell and continue to propagate 1the action potential. 1Those trigger the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium. 1The calcium attaches to the troponin that's attached to 1these actin filaments that moves the tropomyosin out of 1the way, and then the crawling can occur. 1The myosin can start using ATP to crawl 1along these actin filaments. 1And so as you can imagine, as they crawl along, their power 1stroke is going to push-- you can either view it as the 1actin filaments in that way or you can say that the myosin is 1going to want to move in that direction, but you're pulling 1on both sides of a rope, right? 1So the myosin is going to stay in one place and the actin 1filaments are going to be pulled together. 1And that's essentially how the muscle is contracting. 1So we've, hopefully, in this video, connected the big 1picture from the flexing muscle all the way over here 1to exactly what's happening at the molecular level that we 1learned in the last few videos. 1And you can imagine, when this happens to all of the 1myofibrils inside of the muscle, right, because the 1sarcoplasmic reticulum's releasing calcium generally 1into the cytoplasm of-- which is also called myoplasm, 1because we're dealing with muscle cells-- the cytoplasm 1of this muscle cell. 1The calcium floods all of these myofibrils. 1It's able to attach to all of the troponin-- or at least a 1lot of the troponin on top of these actin filaments and then 1the whole muscle contracts. 1And then when that's done, each muscle fiber, myofiber, 1or each muscle cell will not have that 1much contracting power. 1But when you couple it with all of them that are around 1it-- if you just have one, actually, working, or a few of 1them, you'll just have a twitch. 1But if you have all of them contracting together, then 1that's actually going to create the force to actually 1do some work, or actually pull your bones together, or lift 1some weights. 1So hopefully you found that mildly useful.",science_biology_human-biology
"  We've talked a lot about demand. So now let's talk about supply, and we'll use grapes as this example. We'll pretend to be grape farmers of some sort. So I will start by introducing you-- and maybe I'll do it in purple in honor of the grapes-- to the law of supply, which like the law of demand, makes a lot of intuitive sense. If we hold all else equal-- in the next few videos, we'll talk about what happens when we change some of those things that we're going to hold equal right now-- but if you hold all else equal and the only thing that you're doing is you're changing price, then the law of supply says that if the price goes up-- I'll just say p for price-- if the price goes up, then the supply-- now, let me be careful-- the quantity supplied goes up. And then you can imagine, if the price goes down, the quantity supplied goes down. And you might already notice that I was careful to say quantity supplied. And it's just like we saw with demand. When we talk about demand going up or down, we're talking about the entire price-quantity relationship shifting. When we talk about a particular quantity demanded, we say quantity demanded. We don't just say demand. This is the exact same thing for supply. When we're talking about a particular quantity, we'll be careful to say quantity. If we talk about supply increasing, we're talking about the entire relationship shifting either up or down. So let's just make sure that this makes intuitive sense for us. And I think it probably does. Let's think about ourselves as grape farmers. And I'll make a little supply schedule right over here. So Grape Supply Schedule, which is really just a table showing the relationship between, all else equal, the price and the quantity supplied. So let's label some scenarios over here, just like we did with the demand schedule. Scenarios. And then let's put our Price over here. This will be in price per pound, the per pound price of grapes. And then this is the quantity produced over the time period. And whenever we do any of these supply or demand schedules, we're talking over a particular time period. It could be per day, it could be per month, it could be per year. But that's the only way to make some sense of, OK, what is the quantity per day going to be produced if that's the price? So if we didn't say per day, we don't know what we're really talking about. Quantity Supplied.  And so let's just say Scenario A, if the price per pound of grapes is $0.50-- if it's $0.50 per pound-- actually, let me just do round numbers, but you get the idea. If the price per pound is $1, let's just say for us, we consider that to be a relatively low price. And so we'll only kind of do the easiest land, our most fertile land, where it's easy to produce grapes. And maybe the fertile-- and cheap land. So no one else wants to use that land for other things. It's only good for growing grapes. And so we will provide-- so this is price per pound.  And in that situation, we can produce 1,000 pounds in this year. And I've never been a grape farmer, so I actually don't know if that's a reasonable amount or not, but I'll just go with it, 1,000 pounds. Now, let's take Scenario B. Let's say the price goes up to $2. Well now, not only would we produce what we were producing before, but we might now want to maybe buy some more land, land that might have had other uses, land that's maybe not as productive for grapes. But we would, because now we can get more for grapes. And so maybe now we are willing to produce 2,000 pounds. And we can keep going. The same dynamics keep happening. So let's say the price-- if the price were $3 per pound, now we do want to produce more. Maybe we're even willing to work a little harder or plant things closer to each other, or maybe I'll get even more land involved than I would have otherwise used for other crops. And so then I'm going to produce 2,500 pounds. And I'll do one more scenario. Let's say Scenario D, the price goes to $4 a pound. Same dynamic, I will stop planting other crops, use them now for grapes, because grape prices are so high. And so I will produce 2,750 pounds. And so we can draw a supply curve just like we have drawn demand curves. And it's the same exact convention, which I'm not a fan of, putting price on the vertical axis. Because as you see, we tend to talk about price as the independent variable. We don't always talk about it that way. And in most of math and science, you put the independent variable on the horizontal axis. But the convention in economics is to put it on the vertical axis. So price on the vertical axis. So then this is really Price per pound.  And then in the horizontal axis, Quantity Produced, or-- let me just write it. Quantity Produced, I'll say in the next year. We're assuming all of this is for the next year, so next year. And it's in thousands of pounds, so I'll put it in thousands of pounds. And so let's see, we go all the way from 1,000 to close to 3,000. So let's say this is 1,000, that's 1 for 1,000, that's 2,000, and that is 3,000. And then the price goes all the way up to 4. So it's 1, 2, 3, and then 4. So we can just plot these points. These are specific points on the supply curve. So at $1, we would supply 1,000 pounds, at $1, 1,000 pounds. That's Scenario A. At $2, we would supply 2,000 pounds, $2, we'd supply 2,000 pounds. That's scenario B. At $3, we'd supply 2,500 pounds, $3-- oh, sorry. Now, when we look up-- See, now notice, I get my axes confused. This is Price. This isn't, when we talk about it this way, that we're viewing the thing that's changing. Although, you don't always have to do it that way. So at one $1, 1,000 pounds. $1, 1,000 pounds. $2, 2,000 pounds. $2, 2,000 pounds. $3-- this isn't $3, this is $3. $3, 2,500 pounds. So right about there. That's about 2,500. But I want to do it in that blue color, so we don't get confused. So $3, 2,500 pounds. That's about right. So this is Scenario C. And then Scenario D, at $4-- actually, let me be a little bit clearer with that, because we're getting close. So this is 2,500 pounds, gets us right over here. This is Scenario C. And then Scenario D at $4, 2,750. So 2,750 is like right over there. So that is $4. That is Scenario D. And if we connect them, they should all be on our supply curve. So they will all be-- it will look something like that. And there's some minimum price we would need to supply some grapes at all. We wouldn't give them away for free. So maybe that's something-- that minimum price is over here, that just even gets started producing grapes. So this right over here is what our supply curve would look like. Now remember, the only thing we're varying here is the price. So if the price were to change, all else equal, we would move along this curve here. Now, in the next few videos, I'll talk about all those other things we've been holding equal and what they would do at any given price point to this curve or, in general, what they would do to the curve.

" -  What we're going to do in this video is calculate a typical measure of how well the actual data points agree with a model, in this case, a linear model and there's several names for it. We could consider this to be the standard deviation of the residuals and that's essentially what we're going to calculate. You could also call it the root-mean-square error and you'll see why it's called this because this really describes how we calculate it. So, what we're going to do is look at the residuals for each of these points and then we're going to find the standard deviation of them. So, just as a bit of review, the ith residual is going to be equal to the ith Y value for a given X minus the predicted Y value for a given X. Now, when I say Y hat right over here, this just says what would the linear regression predict for a given X? And this is the actual Y for a given X. So, for example, and we've done this in other videos, this is all review, the residual here when X is equal to one, we have Y is equal to one but what was predicted by the model is 2.5 times one minus two which is .5. So, one minus .5, so this residual here, this residual is equal to one minus 0.5 which is equal to 0.5 and it's a positive 0.5 and if the actual point is above the model you're going to have a positive residual. Now, the residual over here you also have the actual point being higher than the model, so this is also going to be a positive residual and once again, when X is equal to three, the actual Y is six, the predicted Y is 2.5 times three, which is 7.5 minus two which is 5.5. So, you have six minus 5.5, so here I'll write residual is equal to six minus 5.5 which is equal to 0.5. So, once again you have a positive residual. Now, for this point that sits right on the model, the actual is the predicted, when X is two, the actual is three and what was predicted by the model is three, so the residual here is equal to the actual is three and the predicted is three, so it's equal to zero and then last but not least, you have this data point where the residual is going to be the actual, when X is equal to two is two, minus the predicted. Well, when X is equal to two, you have 2.5 times two, which is equal to five minus two is equal to three. So, two minus three is equal to negative one. And so, when your actual is below your regression line, you're going to have a negative residual, so this is going to be negative one right over there. Now we can calculate the standard deviation of the residuals. We're going to take this first residual which is 0.5, and we're going to square it, we're going to add it to the second residual right over here, I'll use this blue or this teal color, that's zero, gonna square that. Then we have this third residual which is negative one, so plus negative one squared and then finally, we have that fourth residual which is 0.5 squared, 0.5 squared, so once again, we took each of the residuals, which you could view as the distance between the points and what the model would predict, we are squaring them, when you take a typical standard deviation, you're taking the distance between a point and the mean. Here we're taking the distance between a point and what the model would have predicted but we're squaring each of those residuals and adding them all up together, and just like we do with the sample standard deviation, we are now going to divide by one less than the number of residuals we just squared and added, so we have four residuals, we're going to divide by four minus one which is equal to of course three. You could view this part as a mean of the squared errors and now we're gonna take the square root of it. So, let's see, this is going to be equal to square root of this is 0.25, 0.25, this is just zero, this is going to be positive one, and then this 0.5 squared is going to be 0.25, 0.25, all of that over three. Now, this numerator is going to be 1.5 over three, so this is going to be equal to, 1.5 is exactly half of three, so we could say this is equal to the square root of one half, this one over the square root of two, one divided by the square root of two which gets us to, so if we round to the nearest thousandths, it's roughly 0.707. So, approximately 0.707. And if you wanted to visualize that, one standard deviation of the residuals below the line would look like this, and one standard deviation above the line for any given X value would go one standard deviation of the residuals above it, it would look something like that. And this is obviously just a hand-drawn approximation but you do see that this does seem to be roughly indicative of the typical residual. Now, it's worth noting, sometimes people will say it's the average residual and it depends how you think about the word average because we are squaring the residuals, so outliers, things that are really far from the line, when you square it are going to have disproportionate impact here. If you didn't want to have that behavior we could have done something like find the mean of the absolute residuals, that actually in some ways would have been the simple one but this is a standard way of people trying to figure out how much a model disagrees with the actual data, and so you can imagine the lower this number is the better the fit of the model.",math_statistics-probability_describing-relationships-quantitative-data
" PROFESSOR: Welcome back. I'm going to show you the last two logarithm properties now. So this one-- and I always found this one to be in some ways the most obvious one. But don't feel bad if it's not obvious. Maybe it'll take a little bit of introspection. And I encourage you to really experiment with all these logarithm properties, because that's the only way that you'll really learn them. And the point of math isn't just to pass the next exam, or to get an A on the next exam. The point of math is to understand math so you can actually apply it in life later on and not have to relearn everything every time. So the next logarithm property is, if I have A times the logarithm base B of C, if I have A times this whole thing, that that equals logarithm base B of C to the A power. Fascinating. So let's see if this works out. So let's say if I have 3 times logarithm base 2 of 8. So this property tells us that this is going to be the same thing as logarithm base 2 of 8 to the third power. And that's the same thing. Well, that's the same thing as-- we could figure it out. So let's see what this is. 3 times log base-- what's log base 2 of 8? The reason why I kind of hesitated a second ago is because every time I want to figure something out, I implicitly want to use log and exponential rules to do it. So I'm trying to avoid that. Anyway, going back. What is this? 2 to the what power is 8? 2 to the third power is 8, right? So that's 3. We have this 3 here, so 3 times 3. So this thing right here should equal 9. If this equals 9, then we know that this property works at least for this example. You don't know if it works for all examples, and for that maybe you'd want to look at the proof we have in the other videos. But that's kind of a more advanced topic. But the important thing first is just to understand how to use it. Let's see, what is 2 to the ninth power? Well it's going to be some large number. Actually, I know what it is-- it's 256. Because in the last video we figured out that 2 to the eighth was equal to 256. So 2 to the ninth should be 512. So 2 to the ninth should be 512. So if 8 to the third is also 512 then we are correct, right? Because log base 2 of 512 is going to be equal to 9. What's 8 to the third? It's 64-- right. 8 squared is 64, so 8 cubed-- let's see. 4 times 2 is 3. 6 times 8-- looks like it's 512. Correct. And there's other ways you could have done it. Because you could have said 8 to the third is the same thing as 2 to the ninth. How do we know that? Well, 8 to the third is equal to 2 to the third to the third, right? I just rewrote 8. And we know from our exponent rules that 2 to the third to the third is the same thing as 2 to the ninth. And actually it's this exponent property, where you can multiply-- when you take something to exponent and then take that to an exponent, and you can essentially just multiply the exponents-- that's the exponent property that actually leads to this logarithm property. But I'm not going to dwell on that too much in this presentation. There's a whole video on kind of proving it a little bit more formally. The next logarithm property I'm going to show you-- and then I'll review everything and maybe do some examples. This is probably the single most useful logarithm property if you are a calculator addict. And I'll show you why. So let's say I have log base B of A is equal to log base C of A divided by log base C of B. Now why is this a useful property if you are calculator addict? Well, let's say you go class, and there's a quiz. The teacher says, you can use your calculator, and using your calculator I want you to figure out the log base 17 of 357. And you will scramble and look for the log base 17 button on your calculator, and not find it. Because there is no log base 17 button on your calculator. You'll probably either have a log button or you'll have an ln button. And just so you know, the log button on your calculator is probably base 10. And your ln button on your calculator is going to be base e. For those you who aren't familiar with e, don't worry about it, but it's 2.71 something something. It's a number. It's nothing-- it's an amazing number, but we'll talk more about that in a future presentation. But so there's only two bases you have on your calculator. So if you want to figure out another base logarithm, you use this property. So if you're given this on an exam, you can very confidently say, oh, well that is just the same thing as-- you'd have to switch to your yellow color in order to act with confidence-- log base-- we could do either e or 10. We could say that's the same thing as log base 10 of 357 divided by log base 10 of 17. So you literally could just type in 357 in your calculator and press the log button and you're going to get bada bada bam. Then you can clear it, or if you know how to use the parentheses on your calculator, you could do that. But then you type 17 on your calculator, press the log button, go to bada bada bam. And then you just divide them, and you get your answer. So this is a super useful property for calculator addicts. And once again, I'm not going to go into a lot of depth. This one, to me it's the most useful, but it doesn't completely-- it does fall out of, obviously, the exponent properties. But it's hard for me to describe the intuition simply, so you probably want to watch the proof on it, if you don't believe why this happens. But anyway, with all of those aside, and this is probably the one you're going to be using the most in everyday life. I still use this in my job. Just so you know logarithms are useful. Let's do some examples. Let's just let's just rewrite a bunch of things in simpler forms. So if I wanted to rewrite the log base 2 of the square root of-- let me think of something. Of 32 divided by the cube-- no, I'll just take the square root. Divided by the square root of 8. How can I rewrite this so it's reasonably not messy? Well let's think about this. This is the same thing, this is equal to-- I don't know if I'll move vertically or horizontally. I'll move vertically. This is the same thing as the log base 2 of 32 over the square root of 8 to the 1/2 power, right? And we know from our logarithm properties, the third one we learned, that that is the same thing as 1/2 times the logarithm of 32 divided by the square root of 8, right? I just took the exponent and made that the coefficient on the entire thing. And we learned that in the beginning of this video. And now we have a little quotient here, right? Logarithm of 32 divided by logarithm of square root of 8. Well, we can use our other logarithm-- let's keep the 1/2 out. That's going to equal, parentheses, logarithm-- oh, I forgot my base. Logarithm base 2 of 32 minus, right? Because this is in a quotient. Minus the logarithm base 2 of the square root of 8. Right? Let's see. Well here once again we have a square root here, so we could say this is equal to 1/2 times log base 2 of 32. Minus this 8 to the 1/2, which is the same thing is 1/2 log base 2 of 8. We learned that property in the beginning of this presentation. And then if we want, we can distribute this original 1/2. This equals 1/2 log base 2 of 32 minus 1/4-- because we have to distribute that 1/2-- minus 1/4 log base 2 of 8. This is 5/2 minus, this is 3. 3 times 1/4 minus 3/4. Or 10/4 minus 3/4 is equal to 7/4. I probably made some arithmetic errors, but you get the point. 1See you soon!",math_engageny-alg2_alg2-3
" -  The table gives selected values of the continuous function f. All right, fair enough. Can we use the intermediate value theorem to say that the equation f of x equal is equal to zero has a solution where four is less than or equal to x is less than or equal to six? If so, write a justification. So, pause this video and see if you can think about this on your own before we do it together. Okay, well let's just visualize what's going on and visually think about the intermediate value theorem. So, if that's my y-axis there and then let's say that this is my x-axis right over here. We've been given some points over here. We know when x is equal to zero, f of x is equal to zero. Let me draw those. So, we have that point. When x is equal to two, y or f of x, y equals f of x is gonna be equal to a negative two. So, we have a negative two right over there. When x is equal to four, so, three, four, f of x is equal to three. One, two, three. I'm doing it on a slightly different scale so that I can show everything. And when x is equal to six, so, five, six, f of x is equal to seven. Three, four, five, six, seven. So, right over here. Now, they also tell us that our function is continuous. So, one intuitive way of thinking about continuity is I can connect all of these dots without lifting my pencil. So, the function might look, I'm just gonna make up some stuff, it might look something, anything like what I just drew just now. And it could have even wilder fluctuations but that is what my f looks like. Now, the intermediate value theorem says hey, pick a closed interval. And here, we're picking the closed interval from four to six, so let me look at that. So, this is one, two, three, four here, this is six here, so we're gonna look at this closed interval. And the intermediate value theorem tells us that look, if we're continuous over that closed interval, our function f is gonna take on every value between f of four, which in this case, so, this is f of four, is equal to three, and f of six, which is equal to seven. f of six, which is equal to seven. And so, if someone said hey, is there gonna be a solution to f of x is equal to, say, five over this interval? Yes. Over this interval, for some x, you're going to have f of x being equal to five. But they're not asking us for an f of x equaling something between these two values. They're asking us for an f of x equaling zero. Zero isn't between f of four and f of six, and so we cannot use the intermediate value theorem here. And so, if we wanted to write it out, we could say f is continuous but zero is not between f of four and f of six. So, the intermediate value theorem does not apply. All right, let's do the second one. So here they say, can we use the intermediate value theorem to say that there is a value c such that f of c equals zero and two is less than or equal to c is less than or equal to four? If so, write a justification. We are given that f is continuous, so let write that down. We are given that f is continuous, and if you wanna be over that interval, but they're telling us it's continuous in general. And then we can just look at what is the value of the function at these end points? Our interval goes from two to four, so we're talking about this closed interval right over here. We know that f of two is going to be equal to negative two. We see it on that table. And what's f of four? f of four is equal to three. So, zero is between f of two and f of four. And you can see it visually here. There's no way to draw between this point and that point without picking up your pen, without crossing the x-axis, without having to point where your function is equal to zero. And so, we can say according to the intermediate value theorem, there is a value c such that f of c is equal to zero and two is less than or equal to c is less than or equal to four. So, all we're saying is hey, there must be a value c, and the way I drew it here, that c value is right over where c is between two and four, where f of c is equal to zero. And this seems all mathy and a little bit confusing sometimes but it's saying something very intuitive. If I had to go from this point to that point without picking up my pen, I am going to at least cross every value between f of two and f of four at least once.",math_calculus-1_cs1-limits-and-continuity
"  What I want to do in this video is prove to you that the square root of 2 is irrational. And I'm going to do this through a proof by contradiction. And the proof by contradiction is set up by assuming the opposite. So this is our goal, but for the sake of our proof, let's assume the opposite. Let's assume that square root of 2 is rational. And then we'll see if we lead to a contradiction, that this actually cannot be the case. And if it cannot be the case that is rational, if we get to a contradiction by assuming the square root of 2 is rational, then we have to deduce that the square root of 2 must be irrational. So let's assume the opposite. Square root of 2 is rational. Well, if the square root of 2 is rational, that means that we can write the square root of 2 as the ratio of two integers, a and b. And we can also assume that these have no factors in common. Let's say that they did have some factors in common. If we divided the numerator and the denominator by those same factors, then you're getting into a situation where they have no factors in common. Or another way of saying is that a and b are co-prime. Or another way of saying it is we could write this as a ratio of two integers where this is irreducible, where these no longer share any factors. If you can write anything as the ratio of two integers, then you could obviously simplify it further, factor out any common factors to get it to a point where it is irreducible. So I'm going to assume that my a and b, that this fraction right over here, is irreducible. And this is important for setting up our contradiction. So I'm going to assume that this right over here is irreducible.  a and b have no factors in common. Let me write that down because that's so important for this proof. a and-- want to do that same color-- a and b have no factors in common, other than, I guess, 1.  So this is irreducible. These two numbers are co-prime. So what does that do for us? Well, let's just try to manipulate this a little bit. Let's square both sides of this equation. So if you square the principal root of 2, you're going to get 2. And that's going to be equal to a squared over b squared.  And that just comes from a over b squared is the same thing as a squared over b squared. And now we can multiply both sides of this by b squared. And so we get 2 times b squared is equal to a squared. Now, what does this tell us about a squared? Well, a squared is some number, b squared times 2. So anything times 2 is going-- this is going to be an integer. We assumed b is an integer, so b squared must be an integer, and so you have an integer times 2. Well, that must give you an even number. That must give you an even integer. So this right over here, a squared, must be-- so this tells us that a squared must be even. Now, why is that interesting? Well, a squared is the product of two numbers or is the product of the same number. It's a times a. So this is another way of saying that a times a is even. So what does that tell us about a? Let's just remind ourselves. a is either going to be-- we're assuming a is an integer-- a is either going to be even or odd. We just have to remind ourselves if we multiply an even times an even, we get an even number. If we multiply an odd times an odd, we get an odd number. So we have a number times itself. We got an even number. Well, the only way to get that is if that number is even. So this tells us that a is even. And another way of saying that a is even is to say that a can be represented as the product of 2 times some integer. So let's say some integer k. So where is all of this going? Well, as you'll see, we can then use this to show that b must also be even. So let's think about that a little bit. So let's go back to this step right over here. If we say that a can be represented as two times the product of some integer, and that comes out of the fact that a is even. Then we can rewrite this expression right over here as 2-- I'll do it over here-- 2 times b squared is equal to 2k squared. Instead of a squared, I could write 2k squared. We're claiming, or we're deducing, that, assuming everything we've just assumed, that a is even. So if a is even, it can be represented as a product of 2 and some integer. And then we can write that 2 times b squared is equal to 4k squared.  And then you divide both sides by 2. You get b squared is equal to 2k squared.  And this tells us that, well, k squared is going to be an integer. You take any integer times 2 you're going to get an even value. So this tells us that b squared is even.  So that tells us that b squared is even. Well, if b squared is even, by the same logic we just used, that tells us that b is even.  So here's our contradiction. We assumed, in the beginning, that a and b have no common factors other than 1. We assumed that this fraction right over here, a/b, is irreducible. But from that and the fact that a/b must be equal to the square root of 2, we were able to deduce that a is even and b is even. Well, if a is even and b is even, and they both have 2 as a factor, and then this isn't irreducible. You could divide the numerator and the denominator by 2. a and b have a common factor of 2. So let me write this down. So this is just to make it clear. So from this and this, we have a and b have common factor of 2, which means that a over b is reducible. And so that's the contradiction.  So you assume that square root of 2 can be represented as an irreducible fraction a/b, irreducible because you can say ratio of two integers right over here, that leads you to the contradiction that, no, it actually can be reducible. So, therefore, you cannot make this assumption. It leads to a contradiction. Square root of 2 must be irrational. ",math_algebra-home_alg-intro-to-algebra
" In this video, I want to familiarize you with the idea of a limit, which is a super important idea. It's really the idea that all of calculus is based upon. But despite being so super important, it's actually a really, really, really, really, really, really simple idea. So let me draw a function here, actually, let me define a function here, a kind of a simple function. So let's define f of x, let's say that f of x is going to be x minus 1 over x minus 1. And you might say, hey, Sal look, I have the same thing in the numerator and denominator. If I have something divided by itself, that would just be equal to 1. Can't I just simplify this to f of x equals 1? And I would say, well, you're almost true, the difference between f of x equals 1 and this thing right over here, is that this thing can never equal-- this thing is undefined when x is equal to 1. Because if you set, let me define it. Let me write it over here, if you have f of, sorry not f of 0, if you have f of 1, what happens. In the numerator, we get 1 minus 1, which is, let me just write it down, in the numerator, you get 0. And in the denominator, you get 1 minus 1, which is also 0. And so anything divided by 0, including 0 divided by 0, this is undefined. So you can make the simplification. You can say that this is you the same thing as f of x is equal to 1, but you would have to add the constraint that x cannot be equal to 1. Now this and this are equivalent, both of these are going to be equal to 1 for all other X's other than one, but at x equals 1, it becomes undefined. This is undefined and this one's undefined. So how would I graph this function. So let me graph it. So that, is my y is equal to f of x axis, y is equal to f of x axis, and then this over here is my x-axis. And then let's say this is the point x is equal to 1. This over here would be x is equal to negative 1. This is y is equal to 1, right up there I could do negative 1. but that matter much relative to this function right over here. And let me graph it. So it's essentially for any x other than 1 f of x is going to be equal to 1. So it's going to be, look like this. It's going to look like this, except at 1. At 1 f of x is undefined. So I'm going to put a little bit of a gap right over here, the circle to signify that this function is not defined. We don't know what this function equals at 1. We never defined it. This definition of the function doesn't tell us what to do with 1. It's literally undefined, literally undefined when x is equal to 1. So this is the function right over here. And so once again, if someone were to ask you what is f of 1, you go, and let's say that even though this was a function definition, you'd go, OK x is equal to 1, oh wait there's a gap in my function over here. It is undefined. So let me write it again. It's kind of redundant, but I'll rewrite it f of 1 is undefined. But what if I were to ask you, what is the function approaching as x equals 1. And now this is starting to touch on the idea of a limit. So as x gets closer and closer to 1. So as we get closer and closer x is to 1, what is the function approaching. Well, this entire time, the function, what's a getting closer and closer to. On the left hand side, no matter how close you get to 1, as long as you're not at 1, you're actually at f of x is equal to 1. Over here from the right hand side, you get the same thing. So you could say, and we'll get more and more familiar with this idea as we do more examples, that the limit as x and L-I-M, short for limit, as x approaches 1 of f of x is equal to, as we get closer, we can get unbelievably, we can get infinitely close to 1, as long as we're not at 1. And our function is going to be equal to 1, it's getting closer and closer and closer to 1. It's actually at 1 the entire time. So in this case, we could say the limit as x approaches 1 of f of x is 1. So once again, it has very fancy notation, but it's just saying, look what is a function approaching as x gets closer and closer to 1. Let me do another example where we're dealing with a curve, just so that you have the general idea. So let's say that I have the function f of x, let me just for the sake of variety, let me call it g of x. Let's say that we have g of x is equal to, I could define it this way, we could define it as x squared, when x does not equal, I don't know when x does not equal 2. And let's say that when x equals 2 it is equal to 1. So once again, a kind of an interesting function that, as you'll see, is not fully continuous, it has a discontinuity. Let me graph it. So this is my y equals f of x axis, this is my x-axis right over here. Let me draw x equals 2, x, let's say this is x equals 1, this is x equals 2, this is negative 1, this is negative 2. And then let me draw, so everywhere except x equals 2, it's equal to x squared. So let me draw it like this. So it's going to be a parabola, looks something like this, let me draw a better version of the parabola. So it'll look something like this. Not the most beautifully drawn parabola in the history of drawing parabolas, but I think it'll give you the idea. I think you know what a parabola looks like, hopefully. It should be symmetric, let me redraw it because that's kind of ugly. And that's looking better. OK, all right, there you go. All right, now, this would be the graph of just x squared. But this can't be. It's not x squared when x is equal to 2. So once again, when x is equal to 2, we should have a little bit of a discontinuity here. So I'll draw a gap right over there, because when x equals 2 the function is equal to 1. When x is equal to 2, so let's say that, and I'm not doing them on the same scale, but let's say that. So this, on the graph of f of x is equal to x squared, this would be 4, this would be 2, this would be 1, this would be 3. So when x is equal to 2, our function is equal to 1. So this is a bit of a bizarre function, but we can define it this way. You can define a function however you like to define it. And so notice, it's just like the graph of f of x is equal to x squared, except when you get to 2, it has this gap, because you don't use the f of x is equal to x squared when x is equal to 2. You use f of x-- or I should say g of x-- you use g of x is equal to 1. Have I been saying f of x? I apologize for that. You use g of x is equal to 1. So then then at 2, just at 2, just exactly at 2, it drops down to 1. And then it keeps going along the function g of x is equal to, or I should say, along the function x squared. So my question to you. So there's a couple of things, if I were to just evaluate the function g of 2. Well, you'd look at this definition, OK, when x equals 2, I use this situation right over here. And it tells me, it's going to be equal to 1. Let me ask a more interesting question. Or perhaps a more interesting question. What is the limit as x approaches 2 of g of x. Once again, fancy notation, but it's asking something pretty, pretty, pretty simple. It's saying as x gets closer and closer to 2, as you get closer and closer, and this isn't a rigorous definition, we'll do that in future videos. As x gets closer and closer to 2, what is g of x approaching? So if you get to 1.9, and then 1.999, and then 1.999999, and then 1.9999999, what is g of x approaching. Or if you were to go from the positive direction. If you were to say 2.1, what's g of 2.1, what's g of 2.01, what's g of 2.001, what is that approaching as we get closer and closer to it. And you can see it visually just by drawing the graph. As g gets closer and closer to 2, and if we were to follow along the graph, we see that we are approaching 4. Even though that's not where the function is, the function drops down to 1. The limit of g of x as x approaches 2 is equal to 4. And you could even do this numerically using a calculator, and let me do that, because I think that will be interesting. So let me get the calculator out, let me get my trusty TI-85 out. So here is my calculator, and you could numerically say, OK, what's it going to approach as you approach x equals 2. So let's try 1.94, for x is equal to 1.9, you would use this top clause right over here. So you'd have 1.9 squared. 1And so you get 3.61, well what if you get even closer to 2, 1so 1.99, and once again, let me square that. 1Well now I'm at 3.96. 1What if I do 1.999, and I square that? 1I'm going to have 3.996. 1Notice I'm going closer, and closer, 1and closer to our point. 1And if I did, if I got really close, 11.9999999999 squared, what am I going to get to. 1It's not actually going to be exactly 4, 1this calculator just rounded things up, 1but going to get to a number really, really, really, really, 1really, really, really, really, really close to 4. 1And we can do something from the positive direction too. 1And it actually has to be the same number 1when we approach from the below what we're trying to approach, 1and above what we're trying to approach. 1So if we try to 2.1 squared, we get 4.4. 1If we do 2. 1let me go a couple of steps ahead, 12.01, so this is much closer to 2 now, squared. 1Now we are getting much closer to 4. 1So the closer we get to 2, the closer 1it seems like we're getting to 4. 1So once again, that's a numeric way 1of saying that the limit, as x approaches 2 1from either direction of g of x, even though right at 2, 1the function is equal to 1, because it's discontinuous. 1The limit as we're approaching 2, 1we're getting closer, and closer, and closer to 4.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-limits-continuity
" I'm going to start with a fair coin, and I'm going to flip it four times. And the first question I want to ask is, what is the probability that I get exactly one head, or heads? This is one of those confusing things, when you're talking about what side of the coin. I know I've been not doing this consistently. I'm tempted to say, if you're saying one, it feels like you should do the singular, which would be head. But I've read up a little bit of it on the internet, and it seems like when you're talking about coins, you really should say one heads, which is a little bit, it seems a little bit difficult for me. But I'll try to go with that. So what is the probability of getting exactly one heads? And I put that in quotes to say, you know, really, we're just to talking about one head there. But it's called heads when you're dealing with coins. Anyway, I think you get what I'm talking about. And to think about this, let's think about how many different possible ways we can get four flips of a coin. So we're going to have one flip, then another flip, then another flip, then another flip. And this first flip has two possibilities. It could be heads or tails. The second flip has two possibilities. It could be heads or tails. The third flip has two possibilities. It could be heads or tails. And the fourth flip has two possibilities. It could be heads or tails. So you have 2 times 2 times 2 times 2, which is equal to 16 possibilities. 16 possible outcomes when you flip a coin four times. And any one of the possible outcomes would be 1 of 16. So if I wanted to say, so if I were to just say the probability, and I'm just going to not talk about this one heads, if I just take a, just maybe this thing that has three heads right here. This exact sequence of events. This is the first flip, second flip, third flip, fourth flip. Getting exactly this, this is exactly one out of a possible of 16 events. Now with that out of the way, let's think about how many possibilities, how many of those 16 possibilities, involve getting exactly one heads? Well, we could list them. You could get your heads. So this is equal to the probability of getting the heads in the first flip, plus the probability of getting the heads in the second flip, plus the probability of getting the heads in the third flip. Remember, exactly one heads. We're not saying at least one, exactly one heads. So the probability in the third flip, and then, or the possibility that you get heads in the fourth flip. Tails, heads, and tails. And we know already what the probability of each of these things are. There are 16 possible events, and each of these are one of those 16 possible events. So this is going to be 1 over 16, 1 over 16, 1 over 16, and 1 over 16. And so we're really saying the probability of getting exactly one heads is the same thing as the probability of getting heads in the first flip, or the probability of getting heads-- or I should say the probability of getting heads in the first flip, or heads in the second flip, or heads in the third flip, or heads in the fourth flip. And we can add the probabilities of these different things, because they are mutually exclusive. Any two of these things cannot happen at the same time. You have to pick one of these scenarios. And so we can add the probabilities. 1/16 plus 1/16 plus 1/16 plus 1/16. Did I say that four times? Well, assume that I did. And so you would get 4/16, which is equal to 1/4. Fair enough. Now let's ask a slightly more interesting question. Let's ask ourselves the probability of getting exactly two heads. And there's a couple of ways we can think about it. One is just in the traditional way. [? We ?] know the number of possibilities and of those equally likely possibilities. And we can only use this methodology because it's a fair coin. So, how many of the total possibilities have two heads of the total of equally likely possibilities? So we know there are 16 equally likely possibilities. How many of those have two heads? So I've actually, ahead of time so we save time, I've drawn all of the 16 equally likely possibilities. And how many of these involve two heads? Well, let's see. This one over here has two heads, this one over here has two heads, this one over here has two heads. Let's see, this one over here has two heads, and this one over here has two heads. And then this one over here has two heads, and I believe we are done after that. So if we count them, one, two, three, four, five, six of the possibilities have exactly two heads. So six of the 16 equally likely possibilities have two heads. So we have a-- what is this-- a 3/8 chance of getting exactly two heads. Now that's kind of what we've been doing in the past, but what I want to do is think about a way so we wouldn't have to write out all the possibilities. And the reason why that's useful is, we're only dealing with four flips now. But if we were dealing with 10 flips, there's no way that we could write out all the possibilities like this. So we really want a different way of thinking about it. And the different way of thinking about it is, if we're saying exactly two heads, you can imagine we're having the four flips. Flip one, flip two, flip three, flip four. So these are the flips, or you could say, the outcome of the flips. And if you're going to have exactly two heads, you could say, well, look, I'm going to have one head in one of these positions, and then one head in the other position. So how many, if I'm picking the first, so I have kind of a heads one, and I have a heads two. And I don't want you to think that these are somehow the heads in the first flip or the heads in the second flip. What I'm saying is we need two heads. We need a total of two heads in all of our flips. And I'm just giving one of the heads a name, and I'm giving the other head a name. And what we're going to see in a few seconds is that we actually don't want to double count, we don't want to count the situation, we don't want to double count this situation-- heads one, heads two, tails, tails. And heads two, heads one, tails, tails. For our purposes, these are the exact same outcomes. So we don't want to double count that. And we're going to have to account for that. But if we just think about it generally, how many different spots, how many different flips can that first head show up in? Well, there's four different flips that that first head could show up in. So there's four possibilities, four flips, or four places that it could show up in. Well, if that first head takes up one of these four places, let's just say that first head shows up on the third flip, then how many different places can that second head show up in? Well, if that first head is in one of the four places, then that second head can only be in three different places. So that second head can only be-- I'm picking a nice color here-- can only be in three different places. And so, you know, it could be in any one of these. It could maybe be right over there. Any one of those three places. And so, when you think about it in terms of the first, and I don't want to say the first head, head one. Actually, let me call it this way. Let me call it head A and head B. That way you won't think that I'm talking about the first flip or the second flip. So this is head A, and this right over there is head B. So if you had a particular, I mean, these heads are identical. These outcomes aren't different, but the way we talk about it right now, it looks like there's four places that we could get this head in, and there's three places where we could get this head in. And so if you were to multiply all of the different ways that you could get, all of the different scenarios where this is in four different places, and then this is in one of the three left over places, you get 12 different scenarios. But there would only be 12 different scenarios if you viewed this as being different than this. And let me rewrite it with our new-- So this is head A, this is head B, this is head B, this is head A. There would only be 12 different scenarios if you viewed these two things as fundamentally different. But we don't. We're actually double counting. Because we can always swap these two heads and have the exact same outcome. So what you want to do is actually divide it by two. So you want to divide it by all of the different ways that you can swap two different things. If we had three heads here, you would think about all of the different ways you could swap three different things. If you had four heads here, it would be all the different ways you could swap four different things. So there's 12 different scenarios if you couldn't swap them, but you want to divide it by all of the different ways that you can swap two things. So 12 divided by 2 is equal to 6. Six different scenarios, fundamentally different scenarios, considering that you can swap them. If you assume that head A and head B can be interchangeable. But it's a completely identical outcome for us, because they're really just heads. So there's six different scenarios, and we know that there's a total of 16 equally likely scenarios. So we could say that the probability of getting exactly two heads is 6 times, six scenarios and-- Or there's a couple of ways. You could say there are six scenarios that give us two heads, of a possible 16. Or you could say there are six possible scenarios, and the probability of each of those scenarios is 1/16. But either way, you'll get the same answer.",math_precalculus_prob-comb
" In this video, we're going to explore how we can start with acetic acid. And acetic acid looks like this. And end up with acetyl chloride that looks like this. And it's going to be done in the presence of thionyl chloride. And thionyl chloride, we haven't seen it before, but it just looks like this. It's a sulfur double bonded to an oxygen. And then, it has single bonds to two separate chlorines. And then, if you want to care, sulphur has six valence electrons. So it has another lone pair right over here. And we'll focus on this. Because this is really the simplest reaction of starting with a carboxylic acid and forming a acyl halide. And it can be generalized very easily. If you turn this methyl group into just a larger chain, and then this will be a larger chain right here. And, instead of having a chlorine here, you could do it with other halides as well. So let's think about how this might occur. So let's have our acetic acid right over here. And then, you have this oxygen bonded to a hydrogen. Now, this guy has got two lone pairs. And then the thionyl chloride-- I'll redraw the thionyl chloride right over here. And I'll set it up in the right position. The thionyl chloride looks like this. And this has a lone pair of electrons right over here. And all of these molecules, chlorine, and oxygen-- or all of these atoms-- chlorine and oxygen-- we can look at a periodic table up here. You see sulphur over here. And then, to the right of sulphur is chlorine. And above sulphur is oxygen. So both chlorine and oxygen are more electronegative than sulfur. So sulphur is going to have a partial positive charge there, even though sulphur is a reasonably electronegative atom in its own right. But these other guys are going to be sucking electronic away from it. So you could imagine this entire molecule could act as a nucleophile, with this oxygen, right over here, giving an electron to the sulphur. Sulphur is an electronegative atom, but it has a partial positive charge in just this thionyl cholride. So it will be attracted there. And then this guy is going to have to give up an electron. And he'll give it back to this oxygen up there. And so that will be-- and this reaction could go in either direction. So, once again, I'll draw it in equilibrium. But right after that happens, we'll have this, I guess we could call it a complex, that will look like this. This oxygen, it had two lone pairs. It had one pair, two pairs. And now, it has a third pair, because it got this electron. It always had that other electron in the covalent bond. And now, it has a negative charge. And now, the sulphur is bonded to those two chlorines. And then, it is also bonded to this oxygen over here. So let me draw it over here. So we have this oxygen, which is bonded to this carbonyl carbon, just like that. And then, it is bonded to a hydrogen right over there. It has one lone pair now. And the other lone pair is, now, turned into a covalent bond with the sulfur. And so this guy gave away an electron. So he now has a positive charge. Now, the next step, you could imagine that this oxygen says, hey, I liked having a double bond with the sulfur. The sulfur is still bonded to a bunch of things that are more electronegative to it. It still has a slightly positive charge there. So you could imagine that this electron gets given back to the sulfur. But then, the sulfur needs to bump an electron. Chlorine is pretty electronegative, so one of these chlorines will be able to take away an electron. So this chlorine could take away an electron. So then, after that happens, our situation-- and once again, this is in equilibrium-- our situation will look like this. Let me draw. So let me draw the original acetic acid. Or the part that was part of the original acetic acid. And so you have this oxygen, right over here, bonded to a hydrogen, bonded to-- let me do it in the same color so we can keep track of things-- bonded to this sulphur right over here, which now has a double bond, which, now again, has a double bond with this oxygen up here. So I'll do it in that same color. It's still bonded to that chlorine up there. But now, this chlorine is left. It has taken that electron with it. So the chlorine had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 valence electrons. It gained this electron, this orange electron. So now, it has a negative charge. And, by the way, this guy never lost his positive charge. Still has a positive charge like that. Now, the chlorine could act as a nucleophile on the carbonyl carbon. This guy is bonded to two oxygens, more elctronegative, partially positive charge. This guy can give an electron to the carbonyl carbon. And right as that happens, this is a nucleophilc attack, the carbonyl carbon can give up an electron to the carbonyl oxygen. And then, we will be in equilibrium. So make sure you realize we're going to the right then down. Now, we're going to the left with this thing. So this was the carbonyl carbon bonded to this oxygen right now, which now, just took another electron. So now, it has a negative charge. It had 1, 2 lone pairs. And now, it will have one more lone pair because it took that electron. It always had this end of that bond. So now it has both of these electrons over here. It has a negative charge. It gained an electron. And then, it is bonded it to this OH group right over here. And then that is bonded to the sulfur, which is bonded to the chlorine, and now double bonded to that other oxygen. Of course, we have this chlorine over here that did the nucleophilic attack. So you have this chlorine over here. And this nucleophilc attack, it gave an electron to what was this carbonyl carbon. It gave an electron. So it is now neutral. And you can kind of imagine that this negative charge got transferred to this oxygen up here. And this oxygen, right here, still has a positive charge. Don't want to forget that. Now, the next step that could happen-- once again, all these can go in either direction-- is that this guy doesn't like having a negative charge. And this guy is still going to have a partially positive charge, because he's bonded to a bunch of more electronegative atoms than itself. So he wants to reform the double bond. And that kicks off all of this business over here. So then this-- let me do this in a new color. I've already used the magenta. I'll use the pink. This electron, right here, gets taken back by this oxygen that had a positive charge anyway. So it would want to take it back. And then we are left with-- and we're getting pretty close to the punchline. We are, then, in equilibrium. This part over here will then look like this. We now have reformed our double bond. It is only going to be bonded to the chlorine, just like this. And this whole part over here on the right has broken off. So you have this oxygen bonded-- let me do it in the same colors. You have this oxygen bonded to a hydrogen. It now gained an electron. So it is now neutral. And it is bonded to this sulfur. The sulphur is in green. It's bonded to the sulfur, which is bonded to a chlorine. And then, it has a double bond to this oxygen right over here. So we've already formed our acetyl chloride. And we've really finished with the hard part of the reaction-- to see that how you could get an acetyl chloride. And then to kind of complete this reaction-- because if you actually perform this in a beaker, you'll end up with some hydrogen chloride and some sulfur oxide as a by-product. You could imagine that this oxygen, right over here, takes back its electron from this proton, gives it to this sulfur. And then, the sulfur, since it got an electron, will allow the electronegative chlorine to take back its electron. And then, if we just focus on this, the acetyl chloride, at this point, isn't doing anything anymore. This would be in equilibrium with something that looks like this. You now have a hydrogen proton floating around. 1Just a naked proton, really. 1There's not even any neutrons there. 1You have this oxygen, which is now double 1bonded with this sulfur. 1So I'm going to try to keep all of the colors the same. 1This, right here, was yellow. 1And then, that original bond it had with it was magenta. 1And then, you have the chlorine nabbed that electron. 1And it already had seven valence electrons. 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. it now has a negative charge. 1And then, the final step. 1So we already have our sulphur dioxide. 1Now, the final step is just the chlorine giving one of its 1electrons to the hydrogen to form hydrogen chloride. 1So then, the final step is just this. 1So when all is said and done, we end up 1with some acetyl chloride. 1We end up with some hydrogen chloride. 1And we end up with sulphur dioxide. 1Just like that, and we're done. 1And, once again, you can generalize this to get it 1starting with any carboxylic acid and forming the acyl 1halide version of it, or acyl chloride version, if you want 1to stick with a chloride right over here. 1Actually, this, right here, is acetyl chloride. 1Anyway, hopefully, you found that entertaining.",science_organic-chemistry_carboxylic-acids-derivatives
" -  We've already seen in an earlier video, that etiomers are stereoisomers that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other. Let's say we want to draw the etiomer of this compound on the left. One way to do it would be reflect this compound in the mirror and if you look at this carbon skeleton, here we have our carbon skeleton with our OH group coming out at us in space. That's this model on the left. There's our carbon skeleton with our OH coming out at us in space. If we reflect this compound in the mirror, we'll see the etiomer in the mirror. Our mirror image on the right is nonsuperimposable upon our model on the left. Let's just draw what we see, we see our carbon skeleton, like this, so let's draw that. So there is our carbon skeleton, and our OH group is coming out at us in space. So we could represent that with a wedge, let's fill in our wedge here. Now let's draw our OH, and so this drawing on the right, is the etiomer to the drawing on the left. There's another way to represent the etiomer on the right and to do that, let's check out the video. So, in the video I imagine an axis going through this carbon and then I rotate about this axis to give us another viewpoint of our other etiomer. So here's a model of our etiomer, and you can see our carbon skeleton with our OH coming out at us, attached to this carbon and then a hydrogen going away from us in space. If we imagine rotating about an axis, through this carbon. Let's go ahead and do that. We'll see another way to look at the etiomer. So now we have, for our carbon skeleton, you can see our carbon skeleton looks like this now, and then as this carbon has the OH going away from us in space, and the hydrogen coming out at us. So here we have some pictures from the video to help us with our drawings. We can see that this picture is this compound, if you look at that carbon skeleton and you can see the OH coming out at us in space. So in the video, we took this compound and we rotated it to give us this image on the right. So these are just two images of the same compound. And this gives us another way to draw our etiomer. This time our carbon skeleton's going like that. Let me go ahead and draw in our carbon skeleton, and our OH group is going away from us in space. So we have to put in the OH group with a dash, like that. So these two drawings, represent the same compound, the etiomer that we were trying to draw. There are two main ways to draw an etiomer, at least two ways that I like to use. The first way is to reflect the compound in a mirror> That's what we did first, we took this compound and we reflected it in the mirror and we drew what we saw and that gave us this drawing of the etiomer. We've seen that this drawing on the right, is the same thing as this drawing on the left here and notice the difference between this drawing and our original compound. The carbon skeletons are the same if you look at these two, the only difference is that we changed the wedge to a dash. So that's another very convenient way to draw an etiomer. If your starting with a wedge, change it to a dash. If your starting with a dash, change it to a wedge. Now let's draw the etiomer of this compound. The first method that we'll use is the mirror method. So here's a simplified representation of our compounds so ignoring things like confirmations of our ring. On this carbon, our Bromine is going down in space so that's this carbon, so you can see that Bromine's going down. And on this carbon Bromine's going up in space, that's this carbon with our Bromine going up. In the mirror we can see the mirror image or the etiomer. So let's go ahead and draw our etiomer here. So we draw our cyclohexane ring, and at this carbon, we have our Bromine going down in space, so let's go ahead and put our Bromine going down. Then at this carbon, we have our Bromine going up in space, so that's a wedge. We draw in our Bromine here, let me fill in this wedge, and let's put in the Bromine. So this on the right, is the etiomer. Sometimes you don't have model sets or a mirror, but you can draw the mirror image by just using this drawing on the left. Imagine a mirror right here, and just as you see up here, this Bromine is reflected in the mirror, this Bromine is reflected in the mirror, right. So these two, these Bromine's are reflecting each other. This carbon is opposite of this carbon, so that's this carbon and this one, and this carbon is opposite of this one, so this carbon is opposite of that one. Just a few tricks to help you draw the mirror image. There's another way to represent our etiomer on the right, and let's go to the video to see the other way. So here we have our two etiomer's, you can see they're mirror images of each other. If I rotate the etiomer on the right, you can see it from a different view point. Notice that both chiral center's have been inverted and just to prove that these are etiomer's of each other, let's try to superimpose one on top of the other. Notice how you can't do it. These are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other. This picture on the right in the video, shows you the relationship between our two etiomer's. So thinking about reflecting the molecule on the left in a mirror, we can see the etiomer on the right. But we took this molecule on the right, this etiomer and rotated it into this position. So now let's draw the etiomer from this perspective. We start out with our cyclohexane ring and you can see at this carbon our Bromine is going down in space so that must be a dash, so there's my Bromine. And then at this carbon, our Bromine is coming up in space, coming out at us, so that's a wedge. Let me go ahead and draw in our wedge, and we'll put in our Bromine. So this is just another way to represent our etiomer's on the right. So this drawing and this drawing are two different ways to represent the same molecule. So this is the etiomer to the compound on the left. Let's look at our original compound and compare this drawing on the right. Notice that this carbon your Bromine is coming out at you in space. Where as with this carbon your Bromine is going away from you in space. At this carbon your Bromine is going away from you in space, at this carbon your Bromine is coming out at you in space. So to draw our etiomer, we just invert all chirality center's. So if you have a wedge, change it to a dash. If you have a dash, change it to a wedge. So this way is often easier, so just make sure to invert all your chiral center's to draw the etiomer. For bicyclic compounds it's easiest to use the mirror method. So if our goal is to draw the etiomer of this compound, we can imagine a mirror right here. And we can use this picture above as a guide. You can see that the Hydrogen is reflected in the mirror, and the Chlorine is reflected in the mirror, let's go ahead and draw those in. So we draw our Hydrogen here and then our bond going down to this carbon and then the Chlorine going straight down from here. Notice how this Hydrogen is reflected and this Chlorine is reflected. Next let's think about reflecting this carbon, so we need to draw a line in this way right here. So now this carbon is reflected with that one. Let me highlight those carbons right here. I'm going to extend this line out a little bit so we can see where the horizontal is approximately, like that. So that's this carbon and this carbon, so that's carbon's reflected in our mirror. Next, let's draw a line up in space relative to that line like that so that takes us to this carbon which is reflecting this one in our mirror. Now let's worry about this one, so this should go up in space, let me draw a horizontal line down here just to help us with our drawing. So approximately horizontal at this point. We know we want to go up in space from this point, so let's do that, so that's this line. This carbon is reflecting this carbon. Next, let's go ahead and reflect our top carbon here. Let's draw this line over to here, so you can think about this top carbon reflecting that one. Let's draw our lines over here, so from here and then back down to here. It's more of a drawing exercise really, we're going to go down a little bit, we'll leave that line broken so we can see that one's going behind. And then we'll draw this to the carbon in the back and then we know what draw down from this line to the carbon in the back and then we can connect those line. Finally, we've drawn our etiomer. So on the right is the etiomer to the compound on the left. And just to prove that this on the right is the etiomer, let's look at a video where I tried to superimpose the mirror image on original compound. Here we have our two etiomer's, so mirror images of each other that are nonsuperimposable, just to prove they're nonsuperimposable, I'll rotate the etiomer on the right and try to superimpose it onto the one on the left. You can see that they don't match up. So these are etiomer's",science_organic-chemistry_stereochemistry-topic
" SAL KHAN: This is Sal here again. And I'm still here with my good friend Dr. Mahadevan from Stanford University. And in the last video, we had looked at adequacy of x-rays, for the neck, which is, is the x-ray good enough. But now let's assume we have good x-rays. Now, what do we look at? DR. MAHADEVAN: The next step is to look at the alignment. So we talk about the ABCs of reading a cervical spine film. And A starts with adequacy, that we went over. And the second part of A is alignment. SAL KHAN: OK. So we're still in A. So now it's alignment. I was expecting something with a B. All right, alignment. All right. So this looks like this is about alignment. DR. MAHADEVAN: This is about alignment. And there's four lines that we look at. The first is the anterior vertebral body line. SAL KHAN: OK, AVBL, right over there. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. And basically, what you're doing is, you're trying to draw a smooth line that connects the anterior aspect, the front of all the vertebral bodies. It should be nice and smooth. It's usually curved. And all the points should sort of fit on that line. Nothing should be off of that line. That would suggest that there was a problem there. SAL KHAN: I see. And anterior, as you just said, means front. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. SAL KHAN: Right, OK. DR. MAHADEVAN: The next line is going to the back of the vertebral body. It's the posterior vertebral body. SAL KHAN: So not the back of the entire vertebrae, the vertebral body, which is this boxy part right in front. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. And so same thing, connecting a line up and down should be nice and smooth, as you've drawn it. And nothing should fall off that line. No piece of that vertebral body should fall off of the line you've draw. SAL KHAN: All right, sounds good. And then? DR. MAHADEVAN: The next is, we connect all the spinolaminar junctions. So this is the spinolaminar line. And it's where the lamina connects to the spinous process. SAL KHAN: Spinous process, it sounds like we could make a whole video about that. DR. MAHADEVAN: Spinous process, if you look at the back of somebody's neck, are those little bumps that you can see. And that's the very back end. SAL KHAN: And that's these triangular things right here. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. SAL KHAN: OK. So you're just connecting that line. Kind of the front of these triangles, the base of these triangles, so to speak. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. SAL KHAN: And then the last one? DR. MAHADEVAN: And the last line is the spinous process tips. And again, we're just connecting the top, the tip of all these spinous processes, the little bony projections you can see if you look at the back of somebody's neck. And these two should generally fall in a nice, smooth curve. SAL KHAN: And so the general rule-- if any of these aren't aligned the way that we've drawn here, it's a problem. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly, exactly. We call it subluxation or malalignment or misalignment. And these all suggest that there is a problem there. SAL KHAN: Which is a big deal, because your spinal cord is running through there. DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely. If you look between the two, the green and the blue line, that's actually where your actual spinal cord runs. SAL KHAN: Right. Right down there. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. SAL KHAN: I see. So you don't want that to get messed up. All right. So let's look at a few of these x-rays and see if, one, anything's wrong. Or if there's something, if we can spot it. DR. MAHADEVAN: Actually, Sal, now that you know how to read cervical spine x-rays. I'm going to have you look at the first x-ray. SAL KHAN: OK, let's see. I'm going to get sued for malpractice. Let's see. All right. So this one over here. So let me just do the first one. Let me just go with what you told me to do. So I'm going to do the anterior side of this vertebral body. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. SAL KHAN: Look, I'm learning the words too, talking like a doctor. So I'm going to draw a line here. That looks pretty good. That looks decent. What is it? I'm kind of-- let me see. This still looks decent. And that doesn't look great. Would this count? I mean, this looks like it got shifted over a little bit. DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely. SAL KHAN: It's not a huge shifting. But it's enough that it's not easy to draw a line. So I was right? DR. MAHADEVAN: You're absolutely right. And in fact, sometimes it's very subtle. And you picked up a very subtle abnormality. But again, even though it's subtle on the x-ray, it could be serious for the patient. So you potentially saved their spinal cord and their lives, by picking up an injury like this. SAL KHAN: OK, good. You're making me feel-- very good. So that's-- it's literally something as subtle as that is what you're looking for. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. Again, it should be a nice, smooth line or a nice, smooth curve. And as you can see, at that junction, it's no longer smooth. SAL KHAN: And you don't even have to look at the other lines. Any one of these that you don't align, that's enough to say, hey, do something else. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. And that's a great, important teaching point, which is, if you see any abnormality on a plane film on an x-ray like this, you stop. And you protect their cervical spine. And then you get a more important study or a better quality study, like a CT scan. SAL KHAN: Fascinating. Although if I do look here, it does look like we could have done the PVBL. And it looks like that also is a little off too. DR. MAHADEVAN: Absolutely. SAL KHAN: That one and-- OK, well, let's get a few more. DR. MAHADEVAN: Great. SAL KHAN: I don't want to focus too much on my first victory. All right. So it's clear this person is facing this way. I can see their teeth. So let's see what we can do here. Can I give it a shot again? DR. MAHADEVAN: Please, please. SAL KHAN: So let's-- the AVBL, it looks pretty good. This is-- well, that looks close. DR. MAHADEVAN: It looks close, I agree. And potentially, again, you've got a very keen eye and might have picked it up. But most people might-- SAL KHAN: A gift, you might say. DR. MAHADEVAN: --might have overlooked that. SAL KHAN: So let's try the other lines here. OK. So this one is more obvious. This one is more obvious that there's kind of that disconnection right over there. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. And this is the PVBL, or the posterior vertebral body line. You can see clearly, that line is not smooth. It doesn't connect, and so there is a problem right there at that junction. SAL KHAN: OK. All right, and so now we have this last one right over here. Let me see what I can do. Let me see, don't want to lose my streak. All right. So interior side-- this actually looks pretty perfect actually. DR. MAHADEVAN: And in fact, it is a perfect. SAL KHAN: OK. Let me try the next lines here. This is the posterior vertebral body. Let me do that in a color that's easier to see. I already used orange. I'll do magenta. All right. So this is looking OK. It looks OK. I mean, nothing obvious on that line. DR. MAHADEVAN: I would say, again, you've got the keen eye. But in this particular case, I'd say, it's fine. It's within the normal range, as we say. SAL KHAN: And so let me do the base of those triangles. Let me do-- so this is a triangle right over here. DR. MAHADEVAN: Again, you want it to be a nice, smooth curve. Everything should fall on that curve. SAL KHAN: So this-- I would have to be a little bit generous with my curve to make it go to these guys down here. DR. MAHADEVAN: Exactly. And this is the spinal laminar line. This is the third line of alignment. As you can see, to try to get those to work, you could. But they're not smooth like the other lines. And this is, again, another subtle finding. But missing this finding because the first two lines are normal could again be devastating for the patient. SAL KHAN: Right. You always want to err on the side of caution. I mean, if anything looks even a little bit suspicious, maybe another x-ray. DR. MAHADEVAN: Yeah, another x-ray, another view, like we talked about before. Or the definitive study is a CT scan, or Computed Tomography. SAL KHAN: I see, very cool. Well, thanks for this. This is useful. DR. MAHADEVAN: My pleasure.",science_health-and-medicine_healthcare-misc
" -  So we have g(x) being equal to x to the fourth minus x to the fifth, and what we wanna do without having to graph g, we want to figure out at what x values does g have a relative maximum? And just to remind us what's going on in a relative maximum, so let me draw a hypothetical function right over here, so a relative maximum is going to happen, so you can visually inspect this, okay that looks like a relative maximum. That's kind of a top of a mountain or top of a hill, these all look like relative maximum and what's in common? Well the graph, the function is going from increasing to decreasing at each of those points. It's going from increasing to decreasing. Increasing to decreasing at either of the points, or you could say that the first derivative is going from positive to negative. So if you look at this interval right over here, g prime is greater than zero, and then over the next interval when you're decreasing, g prime would be less than zero. So what we really need to think about is when does g prime, so let me see, relative, we care about relative maximum point, and so that's essentially asking when does g prime go from positive to negative? From, from, I wrote fror. From g prime greater than zero, to g prime less than zero, and the values that we could look at or the points are our critical points and critical points are where g prime is either zero or it is undefined. So let's think about it, where is g prime of x equal to zero? g prime of x is equal to zero when well let's just take g prime of x. We're gonna leverage the power rule right here, four x to the third power, four x to the third, minus five x to the fourth. Minus five x to the fourth is equal to zero. Let's see, we can factor out an x to the third. So we have x to the third times four minus five x is equal to zero. So this is going to happen when x is equal to zero. Let me not skip steps. So this is going to happen when x to the third is equal to zero, or four minus five x is equal to zero. For x to the third equaling zero, that's only gonna happen when x is equal to zero, and four minus five x equaling zero, we'll add five x to both sides, you get four is equal to five x, divide both sides by five, you get 4/5 is equal to x. So here these are the two places, where our derivative is equal to zero. Now are there any places where our derivative is undefined? Well our function right over here is just a straight up polynomial. Our derivative is another polynomial, it is defined for all real numbers. So these are our two critical points, or we could even say critical values. Now let's think of what g prime is doing on either side of these critical values, and I'll draw a little number line here to help us visualize this, and so. So there we go, little bit of a number line. Let's see we care about zero and we care about 4/5. So let's say this is negative 1, this is zero, this is one, and so we have one critical point at, let me do this in magenta, we have one critical point here at x equals zero, and then we have another critical point. I will do this at x equals 4/5. So 4/5 is right around there. So that is 4/5 and let's just think about what g prime is doing in these intervals, and these critical points are the only places where g prime might switch sides, switch signs. So let's first think about this, let me pick some colors I haven't used yet. So let's think about the interval from negative infinity to zero. So this is the open interval from negative infinity to zero, and we could just plug in a value, let's try negative one, negative one is pretty straight forward to evaluate. So let's see you have four, you're gonna have four times negative one to the third power. So that's gonna be four times negative one, minus five times negative one to the fourth power. So that's just gonna be one. So let's see this is going to be negative four minus five. Which is negative nine, so right over here, g prime is equal to negative nine, and so we know over this whole interval, since it's to the left of this critical point, we know that g prime of x is less than zero, and so our function itself is decreasing over this interval and so we know we need to go from increasing to decreasing, so you can already say well we can't go from increasing to decreasing at this critical point, because we're already decreasing to the left of it, but anyway let's just think about what's happening at the other intervals. So in the interval between zero and 4/5, so that interval right over there, so it's between zero and 4/5, well let's just sample a number there. Let's say the number, I don't know, 1/2? Might be fairly straightforward. So we can evaluate g prime of 1/2, g prime of 1/2, is equal to four times 1/2 to the third power. 1/2 to the third power is 1/8. So it's 4/8, or it's just 1/2 minus five times 1/2 to the fourth so that's 5/16 minus 5/16 and so this is equal to 8/16 minus 5/16 which is equal to 3/16, but the important thing is it's equal to a positive value. So in this blue interval right over there, and actually let me put 4/5 in a different color so we see that it's not part of that interval. So in this light blue interval right here between zero and 4/5, g prime, g prime of x is greater than zero. So we know our function is increasing, and so let's see what's happening to the right of this, and the easiest value to try out would just be one. So let's try out x equals one. It's in that interval. So when x equals one, I'll just write g prime of one is equal to four minus five. Four minus five, which is equal to negative one. So g prime of x is less than zero, g prime of x is less than zero. So our function, so we could say g is increasing here. It is decreasing, oh sorry let me be careful, g is decreasing here. The function itself is decreasing cause our derivative is negative. Then our function is increasing here cause our derivative is positive, and then our function is decreasing here. So at what critical point are we going from increasing to decreasing? Well we're doing that at x equals 4/5. So we have a relative maximum at x equals 4/5. 4/5, if they said, ""Well where do we have ""a relative minimum point?"" Well that's going to be happen at x equals zero. We're going from decreasing to increasing, but we've answered their question of where do we find a relative maximum point.",math_old-ap-calculus-bc_bc-derivatives-analyze-functions
" -  Okay, there's one more feature of complex numbers that I want to share with you and we'll do that down here. So, our definition of j is j squared equals minus one, and now what I want to do is a sequence of multiplications by j. This is a really important property of this imaginary unit. We're gonna do powers of j and I'm going to plot them, while we're doing that I'm gonna plot them on the imaginary, or on the complex plane. So, this is the real axis and this is the imaginary axis. So, I'm gonna take powers of j, so first one j to the zero, and anything to the zero is one, so j to the zero is one and if we plot that on the imaginary axis, here's one, and there's no real part. So, it's just right on the real axis. Okay, let's do j to the one, that's j times itself one time, so that is equal to j. If I plot that number, that's up here, that's up on the imaginary axis right there, there's j. Alright, this has no real part, it's all imaginary. Let's keep going. Let's do j squared and what is that equal to? Well, I wrote it down up here, j squared is equal to minus one. So, j squared is equal to minus one, where's that in the complex plane? That's over here at minus one, on the real axis, no imaginary part. Let's do the next one. Let's do j cubed. What is that equal to? J to the third power is equal to j squared times j and we have those two right here, j squared is minus one and j to the one is j, so that equals minus j, and where do we plot that? We plot that down on the imaginary axis in the complex plane, right here, minus j. Okay, now we've got four answers. Let's go one or two more. Okay, j to the fourth is equal to what? It's equal to j squared times j squared. Let's look that up. It's minus one times minus one, and what does that equal to? That equals one. So, let's go plot that. Well, we've already plotted it, so that's this answer right here. Alright, so we already have that, let's do one more. J to the fifth, what is that equal to? That equals j to the fourth times j, and j to the fourth is right here, it's one times j equals j, let's go plot that one. Well, we've already plotted it, it's already right here. Okay, so, you can see there's a pattern here, one j minus one minus j. One j, it's gonna by minus one and minus j, it keeps repeating. Here's what's interesting about this, okay. If we draw this as vectors, if I draw these imaginary numbers as vectors, when I multiply by j, when I multiplied one by j, it rotated it 90 degrees and then that was the first step right here when I multiplied one times j, I got j. Now, when we went to j squared, we ended up at minus one. So, multiplying by j again, caused the vector to go down here, like that and that was another 90 degrees and if I take it again, the next one went this way and the final one went this way. So, this is the property of j, this is the key property of the imaginary unit, multiplying by the imaginary unit, the nature of it is this 90 degree rotation. There's this idea of a number that causes other numbers to rotate and that's the feature of j that makes it super important and it's the reason we use imaginary numbers in electrical engineering. So, the key idea here is that j rotates. That's the point. That's what we love about j. So, the last thing I want to mention is the negative powers of j. What happens if we have j to the minus one? Let's figure out what that means. So, that, of course, is one over j and if I multiply this by j over j and anything over itself is one, so I haven't changed the value of this and that equals j on top over j times j or j squared and what is j squared equal to? We wrote it down right here, j squared is minus one, so this equals j over minus 1 or equals minus j. So, whenever we see a j in a fraction, j to the minus one, basically it introduces a minus sign and the j comes up to the top out of the fraction. So, j to the minus one equals minus j and we'll use that occasionally to help us in our math. So, this was a really quick review of complex numbers and if any of this was new to you, I really encourage you to go back and watch Sal's videos on complex numbers and if this is something you've seen before, I hope it knocked off some of the rust and we're ready to go and use these numbers.",science_electrical-engineering_ee-circuit-analysis-topic
" -  What I would like to do in this video is explore the connection between the binary number system which is clearly, or we've already talked about this, is base two. Explore the quotient between that and the hexadecimal, hexadecimal number system, which is base 16. The reason why this is interesting is because 16 is a power of two. What we'll see is you could always view the hexadecimal number system. It's almost condensed representation of the binary number system. This is actually why you will actually, we've already talked about the binary system is used extensively in computer science and in even computer engineering. It's the underlying things that are happening or it's the representation used when we talk about logic gates and transistors and things like that. But hexadecimal also shows up a lot because it's kind of a condensed representation of base two. What do I mean by that? Let's write out a arbitrary number in base two. Let's say I have one, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero. This right over here is in binary and I can even write in parenthesis . This is a binary representation. I want to convert this to hexadecimal representation. I encourage you to pause the video and try out in your own. I'll give you a clue on how you could think about converting directly from base two to base 16. Think about which one over here is in the 16s place and what is the 256 place over here. Then that might help you convert directly. Assuming you had a go at it. The really fun thing about between base two and base 16 is you don't have to, well for any bases, you really don't have to go through base 10 but these in particular, it's especially easy to go convert between these two bases. The realization that you have to make is, what are the powers, which places here are powers of 16? This right over here, that is the ones place. One way to think about it is all of these is going to tell you how many ones we have. Ones, twos, fours, and eights, but another way to think about it is this is a count of ones, all the way up to a potential of 15 ones. This could count, this is going to be between zero, and I'm going to write it down. Actually, let me write it down in base 16. It's going to be between zero and F. It's going to be between zero and 15. It's kind of a count between the number of ones, I guess you could say. Then this is the 16s place. I'm going to do that in different color. This right over here is the 16s place. You could have between zero and 15s, 16s. This is also going to be between zero and F, when you look at this four digit binary numbers. Once again, this whole thing right over here is essentially going to tell you how many 16s you have. This whole thing is going to tell you how many ones you have. Then the next four, we could keep going, although there is only one place here. We could go, this right over here is the 256s place. This is going to be the next four digits. They really have one right over here, but one, two, three, and then the fourth one. This is also going to be between zero and 15, 256s. Hopefully, that helps you a little bit. Actually, if this was a clue, I encourage you to pause the video again (laughs) and see if you can represent this in hexadecimal. Let's try to work this thing together. How many ones do we have? What number is this? These four digits right over here. This is eight plus four plus two. So eight plus four is 12, plus two is 14. This right over here is 14. How do we represent that in hexadecimal? Well, 14 is one less than 15 so it's going to be E. This is going to be E. This is E. E is our hexadecimal representation of the number 14 comes right before our representation of the number 15 F. Alright, now, how many 16s do we have? Let's see, I have no eights. I have a four, and I have a two. We're going to have six 16s. So we're going to have six 16s. Then, how many 256s do I have? I only have one 256. One 256. This number in hexadecimal, and I could write that. This is in hexadecimal right over here, is one, six, E. One, six, E. I guess you could call this 256 E, 16 E. I guess 14. I (laughs) finally have to come up with a better way of reading this hexadecimal number. If you're not curious what number is this, because you don't have to go through decimal just so you could comprehend it in the number system that you're used to operating in. One that's based off from the number of fingers you have. Feel free to do so.",math_algebra-home_alg-intro-to-algebra
" -  We are told that a sample of a compound containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms is completely combusted, producing 5.65 grams of carbon dioxide and 3.47 grams of H2O or water. What is the empirical formula of the compound? So pause this video and see if you can work through that. All right, now let's just try to make sure we understand what's going on. They say that I have some mystery compound. It only contains carbon and hydrogen, so it's going to have some number of carbon, I'll call that x. Some number of hydrogens, I'll call that y. We're going to put it in the presence of molecular oxygen and it's going to combust and after it's combusted, I'm going to end up with some carbon dioxide and some water. And what I just drew here, this is a chemical reaction that I'm describing. I haven't balanced it. I could try to, even with the x's and y's, but that's not the point of this video. The point of this video is they tell us how many grams of the carbon dioxide we have and how many grams of the water we have, they tells us that right over there. And so what we need to do is say, all right, from that, we can figure out how many moles of carbon dioxide we have, how many moles of water we have, and from that, we can figure out how many moles of carbon did we start with and how many moles of hydrogen did we start with? And if we look at those ratios, then we can come up with the empirical formula of the compound. So just to start, because I'm going to be thinking about molar moles and molar masses and the mass of a mole of a molecule or an atom, let's just get the average atomic mass for carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen for us to work with. So I'll get out our handy periodic table. We can see hydrogen has an average atomic mass of 1.008. Let me write that down. So we have hydrogen is at 1.008, and then we have carbon, and carbon is at 12.01. So carbon is at 12.01, and we could also think about them in terms of molar masses. We could say this is gram per mole, grams per mole, and then last, but not least, we have oxygen and then oxygen is at 16.00 grams per mole. It's the average atomic mass, but whether we can think of that as molar mass, that number is molar mass. So oxygen is at 16.00 grams per mole. And so now we can try to figure out how many moles of C in the product do we have? So we can see that all of the carbon in the product is in the carbon dioxide that's in the product, and so we have 5.65 grams of CO2. We can think about how many moles of CO2 that is, so times one mole of CO2 for every how many grams of CO2. Well, we just have to think about, actually, let me just put it right over here. CO2, you're going to have, let's see, you have one carbon and two oxygens. So it is going to be 12.01 plus two times 16. Two times 16.00 grams per mole, and so let's see. This would get us to, this is 32 plus 12.01, so that is 44.01. And that's grams per mole, but now we're thinking about moles per gram, so it's going to be one over 44.01 and so if we did just this, the grams of CO2 would cancel the grams of CO2 and this would give us moles of CO2, but I care about moles of carbon in the product. So how many moles of carbon are there for every mole of CO2? Well we know that we have one mole of carbon for every one mole of CO2. Every carbon dioxide molecule has one carbon in it, and so what is this going to get us? So we have 5.65 divided by, divided by 44.01, and then times one, so I don't have to do anything there. That is equal to, I'll round it to three digits here, so 0.128, so this is 0.128 and my units here are, let's see. The grams of carbon dioxide cancel the grams of carbon dioxide. The moles of carbon dioxide cancel the moles of carbon dioxide, so I am exactly where I want to be. This is how many moles of carbon that I have. And you can do the dimensional analysis, but it also makes intuitive sense, hopefully. If this is how many grams of carbon dioxide we have and a mole of carbon dioxide is going to have a mass of 44.01 grams, well then 5.65 over this is going to tell us how, what fraction of a mole we have of carbon dioxide and then whatever that number of moles we have of carbon dioxide is gonna be the same as the moles of carbon, 'cause we have one atom of carbon for every carbon dioxide molecule, so that all makes sense. And now let's do the same for hydrogen. So let's think about moles of hydrogen in the product, and it's going to be the same exercise. And if you're so inspired and you didn't calculate it in the beginning, I encourage you to try to do this part on your own. All right, so all of the hydrogen is in the water, so and we know that we have, in our product, 3.47 grams of water. 3.47 grams of H2O, and now let's think about how many moles of H2O that is. So that's going to be, let's see, every one mole of H2O is going to have a mass of how many grams of H2O? And we could do that up here. H2O, it's going to be, we have two hydrogens, so it's going to be two times 1.008 plus the mass, the average atomic mass of the oxygen is going to be plus 16, but we can also view that as what would be the mass in grams, if you had a mole of it? And so this is going to be in grams per mole, and so this is going to be, let's see, two times 1.008. This part over here is 2.016, and then you add 16 to it. It's going to be 18.016. 18.016, and then if I just calculated this, this would give me how many moles of water I have in my product, but I care about moles of hydrogen. And so how many moles of hydrogen do I have for every mole of water? So for how many moles of hydrogen for every mole of water? Well I'm going to have two moles of hydrogen for every mole of water because in each water molecule, I have two hydrogens. And so that's going to cancel out with that and we're just going to be left with moles of hydrogen. And so this is going to be equal to, I'll take my 3.47 grams of water, divide it by the, how much, how many grams a mole of water, what its mass would be, so divided by 18.016. This is how many moles of water I have. Now for every, for every molecule of water, I have two hydrogens, so then I will multiply by two. Times two is equal to zero point, I'll just round three digits right over here. 0.385. 0.385 moles of hydrogen. So now we know the number of hydrogen atoms. We know the number of carbon atoms, and to figure out the empirical formula of the compound, we can think about the ratio between the two, so I'm gonna find the ratio of hydrogens to carbons. And that is going to be equal to, I have 0.385 moles of hydrogen over, over 0.128 moles of carbon. 0.128 moles of carbon, and what is this equal to? And it looks like it's going to be roughly three, but let me verify that. In my head, that seems so, I already have the hydrogen there, and so if I divide it by 0.128, I get, yep, pretty close to three. Now actually, I think if I, yep, pretty close to three, so there you go. This is approximately three, and so I can, with pretty good confidence, this was very close to three. I could say for every carbon, I have three hydrogens in my original compound, in this thing right over here. So the empirical formula of our original compound for every one carbon, I have three hydrogens. So CH3, and we are done.",science_chemistry_chemical-reactions-stoichiome
" -  Mrs. Henry's class has 64 crayons. At the end of the year only 31 crayons remain. How many crayons have been used? And they give us a picture here. So, the beginning of the year, this is 64 crayons. Six tens and four ones. One, two, three, four, five, six tens, and one, two, three, four ones. So this is 64 at the beginning of the year, and at the end of the year only 31 crayons remain. Well, 31 is three tens and one one. Three tens. One ten, two tens, three tens, and one one. So how many have been used? And try to pause the video and try it on your own. All right, I assume you have tried it. Let's do it together. So there's a couple of ways to do it. If we didn't have the picture here, we would say all right, she started, her class started with 64 crayons, they used some, so if we are using crayons that would kind of subtract the crayons away. So if you're using some crayons, you would subtract some number from 64, so I'm just gonna put a blank here. So 64 minus the number that are used is going to be equal to the number that remain. So this is going to be equal to what's left over, and they tell us that 31 crayons remain. 31 crayons remain. So, we need to figure out what's here? What is this blank? 64 minus blank is 31. Well, if 64 minus blank is 31, then I can swap the 31 and the blank. That means that 64 minus 31 is going to be equal to blank. That means that 64 minus 31 is going to be equal to blank. How did I do that? How do I think about that? Well, imagine 64 things. So if this block represents 64. So this is 64, just like that, and if this is 31, and then this is our blank. We know that the blank, so I could put a question mark here if I like. I could put a question mark. So this is the question mark. So we know that 64 minus the question mark would be 31. Or that 31 plus question mark would be 64. Or that 64 minus 31 is going to get us the question mark right over here. So we just have to figure out what 64 minus 31 is. And let's do that. Let's do that right over here. So 64 minus 31, and it's going to be equal to, so let's look at that ones place. Four ones minus one one is going to be three ones. Six tens minus three tens is three tens. So the blank is 33. And you could check that, 64 minus 33 is 31. Or 64 minus 31 is 33. So 33 crayons have been used. Now since they made this neat picture for us, we actually could have just used the picture. How would we have done that? Well, this is what they started with. This is the 64. Six tens. One, two, three, four, five, six tens, and one, two, three, four ones. So 64, and they end up with 31. So how many of the tens do we use up to go from what we started with to what we finish with? Well, we end up using, let's see, there's only three tens here. There were six tens here. So we used one, two, three tens. So we used up three tens. And how many ones do we use up? Well, we have four ones here, and we only have one right over here. So we use up three ones. We used up three ones. If you take away these three tens, and these three ones, you'll be left with the same number of crayons that we have at the end of the year. So we use up three, I guess you could say, we used up three ten packs, and we used up three ones. So what's that going to be? Well, three tens plus three ones is 33.",math_cc-2nd-grade-math_cc-2nd-add-subtract-100
" On Saturday, William's parents gave birth to twins and named them Nadia and Vanessa. When they were first born, Nadia weighed 7.27 pounds and was 21.5 inches tall, and Vanessa weighed 8.34 pounds. How much did the babies weigh in total? So they tell us Nadia weighed 7.27 and Vanessa weighed 8.34. We have to add those up. And really, they just gave us this. The length of Nadia at birth really is a distraction, just so that we just don't mindlessly add any numbers we see. So this is really unnecessary information just to distract us. So we need to add Nadia's birth weight plus Vanessa's. So it's 7.27. So 7.27 plus 8.34. And it's always important that we line up the decimal. And I'd like to do the decimal first. So it's 8.34. And we'll just add these two up. So 7 plus 4, and this is really 7/100 plus 4/100 is 11/100, which is the same thing as 1/100 and 1/10. 1/10 plus 2/10 plus 3/10 is 6/10.

In a neutral atom, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons, because in a neutral atom there's no overall charge and the positive charges of the protons completely balance with the negative charges of the electrons. So let's go ahead and draw an atom of hydrogen. We know the atomic number of hydrogen is one, so there's one proton in the nucleus. So there's my one proton in the nucleus, and we're talking about a neutral hydrogen atom, so there's one electron. I'm going to draw that one electron somewhere outside the nucleus and I'm going to use the oversimplified Bohr model. So this isn't actually what an atom looks like, but it's a very simply view that helps you get started. So this is one, this one version of hydrogen. This is one isotope of hydrogen. So this is called protium. Let me go ahead and write that here. So this is protium and let's talk about isotopes. An isotope, isotopes are atoms of a single element. So we're talking about hydrogen here. That differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei. So let's talk about the next isotope of hydrogen. So this is called deuteriums. Let me go ahead and write deuterium here. Deuterium is hydrogen, so it must have one proton in the nucleus and it must have one electron outside the nucleus, but if you look at the definition for isotopes, atoms of a single element that differ in the number of neutrons, protium has zero neutrons in the nucleus. Deuterium has one. So let me go ahead and draw in deuterium's one neutron. I'll use blue here, so neutrons are going to be blue. So deuterium has one neutron and since neutrons have mass, deuterium has more mass than protium. So isotopes have different masses because they differ in terms of number of neutrons. Notice though, that they have the same atomic number, they have the same number of protons in the nucleus. Right, it's one proton in the nucleus. And that's important because if you change the number of protons, you're changing the element, and that's not what we're doing here. We're talking about atoms of a single element. Deuterium is still hydrogen, it's an isotope. Finally, our last isotope, which is tritium. So tritium has one proton in the nucleus, one electron outside the nucleus, and we draw that in here, and it must differ in terms of number of neutrons, so tritium has two neutrons. Let me go ahead and draw the two neutrons here in the nucleus. And so those are the isotopes of hydrogen. How do we distinguish between the different isotopes? Well we're going to write little symbols to represent these isotopes. And so the symbol that we'll draw here for protium is going to have the element symbol, which is, of course, hydrogen, and then down here we're going to write the atomic number. So the subscript is the atomic number which is one, because there's one proton in the nucleus, and then for the superscript, we're going to write in the mass number. So let me move down here so we can look at the definition for the mass number. The mass number is the combined number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus, so it's protons and neutrons, and it's symbolized by A. So A is the mass number, which is equal to the number of protons, that's the atomic number which we symbolized by Z, plus the number of neutrons. So A is equal to Z plus N. And for protium, let's look at protium here. So in the nucleus there's only one proton and zero neutrons, so one plus zero gives us a mass number of one. And I'll use red here for mass number so we can distinguish. Alright, so mass number is red and let me use a different color here for the atomic number. Let me use magenta here. So the subscript is the atomic number and that's Z, and the superscript is the mass number and that's A. So this symbol represents the protium isotope. Let's draw one for deuterium. So it's hydrogen so we put an H here. There is still one proton in the nucleus, right one proton in the nucleus, so we put an atomic number of one. The mass number is the superscript, it's the combined number of protons and neutrons. So we look in the nucleus here. There's one proton and one neutron. So one plus one is equal to two. So we put a two here for the superscript. And finally for tritium, it's still hydrogen. So we put hydrogen here. There's one proton in the nucleus, atomic number of one, so we put a one here. And then the combined numbers of protons and neutrons, that would be three. So one proton plus two neutrons gives us three. So there's the symbol for tritium. So here are the isotopes of hydrogen and using these symbols allows us to differentiate between them. So let's take what we've learned and do a few more practice problems here. So let's look at a symbol for carbon. So here we have carbon with subscript six, superscript 12. And if we want to know how many protons, electrons and neutrons there are. So let's first think about protons. Well we know that the subscript is the atomic number and the atomic number is equal to the number of protons. So there are six protons in this atom of carbon. And if it's a neutral atom of carbon, the number of electrons must be equal to the number of protons. So if there are six protons, there must also be six electrons. And finally, how do we figure out the number of neutrons? Well let's go ahead and write down the formula we discussed. The mass number is equal to the atomic number plus the number of neutrons. So the mass number was right here, that's 12. So we can put in a 12. The atomic number was six, right here. So we put in a six. Plus the number of neutrons. Plus the number of neutrons. So the number of neutrons is just equal to 12 minus six, which is, of course, six. So there are six neutrons. So just subtract the atomic number from the mass number and you'll get the number of neutrons in your atom. Let's do another one. This is carbon and this time we have a superscript of 13. The atomic number doesn't change when you're talking about an isotope. If you change the atomic number, you change the element. So there's still six protons in the nucleus of this atom and in a neutral atom, there must be the equal number of electrons. So six electrons and then finally, how many neutrons are there? Well just like we did before, we subtract the atomic number from the mass number. So we just have to 13 minus six to figure out the number of neutrons. So 13 minus six is, of course, seven. So there are seven neutrons in this atom. Another way to represent isotopes, let's say we wanted to represent this isotope in a different way, sometimes you'll see it where you write the name of the element. So this is carbon. And then you put a hyphen here and then you put the mass number. So carbon hyphen 13 refers to this isotope of carbon and this is called hyphen notation. So let me go ahead and write this hyphen notation. Alright, let's do one more example here. Let's do one that looks a little bit scarier. So let's do uranium. So U is uranium. The atomic number of uranium is 92. The mass number for this isotope is 235. So how many protons, electrons, and neutrons in this atom of uranium? So once again for protons, we look at the atomic number, that's 92. So there must be 92 protons. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. So there are 92 electrons and then finally, to figure out the number of neutrons, we subtract this number from the mass number. So we just need to do 235 minus 92. And that gives us 143. So there are 143 neutrons.",science_chemistry_atomic-structure-and-properties
" So you, as the ancient philosopher in mathematics have concluded in order for the multiplication of positive and negative numbers to be consistent with everything you've been constructing so far with all the other properties of multiplication that you know so far that you need a negative number times a positive number or a positive times a negative to give you a negative number and a negative times a negative to give you a positive number and so you accept it's all consistent so far.. this deal does not make complete concrete sense to you, you want to have a slightly deeper institution than just having to accept its consistent with the distributive property and whatever else and so you try another thought experiment, you say ""well what is just a basic multiplication way of doing it?"" So if I say, two times three, one way to to conceptualize is basic multiplication is really repeating addition, so you could view this as two threes so let me write three plus three and notice there are two of them, there are two of these or you could view this as three twos, and so this is the same thing as two plus two plus two and there are three of them, and either way you can conceptualize as you get the same exact answer. This is going to be equal to six, fair enough! Now, you knew this before you even tried to tackle negative numbers. Now let's try to make one of these negatives and see what happens. Let's do two times negative three, I want to make the negative into a different color. Two times negative three. Well, one way you could view this is the same analogy here, it's negative three twice so it would be negative.. I'll try to color code it negative three and then another negative three or you could say negative three minus three or, and this is the interesting thing, instead of over here there's a two times positive three you added two, three times. But since here is two times negative three you could also imagine you are going to subtract two, three times So instead of up here, I could written two plus two plus two because this is a positive two right over here, but since we're doing this over negative three we could imagine subtracting two, three times, so this would be subtracting two (repeated) subtract another two right over here, subtract another two and then you subtract another two notice you did it, once again, you did it three times, so this is a negative three, so essentially you are subtracting two, three times. And either way, you can conceptualize right over here, you are going to get negative six negative six is the answer. Now, so you are already starting to feel better about this part right over here negative times a positive, or a positive times a negative is going to give you a negative. Now lets take to the really un-intuitive one and measure negative times a negative, and all of a sudden negatives kind of cancel to give you a positive. Now why is that the case? Well we can just build from this example right over here. Let's say we had a negative two, lets say we had negative two, let me do it a different color, let's say we had a negative two, I already used this color negative two times negative three. So now, we can d- actually I'll do this one first. Let's do multiplying something by negative three so we'll repeatedly subtract that thing three times whatever that thing is so now the thing isn't a positive two so the thing over here is a positive two but the thing we're going to subtract is a negative two So let me make it clear, this says we are going to subtract something three times, so we subtract something three times, so subtracting something (repeatedly) three times That's what this part right over here tells us and we'll do this, exactly three times Over here, it was a positive two we subtracted three times, now we're going to do a negative two, now we're going to do a negative two and we know from subtracting negative numbers, we already built this intuition that subtracting a negative is the same thing it's the same thing as adding a positive, and so this this is going to be the same thing as two plus two plus two and we're told once again, gives you a positive six, you can same use the same logic over here, now instead of adding negative three twice, really I could have written this as negative three as this example negative three negative three, and we added it we added it, now let me put a plus here to make it clear over here we added it twice, we added negative three two times, or here since we have a negative two, we're going to subtract to negative three twice, so we're going to subtract something and we're going to subtract something again, and that something is going to be our negative three, it's going to be our negative three, so negative, negative and put our three right over here and once again, subtracting negative three is like taking away someone's debt, which is essentially giving them money, this is the same thing as adding three plus three which is once again six. So now you, the ancient philosopher, feel pretty good. Not only this all consistent with all the mathematics you know the distributive property is also the property of multiplying something times something all these things you already know, and now this actually makes conceptual sense to you, this is actually very consistent with with your notion, your original notion, or one of the possible notions of multiplication which is as repeated addition",math_in-in-class-7-math-kv_in-in-7-kv-integers
" -  So we wanna evaluate the definite integral from negative one to negative two of 16 minus x to the third over x to the third dx. Now at first this might seem daunting, I have this rational expression, I have xs in the numerators and xs in the denominators, but we just have to remember, we just have to do some algebraic manipulation, and this is going to seem a lot more attractable. This is the same thing as the definite integral from negative one to negative two of 16 over x to the third minus x to the third over x to the third, minus x to the third over x to the third dx. And now what is that going to be equal to? That is going be equal to the definite integral from negative one to negative two of, I could write this first term right over here, let me do this in a different color. I could write, I could write this as 16x to the negative three, x to the negative three, and this second one, we have minus x to the third over x to the third. Well x to the third is just over, x to the third over x to the third is just going to be equal to one. So this is going to be minus one dx, so dx. And so what is this going to be equal to? Well, let's take the antiderivative of each of these parts and then we're going to have to evaluate them at the different bounds. So, let's see. The antiderivative of 16x to the negative three, we're just gonna do the power rule for derivatives in reverse. You can view this as the power rule of integration or the power rule of taking the antiderivative where what you do is you're gonna increase our exponent by one, so you're gonna go from negative three to negative two, and then you're gonna divide by that amount, by negative two. So it's going to be 16 divided by negative two times x to the negative two. All I did is I increased the exponent and I divided by that amount. So that's the antiderivative here. And 16 divided by negative two, that is just negative eight. So we have negative eight, x to the negative two. And then the antiderivative of negative one, well, that's just negative x, negative, negative x, negative x. And actually you might just know that, and then hey, if I take the derivative of negative x I get negative one, or if you view this as negative x to the zero power, because that's what one is, well, it's the same thing. You increase the exponent by one to get x to the first power. And then you divide by one and so, I mean, you can view it as that right over there, but either way you get to negative or minus x. And so now we want to evaluate that. We're going to evaluate that at the bounds and take the difference. So we're going to evaluate that at negative two and then subtract from that this evaluated at negative one. And let me do those in two different colors so we can see what's going on. So we're gonna evaluate it at negative two and we're gonna evaluate it at negative one. So let's first evaluate it at negative two. So this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to, when you evaluate it at negative two, it's going to be negative eight, negative eight times x to the negative two. So negative two the the negative two power minus negative two. And from that we're going to subtract it and evaluate it at negative one. So, it's going to be negative eight times negative one to the negative two power minus negative one. All right, so then what is this going to be? So, negative two the negative two. So negative two to the negative two is equal to one over negative two squared, which is equal to 1/4. So this is equal to positive 1/4, but then negative eight times positive 1/4 is going to be equal to negative two. And then we have negative two minus negative two, so that's negative two plus two. And so everything I've just done in this purplish color that is just going to be zero. And then if we look at what's going on in the orange, when you evaluate it at negative one, let's see, negative one to the negative two power, well, that's one over negative one squared. Well, this all is just going to be one. And so we're gonna have negative eight plus one, which is equal to negative seven. So all of this evaluates to negative seven. But remember, we're subtracting negative seven, and so this is going to result, we deserve a little bit of a drum roll, this is going to be equal to positive, positive seven. And obviously you don't have to write that positive out in front, I just wrote that just to emphasize that this is going to be a positive seven.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-definite-integrals
" In a previous video, we derived the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series where a is the first term and r is our common ratio. What I want to do in this video is now think about the sum of an infinite geometric series. And I've always found this mildly mind blowing because, or actually more than mildly mind blowing, because you're taking the sum of an infinite things but as we see, you can actually get a finite value depending on what your common ratio is. So there's a couple of ways to think about it. One is, you could say that the sum of an infinite geometric series is just a limit of this as n approaches infinity. So we could say, what is the limit as n approaches infinity of this business, of the sum from k equals zero to n of a times r to the k. Which would be the same thing as taking the limit as n approaches infinity right over here. So that would be the same thing as the limit as n approaches infinity of all of this business. Let me just copy and paste that so I don't have to keep switching colors. So copy and then paste. So what's the limit as n approaches infinity here? Let's think about that for a second. I encourage you to pause the video, and I'll give you one hint. Think about it for r is greater than one, for r is equal to one, and actually let me make it clear-- let's think about it for the absolute values of r is greater than one, the absolute values of r equal to one, and then the absolute value of r less than one. Well, I'm assuming you've given a go at it. So if the absolute value of r is greater than one, as this exponent explodes, as it approaches infinity, this number is just going to become massively, massively huge. And so the whole thing is just going to become, or at least you could think of the absolute value of the whole thing, is just going to become a very, very, very large number. If r was equal to one, then the denominator is going to become zero. And we're going to be dividing by that denominator, and this formula just breaks down. But where this formula can be helpful, and where we can get this to actually give us a sensical result, is when the absolute value of r is between zero and one. We've already talked about, we're not even dealing with the geometric, we're not even talking about a geometric series if r is equal to zero. So let's think about the case where the absolute value of r is greater than zero, and it is less than one. What's going to happen in that case? Well, the denominator is going to make sense, right over here. And then up here, what's going to happen? Well, if you take something with an absolute value less than one, and you take it to higher and higher and higher exponents, every time you multiply it by itself, you're going to get a number with a smaller absolute value. So this term right over here, this entire term, is going to go to zero as n approaches infinity. Imagine if r was 1/2. You're talking about 1/2 to the hundredth power, 1/2 to the thousandth power, 1/2 to the millionth power, 1/2 to the billionth power. That quickly approaches zero. So this goes to zero if the absolute value of r is less than one. So this, we could argue, would be equal to a over one minus r. So for example, if I had the geometric series, if I had the infinite geometric series-- let's just have a simple one. Let's say that my first term is one, and then each successive term I'm going to multiply by 1/3. So it's one plus 1/3 plus 1/3 squared plus 1/3 to the third plus, and I were to just keep on going forever. This is telling us that that sum, this infinite sum-- I have an infinite number of terms here-- this is a pretty fascinating concept here-- will come out to this. It's going to be my first term, one, over one minus my common ratio. My common ratio in this case is 1/3. One minus 1/3, which is the same thing as one over 2/3, which is equal to 3/2, or you could view it as one and 1/2. That's a mildly amazing thing.",math_calculus-2_cs2-series
" In Johannesburg in June, the daily low temperature is usually around 3 degrees Celsius and the daily high temperature is around 18 degrees Celsius. The temperature is typically halfway between the daily high and the daily low at both 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. and the highest temperatures are in the afternoon. Write a trigonometric function that models the temperature capital T in Johannesburg lowercase t hours after midnight. So let's see if we can start to think about what a graph might look like of all of this. So this, let's say this is our temperature axis in Celsius degrees. So that is temperature, temperature, and I'm actually going to first, I'm going to do two different functions. So that's my temperature axis. And this right over here is my time in hours. So, that's lower case t, time in hours and lets think about the range of temperatures. So the daily low temperature is around 3 degrees Celsius. So lets actually, and the high is 18, so lets make this right over here 18, this right over here is 3 and we can also think about the midpoint between 18 and 3 that we hit at both 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. 18 plus 3 is 21 divided by 2 is 10.5. So the midpoint, or we can say the mid line of our trigonometric function is going to be 10.5 degrees Celsius. Let me draw the mid line. So we're going to essentially oscillate around this right over here, we're going to oscillate around this. The daily high is around 18 degrees Celsius. The daily high is around 18 degrees Celsius and the daily low is around 3 degrees, 3 degrees Celsius, just like that. So we're going to oscillate around this mid line. We're going to hit the lows and the highs. Now to simplify things because we hit this 10.5 degrees at 10 a.m. and 10 p.m., to simplify this I'm not going to tackle their question that they want immediately, the hour in terms of t hours after midnight. I'm going to define a new function. F of t, F of lowercase t which is equal to the temperature, temperature in Johannesburg, we're assuming everything is in Johannesburg. Temperature t hours after, I'm going to say t hours after 10 a.m. The reason why I'm picking 10 a.m. is because we know that the temperature is right at the mid line at 10 a.m. t hours after 10 a.m. Because if I want a graph F of t at t equals zero that means we're at 10 a.m., that means that we're halfway between, they tell us, we're halfway between the daily low and the daily high. Now what is the period of this trigonometric function going to be? Well after 24 hours we're back to 10 am, so our period is going to be 24 hours. So we put 24 hours there and then this is, halfway is 12 hours. So what happens after 12 hours? After 12 hours we're back at 10 p.m. where we're back at midway between our lows and our highs. And then after 24 hours we're back at 10 a.m. again so those are going to be points on F of t. And now lets think about what will happen as we go beyond, as we start at 10 a.m. and go forward. So as we start at 10 a.m. and go forward they tell us that the hottest part, the highest temperatures are in the afternoon. The afternoon is going to be around here. So we should be going up in temperature and the highest point is actually going to be halfway between these two so it's going to be 6 hours after 10 a.m. which is 4 p.m. so that's going to be the high at 4 p.m. So let me draw a curve, draw our curve like this. So it'll look like this. And then our low, so now we're at 10 p.m. and then you go 6 hours after 10 p.m. you're now at 4 a.m. which is going to be the low. This is 18 hours after 10 a.m. you're going to be at your low temperature, roughly right over there. And your curve will look something like this. So what would be, before we even try to model T of t, what would be an expression, and obviously we keep going like that we can even go hours before 10 a.m. This is obviously, just keeps on cycling on and on forever. Now, what would be an expression for F of t and I encourage you once again to pause the video and try to think about that. Well, one thing that you say, well this could be a sine or a co-sine function, actually you could model it with either of them but it's always easiest to do the simplest one. Which function is essentially at it's midline when the argument to the function is zero. Well the sine of zero is zero and if we didn't shift this function up or down the mid line of just a sine function, without it being shifted, is zero. So sine of zero, zero and then sine begins to increase and oscillate like this. So it feels like sine is a good candidate to model it with. Once again you could model it with either but I have a feeling that this is going to be a little bit simpler. Now lets think about the amplitude. Well how much do we vary, what's our maximum variance from our mid line? So here we are 7.5 above our mid line. Here we are 7.5 below our mid line. So our amplitude is 7.5 and actually let me just do that in a different color just so you see where things are coming from. So this is 7.5, this is 7.5, so our amplitude looks like it's 7.5. And now, what is our period? Well we've already talked about it, our period is 24, 24 hours. This distance right over here is 24 hours which makes completes sense, after 24 hours you're at the same point in the day. So we would divide 2 pie by the period, divided by 24 times t. And if you forget, hey you know divide 2 pie by the period here, you could just remind yourself that what t value will make us go from, so when t is equal to zero the whole argument to the sine function is going to be zero, that's when we're over here. And then when t is equal to 24 the whole argument is going to be 2 pie. So we would have made one rotation around the unit circle if you think about the input into the sine function. Now we're almost done. If I were to just graph this, this would be, have a mid line around zero but we see that we've shifted everything up by 10.5. So we have to shift everything up by 10.5. Now, this is, we've just successfully modeled it and we could simplify a little bit we could write this as pie over 12 instead of 2 pie over 24. But this right over here models the temperature in Johannesburg, t hours after 10 a.m., after 10 a.m. That's not what they wanted, they want us to model the temperature t hours after midnight. So what would T of t be? We're going to have to shift this a little bit. So lets just think about it a little bit, let me just write it out. So T of t, this is now, we're modeling t hours after, after midnight. So we're going to have this same amplitude. We're still going to have the same variance from the mid line. So it's going to be 7.5 times sine of, I should be doing it in the same color so you see what I'm changing and not changing. Times the sine of, instead of 2 pie over 24 I'll just write pie over 12, instead of writing t I'm going to shift t, either to the right or left. Actually you can shift in either direction because this is a periodic function we're going to have to think about how much we're shifting it. So t is going to be plus or minus something right over here. I'm going to shift it, plus 10.5. Plus 10.5, now this is always a little bit, at least in my brain I have to think about this in a lot of different ways so that I can make sure that I'm shifting it in the right direction. So here at 10 a.m. we were at this point. When t is equal to zero, this is zero hours after 10 a.m. But in this function when is 10 a.m. Well in this function 10 a.m., let me write it this way. 10 a.m. is ten hours after midnight. So T, capital T of 10, this is 10 hours after midnight should be equal to F of zero because here the argument is hours after 10 a.m. so this is 10 a.m. this right over here represents temperature, temperature at 10 a.m. and this over here, cause capital T function, this is hours after midnight. This is also temperature at 10 a.m. So we want T of 10 to be the same thing as F of zero. Or another way of thinking about it, when F of zero, this whole argument is zero. So we want this whole argument to be zero when T is equal to 10. So how would we do that? Well this is t minus 10, notice T of 10, you put a 10 here this whole thing becomes a zero. This whole thing becomes zero and you're left with 10.5 and over here F of zero well the same thing, this whole thing becomes a zero and all you're left with over here is 10.5. So T of 10 should be F of zero. So if we wanted to graph it, we've already answered their question. If we put a 10 here, the argument to the sine becomes zero, these two things are going to be equivalent. But lets actually graph this. So T of 10, so if we're graphing capital T, T of 10 so this is 6, 12 lets see so this is maybe, so 10 is going to be someplace around here. 1So T of 10 is going to be the same thing as F of zero. 1So it's going to be like that and then it's just 1going to, and then we've essentially just shifted 1everything to the right, everything to the right by 10. 1That makes sense because zero after whatever hours 1you are after 10 a.m. is going to be 10 more hours 1to get to that same point after midnight. 1So your curve is going to look, so this is going 1to be shifted by 10, this is going to be shifted 1by 10 and your curve is going to look something 1like, let me see my, this is going to be shifted by 110 so you're going to get, this is going to be at 16 hours, 1so it's going to look something like that. 1And of course it will keep oscillating like that. 1So essentially we just have to shift it to the right 1by 10, the argument we have to replace t with 1t minus 10 to do it and this was the logic y.",math_algebra-home_alg-trig-functions

Well acceleration, this is a velocity function right over here, so the acceleration is going to be derivative of the velocity function with respect to time. What is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time? That's acceleration. So we really just want to evaluate this, Bob's acceleration at t equals five, that's going to be B prime of five. So let's first figure out what B prime of t is. B prime of t is equal to, we'll take the derivative here. It's pretty straightforward. Just use the Power Rule. So it's going to be three t squared minus 12t, two times negative six is 12 or negative 12, and then the derivative of 300 doesn't change with respect to time, so it's just a zero. And so B prime of five is going to be equal to three times five squared minus 12 times five which is equal to 75 minus 60 which is equal to 15, and the units here, this is acceleration. So this is going to be, his velocity was in meters per minute, and so this is going meters per minute, per minute because remember, time is in terms of minutes. So we could write as meters, and we write it out meters per minute, per minute which is the same thing as meters per minute, meters per minute squared. All right. Let's do the next part. Based on the model B from part c, find Bob's average velocity during the interval from zero is less than or equal to t is less than or equal to 10. And if the notion of average velocity or average value of a function is completely foreign to you, I encourage you to watch the videos on Khan Academy on find the average of a function. But just to kind of cut to the chase, the average velocity, the average velocity, is going to be the area under the velocity curve divided by our change in time. So the area under the velocity curve from t equals zero to t equals 10 of B of t of B of t, dt, divided by our change in time. So it's going to be divided by, well you're going from zero to 10. So 10 minus zero is going to be equal to 10. And if you wanted the intuition here it's like well, if you know the area of something and if you wanted to find its average height, you could just divide by its width. And that's what we're doing here. If we know the area of something, we want to figure out its average height, and so you divide by its width. That's I guess a very high-level intuition for where this expression came from. And so this is going to be equal to one tenth times the integral from zero to 10, and B of t is t to the third power minus 6t squared plus 300 dt, and so this is going to be equal to one over 10. Take the anti-derivative here, so this is going to be t to the fourth over four, t to the fourth over four, and then this is going to be, if we increase the exponent here by what is t to the third, and then you divide by three. So it's negative six divided by three is negative two, t to the third, and then plus 300t, 300t, And I'm going to evaluate it. I am going to evaluate it at 10 and subtract from that and evaluate it at zero. And so this is going to be equal to, this is going to be equal to one tenth, that same one tenth there, and when you evaluate all this at 10 what'd everybody get? Let's see 10 to the fourth power is, 10 to the fourth power is 10,000 divided by four is 2,500, 2,500, and then minus two times 10 to the third. So it's two times a thousand. So minus 2,000. And then 300 times 10, well that's plus 3,000, and then you subtract all of this evaluated at zero which is just going to be zero. So this going to be equal to, 2,500 minus 2,000 is 500 plus 3,000. This is all, simplifies to 3,500, or 3,500, and then you divide it by 10. This is going to be 350, 350, and it's an average velocity meters per 350, meters per minute. And we are done.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-solved-exams
" -  So I am here at desmos.com, which is an online graphing calculator, and the goal of this video is to explore how shifts in functions happen. How do things shift to the right or left or how do they shift up and down? And what we're going to start off doing is just graph a plain vanilla function, f of x is equal to x squared. That looks as we would expect it to look, but now let's think about how we can shift it up or down. Well one thought is, well, to shift it up, we just have to make the value of f of x higher so we can add a value, and that does look like it shifted it up by one. Whatever f of x was before, we're now adding one to it so it shifts the graph up by one, that's pretty intuitive. If we subtract one, or actually, let's subtract three. Notice, it shifted it down. The vertex was right over here at zero, zero. Now it is at zero, negative three, so it shifted it down. And we can set up a slider here to make that a little bit clearer, so if I just replace this with, if I just replace this with the variable k, then let me delete this little thing here, that little subscript thing that happened. Then we can add a slider k here, and this is just allowing us to set what k is equal to, so here, k is equal to one, so this is x squared plus one, and notice, we have shifted up, and if we increase the value of k, notice how it shifts the graph up, and as we decrease the value of k, if k is zero, we're back where our vertex is right at the origin, and as we decrease the value of k, it shifts our graph down. And that's pretty intuitive, 'cause we're adding or subtracting that amount to x squared so it changes, we could say the y value, it shifts it up or down. But how do we shift to the left or to the right? So what's interesting here is to shift to the left or the right, we can replace our x with an x minus something, so let's see how that might work. So I'm gonna replace our x with an x minus, let's replace it with an x minus one. What do you think is going to happen? Do you think that's going to shift it one to the right or one to the left? So let's just put the one in. Well, that's interesting. Before, our vertex was at zero, zero. Now our vertex is at one, zero. So by replacing our x with an x minus one, we actually shifted one to the right. Now why does that make sense? Well, one way to think about it, before we put this x, before we replaced our x with an x minus one, the vertex was when we were squaring zero. Now, in order to square zero, squaring zero happens when x is equal to one. When x is equal to one, you do one minus one, you get zero, and then that's when you are squaring zero. So it makes sense that you have a similar behavior of the graph at the vertex now when x equals one as before you had when x equals zero. And to see how this can be generalized, let's put another variable here and let's add a slider for h. And then we can see that when h is zero and k is zero, our function is really then just x squared, and then if h increases, we are replacing our x with x minus a larger value. That's shifting to the right and that is, as h decreases, as it becomes negative, that shifts to the left. Now right here, h is equal to negative five. You typically won't see x minus negative five. You would see that written as x plus five, so if you replace your x's with an x plus five, that actually shifts everything five units to the left. And of course, we can shift both of them together, like this. So here, we're shifting it up, and then we are, we could get back to our neutral horizontal shift and then we can shift it to the right like that. And everything we did just now is with the x squared function as our core function, but you could do it with all sorts of functions. You could do it with an absolute value function. Let's do absolute value, that's always a fun one. So instead of squaring all this business, let's have an absolute value here. So I'm gonna put an absolute, whoops. Absolute value, and there you have it. You can start at, let me make both of these variables equal to zero, so that would just be the graph of f of x is equal to the absolute value of x. But let's say you wanted to shift it so that this point right over here that's at the origin is at the point negative five, negative five, which is right over there. So what you would do is you would replace your x with x plus five, or you would make this h variable to negative five right over here, 'cause notice, if you replace your h with a negative five, inside the absolute value, you would have an x plus five, and then if you want to shift it down, you just reduce the value of k, and if you want to shift it down by five, you reduce it by five, and you could get something like that. So I encourage you, go to desmos.com. Try this out for yourself, and really play around with these functions to give yourself an intuition of how things and why things shift up or down when you add a constant, and why things shift to the left or the right when you replace your x's with an x minus, in this case, an x minus h, but it really could be x minus some type of a constant.",math_algebra2_transformations
" -  So we've already been able to explore a lot with our little thought experiment where I am floating in space. I'm at the center of my frame of reference, and right at time equals zero in my frame of reference, a friend comes in a spaceship passing me by with a velocity v, I'll say the magnitude is v, and it's going in the positive x direction. We're just going to focus, and we have been focusing, just on the x dimension for simplicity. And we've thought about reconciling space and time in my frame of reference relative to her frame of reference. The conundrum that we've faced in previous videos is how do we reconcile that the speed of light is always going to be the same in every frame of reference? And to reconcile them, we had to essentially come up with the idea of spacetime. I should say it even faster, spacetime. Spacetime, let me write it out, spacetime. And the first time I heard about spacetime, I assumed that people were just talking about space and time as independent things and just plotting your point in space and time. But when people talk about spacetime, they're really talking about this continuum of one thing, and we're just talking about different directions in spacetime. They could have called this something else. They could have called this spime, or tace, or stace, or a lot of different things. But this is spacetime, and it's this idea that it's this continuum. And when we started to make spacetime diagrams, we realized in order for the speed of light to be absolute, that time and space weren't as independent of each other as we thought, and they weren't as absolute as we thought. And we constructed these Minkowsky spacetime diagrams for each of our frames of reference. So my frame of reference, the spacetime diagram, is here in white, and for my friend's frame of reference, her spacetime diagram is here in this blue color. The angle formed between these axes, between the x and the x prime axis and the ct and the ct prime axis, this angle alpha here, this is going to be dependent on her relative velocity in my frame of reference. So if her velocity is v, or the magnitude of her velocity is v in my frame of reference, this angle we've already seen is going to be the inverse tangent or the arctangent of the ratio between her relative velocity and the speed of light. So this is going to be equal to the inverse tangent of v over c. So the faster she goes, these two things are going to start squeezing together, and if somehow she were to approach the speed of light, they would both approach a 45 degree angle and actually start to coincide if they were actually able to approach the speed of light. And that's all interesting already, this idea that space and time are not as independent, that it's all a continuum called spacetime, but some of you have probably said, well, I want to deal with some more tangible numbers here. For example, if this event right over here in spacetime, we can think about it from my frame of reference, and we can think about it from her frame of reference. In my frame of reference, I would view the coordinates here. This coordinate would be x, and this coordinate right over here would be ct. We had a whole video on why we think of time in terms of ct. The units here literally would be meters. We could think of it as light-meters if we like. So that would be the coordinates in my frame of reference. Well, what would be the coordinates in her frame of reference? Well, we've already thought about how to read these Minkowski spacetime diagrams. To find her x prime coordinate, we would just go parallel to the ct prime axis. So that would be the x prime coordinate in her frame of reference. And to figure out the ct prime coordinate, we would just go parallel to the x prime axis. So this would be the ct prime coordinate. Now how do you actually go in between, transform, from x to x prime and from ct to ct prime? And to do that, we're going to introduce in this video the Lorentz transformations. And what they do is they allow us to do exactly what we just needed to do. They'll allow us to go from x, ct to x prime and ct prime. And to help us think about it, I'm going to introduce some variables, and hopefully it will show the symmetry of the Lorentz transformations. You might see them written in other ways in other sources, and we'll reconcile all of those in the future. But the Lorentz transformations, we'll start with what we call the Lorentz factor because this shows up a lot in the transformation. So I'll just define this ahead of time. So the Lorentz factor, denoted by the Greek letter gamma, lowercase gamma, it is equal to one over the square root of one minus v squared over c squared. Now sometimes you might even see it written like, well, I'll write it another way. Sometimes you might see it written as gamma, let me do it in that same color, same reddish color, gamma is equal to one over the square root of one minus beta squared. You might say, well, what is beta? Well, beta is another variable that shows up a lot when we're thinking about special relativity. And beta is just the ratio between the relative velocity, her relative velocity in my frame of reference, and the speed of light. It shows up a lot, even this angle alpha here, we could have said this is the inverse tangent of beta. This becomes a little bit simpler when you write the Lorentz factor. And when we look at the actual transformation between the coordinates, we'll see that beta becomes useful again, at least the way I like to write it. So if we want to think about what x prime is going to be, so we can write x prime is going to be equal to the Lorentz factor, let me do it in that red color, is going to be equal to the Lorentz factor times x minus, and now we're going to say beta times ct, and ct prime is going to be equal to the Lorentz factor gamma, let me do that same color again, switching colors is sometimes difficult, gamma times, and we'll see it's just the other way around. It is going to be c, let me do it in that green color, ct minus, you might even guess what I'm about to write based on the symmetry that we see here, ct minus beta times x. And I really want you to appreciate this because it really shows that space and time are really just different directions in the spacetime and there's a nice symmetry to them right over here. Notice we have an x and we have an x. We have a ct and we have a ct. So when we're thinking about x prime, it's x minus beta times ct, and we're scaling it by the Lorentz factor, and then when we're thinking about time, well we do it the other way around. We're still scaled by the Lorentz factor, but now it is ct minus beta times x. Now this might all seem like Greek to you, and we actually are using Greek letters, but in the next video, I'll actually use some sample numbers here, and you'll see that evaluating these is just a little bit of straightforward algebra.",science_physics_special-relativity
" -  I have an interesting set up over here. I have a magnetic field that is constant, and it's going straight out of the surface of this loop. The magnitude of the magnetic field at any point of the surface is going to be 'B'. What's interesting here is this loop that we have, This right part of the loop is movable. You can imagine it's a cylinder that can roll to the right, and the magnitude of it's velocity, we're going to say is lowercase 'v'. And this cylinder, lets say it has length 'L' Given that, you can see that we're going to have a change in magnetic flux. Why are we gonna have a change in magnetic flux, or a change in magnetic flux through the surface? Well if this thing is moving to the right, when it's speed is 'v' it can be any units, meters per second, or whatever it is. Even though the magnetic field itself is constant, you're actually going to be changing the area, the area that is, I guess you could, contained by this loop, and so that is going to give us a change in flux And if you have a change in flux that is going to induce an electromotive force, or it's going to induce a voltage in this loop which will cause a current to flow. Let's think about what that electromotive force that's going to be induced is going to be. I'm just gonna rewrite Faraday's law right over here. Faradays law: negative 'N' times our change in flux, and we're talking about our change in flux over change in, let me write that a little bit neater, our change in flux over change in time. The 'N' is the number of loops we're talking about. So in this case, 'N' is just going to be one and the negative, I've already complained a little bit about in previous videos. This is really just reminding us the math, when you're not using proper vector mathematics, this just reminds us that this 'Emf' is going to cause a current to go through this loop, and the magnetic field that is induced by that current will go against the direction of our change in flux. That's just something to remind us. What we really care about is our change in flux over change in time. What is that going to be? Let me just write it here, our change in flux over change in time. Our change in flux in this case is going to be our change in our, the magnitude of our magnetic field that is going perpendicular to the surface times the area of our surface over our change in time. What is this going to be equal to? 'B' is constant, it's not going to change over the time that we care about. So the change in 'B' times 'A' is really going to be 'B' times our change in area. 'B' times our change in area over how much time goes by. So what is our change in area going to be? Let's say we let delta 't' , let's say delta 't' happens, what is going to be our change in area? Let's let delta 't' go on. If delta 't' goes on, this cylinder, or if we wait for 't' units of time, or if 't' units of time go by, let me do this in another color, I'm gonna use this color right over here. How far will we go after delta 't'? We know the magnitude of our velocity if you multiply the magnitude of your velocity times your change in time, that will give you your distance. Your change in area is going to be the amount of distance it's travelled times the length of the rod, which is just that. Our change in area, which is that area right over there, our change in area over that time is going to be the distance this rod goes. Notice this rod is going in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field that's an important thing to realize. We have our change in area is going to be this dimension which is how far the rod travels times the length of the rod, that's how much area we gain, that's how much our area increases, times the length of the rod, that's our change in area. We can substitute that back over here. This is going to be equal to, we got our 'B', we have our change in time, and our change in area we just said is going to be, Let me just write it this way, I could write is as the length of our rod times the magnitude of our velocity, or our speed times our change in time. Well, change in time divided by change in time, those cancel out. Our change in flux over that time or our average rate of change in flux we see simplifies to the length of our rod times the magnitude of our velocity, or our speed, times the magnitude of the magnetic field that is going perpendicular to the surface. This is something that you will see many times in your physics class, this whole notion of if your rod going in a perpendicular direction to a magnetic field, it induces an electromotive force of 'LvB' This is where it's coming from, it's coming directly from Faraday's law. You can say, okay, if that's happening, what direction is the current going to actually flow in? If the magnetic field isn't changing, but since the area is increasing, the flux is increasing in the upward direction. You can say the flux is increasing in that direction. The current that gets induced, and the magnitude of the current is going to be, based on how much resistance we have, but the current is going to induce a magnetic field that goes against our change in flux. Let's see, if the current went that way, what will happen? I'm going to take my right hand out, put my thumb in that direction, and if I were to loop my fingers around, this would, if we went that way, this would describe, this would induce a magnetic field that goes like this. That actually would enhance the flux going through the, or change in flux, going the same direction of the change in flux, We've already talked about this, would violate the law of conservation of energy. The current's gonna go in the other direction. It's gonna go, in this case is going to go clockwise, because the current is going to induce a magnetic field. Once again, I could take my right hand out, and try to draw my right hand, and we can see now, the direction my fingers go in are that way. Notice we're looking at the inside of the surface, the surface area was increasing the flux in the upward direction, getting more of the magnetic field in the upward direction, being contained in the area. The magnetic field induced by the current that is induced, or that current that's being caused by the electromotive force and the magnitude of the force is going to be dependent on our resistance, that's going to go in the other direction, it's going to go down that way. Or it's going to induce a magnetic field that is gonna go downwards. So the current needs to be going clockwise.",science_in-in-class-12th-physics-india_in-in-electromagnetic-induction
" I've got a 2 by 2 matrix here, and let's just say its entries are a, b, c, and d. And it's composed of two column vectors. We've done this before, let's call this first column v1 and let's call the second column v2. So we can rewrite here. We can say v1 one is equal to ac, and we could write that v2 is equal to bd. And these are both members of r2, and just to have a nice visualization in our head, let's graph these two. Let me draw my axes. That's my vertical axis. That's my horizontal axis. And maybe v1 looks something like this. v1 might look something like that. So that is v1. It's horizontal component will be a, its vertical coordit -- give you this as maybe a position vector, or just how we're drawing it, is c. And then v2, let's just say it looks something like this. Let's say that they're not the same vector. So v2 looks like that. v2, its horizontal coordinate is going to b, and its vertical coordinate is going to be d. Now, what we're going to concern ourselves with in this video is the parallelogram generated by these two guys. What I mean by that is, imagine that these two guys are position vectors that are specifying points on a parallelogram, and then of course the -- or not of course but, the origin is also another point in the parallelogram, so what will be the last point on the parallelogram? Well, you can imagine. A parallelogram, we already have two sides of it, so the other two sides have to be parallel. So one side look like that, parallel to v1 the way I've drawn it, and the other side will look like this. That's our parallelogram. The parallelogram generated by v2 and v1. What we're going to concern ourselves with specifically is the area of the parallelogram generated by v1 and v2. So how do we figure that out? In general, if I have just any parallelogram-- this is kind of a tilted one, but if I just have any parallelogram, let me just draw any parallelogram right there-- the area is just equal to the base-- so that could be the base-- times the height. So it's equal to base -- I'll write capital B since we have a lowercase b there-- base times height. That's what the area of a parallelogram would be. Now what are the base and the height in this situation? Let me write this down. The area of our parallelogram is equal to the base times the height. And actually-- well, let me just write it here. So what is the base here? The base here is going to be the length of our vector v. So this is our base. So this right here is going to be the length of vector v1, the length of this orange vector right here. And what's the height of this parallelogram going to be? We could drop a perpendicular here, and that, the length of this line right here, is going to be our height. So how can we figure out that, you know, we know what v1 is, so we can figure out the base pretty easily. But how can we figure out the height? Well, one thing we can do is, if we can figure out this guy right here, we could use the Pythagorean theorem. Because the length of this vector squared, plus H squared, is going to be equal to the length of v2 squared. So let's see if we can do that. What is this guy? What is this green guy right here? Well if you imagine a line-- let's imagine some line l. So let's say l is a line spanned by v1. Which means you take all of the multiples of v1, and all of the positions that they specify will create a set of points, and that is my line l. So you take all the multiples of v1, you're going to get every point along this line. Just like that. Now if we have l defined that way-- that line right there is l, I don't know if you can see it. Let me do it a little bit better -- and it goes through v1 and it just keeps going over there. What is this green line right there? This green line that we're concerned with, that's the projection onto l of what? Well, we have a perpendicular here, you can imagine the light source coming down-- I don't know if that analogy helps you-- but it's kind of the shadow of v2 onto that line. So it's a projection of v2, of your vector v2 onto l is this green line right there. So, if we want to figure out H, we can just use the Pythagorean theorem. So we can say that the length of H squared-- well I'm just writing H as the length, I'm not even specifying it as a vector. So we could say that H squared, where that is the length of this line, plus the length of this vector squared-- and the length of that vector squared is the length of the projection onto l of v2. I'll do that in a different color. So the length of the projection onto l of v2 squared-- all right? We're just doing the Pythagorean theorem. This squared plus this squared is going to equal that squared. It's going to be equal to the length of v2 squared. That's just the Pythagorean theorem. Nothing fancy there. So how can we simplify? We want to solve for H. And actually, let's just solve for H squared for now because it'll keep things a little bit simpler. So we can say that H squared is equal to this guy, is equal to the length of my vector v2 squared minus the length of the projection squared. So minus -- I'll do that in purple -- minus the length of the projection onto l of v2 squared. Remember, this thing is just this thing right here, we're just doing the Pythagorean theorem. So let's see if we can simplify this, or write it in terms that we understand. So the length of a vector squared, this is just equal to-- let me write it this way-- this is just equal to v2 dot v2. You take a vector, you dot it with itself, and you get the length of that vector squared, we saw that many, many videos ago. And then what is this guy going to be equal to? Well, the projection-- I'll do it over here. The projection onto l of v2 is going to be equal to v2 dot the spanning vector, which is v1. So it's v2 dot v1 over the spanning vector dotted with itself, v1 dot v1. We saw this several videos ago when we learned about projections. And this is just a number right there. And then it's going to be times the spanning vector itself. So times v1. That is what the projection is. So it's going to be this minus the length of the projection squared. What is the length of the projection squared? Well that's this guy dotted with himself. Let me write it this way, let me take it step by step. So this is going to be minus-- I'm want to make sure I can still see that up there so I don't have to rewrite it. The projection is going to be, it looks a little complicated but hopefully things will simplify, v2 dot v1 over v1 dot v1 times-- switch colors-- times the vector-- this is all just going to end up being a number, remember you take dot products, you get numbers-- times the vector v1. And we're going to take the length of that whole thing squared. And all of this is going to be equal to H squared. Once again, just the Pythagorean Theorem. This or this squared, which is the height squared, is equal to your hypotenuse squared, this is your hypotenuse squared, minus the other side squared. This is the other side squared. Looks a little complicated, but it was just a projection of this guy on to that right there. So let's see if we can simplify this a little bit. We're just going to have to break out some algebra or let s can do here. Well actually, not algebra, some linear algebra. So what is this guy? Well this guy is just the dot product of this with itself. So this is just equal to-- we know, I mean any vector, if you take the square of its length, it's just that vector dotted with itself. So this thing, if we are taking the square of this guy's length, it's just equal to this guy dotted with himself. Let me write everything over again. So we get H squared is equal to v2 dot v2, and then minus this guy dotted with himself. So minus v2 dot v1 over v1 dot v1, times the vector v1, dotted with itself. 1Dotted with v2 dot v1-- remember, this green part is 1just a number-- over v1 dot v1 times v1. 1And what is this equal to? 1Let's just simplify this. 1These are just scalar quantities, and we saw that 1the dot product is associative with respect to scalar 1quantities, so we can just change the order here. 1So this is going to be equal to the scalar 1quantity times itself. 1So we could say this is equal to v2 dot v1. 1Let me write it this way. 1V2 dot v1, that's going to be-- and we're going to 1multiply the numerator times itself, v2 dot v1. 1And then all of that over v1 dot v1 times v1 dot v1. 1Remember, I'm just taking these two terms and 1multiplying them by each other. 1I'm just switching the order, and then we know that the 1scalars can be taken out, times these two 1guys dot each other. 1Times v1 dot v1. 1That's what this simplifies to. 1Now this is now a number. 1We had vectors here, but when you take a dot product, you 1just get a number. 1And this number is the same as this number. 1So we can simplify a little bit. 1So we can cross those two guys out, and then we are left with 1that our height squared is equal to this 1expression times itself. 1We have it times itself twice, so it's equal to-- let me 1start over here. 1It's equal to v2 dot v2 minus this guy times itself. 1So v2 dot v1 squared, all of that over just one of these 1guys. v1 dot v1. 1That is what the height squared is. 1Now we have the height squared, we could take the 1square root if we just want to solve for the height. 1But to keep our math simple, we know that area is equal to 1base times height. 1Let's just say what the area squared is equal to. 1Because then both of these terms will get squared. 1So if the area is equal to base times height-- we saw 1that at the beginning of the video-- then the area squared 1is going to be equal to these two guys squared. 1It's going to be equal to base squared times height squared. 1Now what is the base squared? 1Let me do it like this. 1So the base squared-- we already saw, the base of our 1parallelogram is the length of vector v1. 1Now what is the base squared? 1The base squared is going to be the length 1of vector v1 squared. 1Or another way of writing that is v1 dot v1. 1And we already know what the height squared is, it's this 1expression right there. 1Let me write that down. 1The height squared is the height squared right there. 1So what is our area squared going to be? 1Our area squared-- let me go down here where I'll have more 1space-- our area squared is going to be equal to our base 1squared, which is v1 dot v1 times our height squared. 1Let with me write it like this. 1No, I was using the wrong color. 1Times this guy over here. v2 dot v2 minus v2 dot v1 squared 1over v1 dot v1. 1Now what does this simplified to? 1Well, this is just a number, these are all just numbers. 1So if I multiply, if I distribute this out, this is 1equal to what? 1This times this is equal to v1-- let me color code it-- v1 1dot v1 times this guy times v2 dot v2. 1And then when I multiplied this guy times 1that guy, what happens? 1Well I have this guy in the numerator and that guy in the 1denominator, so they cancel out. 1So I'm just left with minus v2 dot v1 squared. 1Now let's remind ourselves what these two vectors were. 1v1 was the vector ac and v2 is the vector bd. 1Let me rewrite it down here so we have it to work with. 1So v1 was equal to the vector ac, and v2 is equal 1to the vector bd. 1So what is v1 dot v1? 1That is equal to a dot a, a times a, a 1squared plus c squared. 1That's this, right there. 1And that's what? v2 dot v2. 1So we're going to have that times v2 dot v2. 1v2 dot v2 is v squared plus d squared. 1And then we're going to have minus v2 dot v1 squared. 1So what's v2 dot v1? 1It's b times a, plus d times c, or a times b plus -- we're 1just dotting these two guys. 1So it's ab plus cd, and then we're squaring it. 1And let's see what this simplifies to. 1Hopefully it simplifies to something. 1Let me switch colors. 1So if we just multiply this out, let me write it here. 1Our area squared is equal to a squared times b squared. 1a squared times d squared, plus c squared times b 1squared, plus c squared times d squared. 1And then minus this guy squared. 1What is that going to be equal to? 1ab squared is a squared, b squared. 1And then I'm going to multiply these guys times each other 1twice, so that's going to be plus 2abcd. 1And then you're going to have a plus c squared, d squared. 1I just foiled this out, that's the best way you 1could think about it. 1And then, if I distribute this negative sign, what do I have? 1Let me rewrite everything. 1It's equal to a squared b squared, plus a squared d 1squared, plus c squared b squared, plus c squared d 1squared, minus a squared b squared, minus 2abcd, minus c 1squared, d squared. 1All I did is, I distributed the minus sign. 1Now it looks like some things will simplify nicely. 1And now remember, all this is equal to our area squared. 1We have a ab squared, we have a minus ab squared. 1They cancel out. 1We have a minus cd squared and a cd squared, 1so they cancel out. 1So all we're left with is that the area of our parallelogram 1squared is equal to a squared d squared minus 2abcd plus c 1squared b squared. 1Now this might look a little bit bizarre to you, but if you 1made a substitution right here, if you said that x is 1equal to ad, and if you said y is equal to cb, then what does 1this become? 1This is equal to x squared minus 2 1times xy plus y squared. 1Right? 1Hopefully you recognize this. 1And this is just the same thing as x minus y squared. 1So, if this is our substitutions we made-- I did 1this just so you can visualize this a little bit better. 1So we have our area squared is equal to x minus y squared or 1ad minus cb, or let me write it, bc squared. 1That's what the area of our parallelogram squared is. 1And if you don't quite understand what I did here, I 1just made these substitutions so you can 1recognize it better. 1But just understand that this is the same thing as this. 1If you want, you can just multiply this guy out and 1you'll get that right there. 1But what is this? 1What is this thing right here? 1It's the determit. 1This is the determit of our original matrix. 1Well, I called that matrix A and then I used A again for 1area, so let me write it this way. 1Area squared -- let me write it like this. 1Area squared is equal to ad minus bc squared. 1So this is area, these A's are all area. 1But what is this? 1This is the determit of my matrix. 1That is the determit of my matrix A, my original matrix 1that I started the problem with, which is equal to the 1determit of abcd. 1Right? 1The determit of this is ad minus bc, by definition. 1So your area-- this is exciting! 1So the area of your parallelogram squared is equal 2to the determit of the matrix whose column vectors 2construct that parallelogram. 2Is equal to the determit of your matrix squared. 2Or if you take the square root of both sides, you get the 2area is equal to the absolute value of the determit of A. 2Which is a pretty neat outcome, especially 2considering how much hairy algebra we had to go through. 2Let's go back all the way over here, go back to the drawing. 2So if we want to figure out the area of this parallelogram 2right here, that is defined, or that is created, by the two 2column vectors of a matrix, we literally just have to find 2the determit of the matrix. 2The area of this is equal to the absolute value of the 2determit of A. 2And you have to do that because 2this might be negative. 2You can imagine if you swapped these guys around, if you 2swapped some of the rows, this guy would be negative, but you 2can 't have a negative area. 2And it wouldn't really change the definition, it really 2wouldn't change what spanned. 2If you switched v1 and v2, you're still spanning the same 2parallelogram, you just might get the negative of the 2determit. 2But that is a really neat outcome. 2And you know, when you first learned determits in 2school-- I mean, we learned the first motivation for a 2determit was this idea of when we take the inverse of a 22 by 2, this thing shows up in the denominator and we call 2that the determit. 2But now there's this other interpretation here. 2There's actually the area of the parallelogram created by 2the column vectors of this matrix.",math_in-in-grade-12-ncert_in-in-determinants
" In this video, I want to talk about action potential patterns. The information from inputs to a neuron is converted to the size, duration, and direction of graded membrane potentials in the dendrites and the soma, so that a small excitatory input to a dendrite, say, usually causes a small excitatory graded potential, also called a depolarization. And a larger excitatory input usually causes a larger excitatory potential. And the same goes for inhibitory inputs. A small inhibitory input usually causes a small hyperpolarization or inhibitory potential. And a larger inhibitory input usually causes a larger hyperpolarization or inhibitory potential. Neurons process that information by summation of the graded potentials at the trigger zone to determine if an action potential will be fired down the axon. Action potentials, however, are consistently the same size and duration for any given neuron, so that the information contained in the graded potentials is, instead, converted into a temporal pattern or a timing of action potentials being fired down the axon. So here I've drawn some lines to just represent time. And we'll look at the temporal patterns or the timing of action potentials that can happen to transmit different kinds of information down the axons of different types of neurons. Some neurons fire no action potentials until there is sufficient excitatory inputs. And then the size and duration of depolarization over threshold is converted into the frequency and duration of a series, which is also called a train of action potentials. So let's say this is one of these neurons that doesn't fire any action potentials at rest. But then if it gets sufficient excitatory input to depolarize the trigger zone over threshold right here, then we see a little train of action potentials. And I'll just write out one little line here that's often called a spike to represent one action potential. And then this neuron will fire a little train, a little series of action potentials for as long as that depolarization is over the threshold potential. And then when the depolarization ends or when it dips below the threshold at the trigger zone, the train of action potential stops, and then the neuron is quiet again. It's not firing any action potentials. So this is a very common method used by lots of neurons in the nervous system. For example, the motor neurons that synapse on skeletal muscle, they tend to fire very few or no action potentials until they're excited enough. And then they'll fire a train of action potentials, and then they're quiet again. Other neurons, however, actually fire action potentials at a regular rate in the absence of any input. And the reason they do this is that they have differences in their leak channels and/or their voltage-gated channels that actually spontaneously depolarize the membrane to threshold at a regular interval, which is very similar to how the pacemaker cells in the heart function. And with these types of neurons, excitatory input will cause them to fire action potentials more frequently during the period of time that they're excited. And then when that excitation goes away, they go back to their regular rate of firing. And inhibitory input will have the opposite effect. That will slow down their firing during the period of inhibition. And then when that goes away, they go back to their regular rate of firing again. And there are even more complicated neurons that, in the absence of input, fire little bursts of action potentials, followed by a little space. And then they have another regular little burst of action potentials. With these types of neurons, excitatory input can cause the little bursts to happen more frequently. It can cause changes within the burst, and it can cause changes to the spacing between the bursts. But then when the input goes away, they go back to their regular bursts. And the opposite happens with inhibitory input. That can slow down the frequency of these bursts. The advantage of these sorts of systems, where the neurons fire at regular rates spontaneously or in bursts, is that information passed along to the target cells can be fine-tuned in either direction, because with a neuron like this that's quiet at rest, the information can only go in one direction. It can only go from no action potentials being fired to trains of action potentials of different frequencies and durations. But if there's more inhibitory input to these types of neurons, that information can't be passed along. But with these types of neurons, information from both excitatory and inhibitory inputs can be passed along in a more fine-grained fashion. The different temporal patterns of action potentials are then converted to the amounts and temporal patterns of neurotransmitter release at the synapse. And target cells can be set up a lot of different ways to respond to these temporal patterns and amounts of neurotransmitter release.",science_health-and-medicine_nervous-system-and-sensory-infor
" -  In this video, we're going to talk about regression lines, but it's not gonna be the first time we're talking about regression lines. And so if the idea of a regression is foreign to you, I encourage you to watch the introductory videos on it. Here we're gonna think about how we can make inferences from a regression line. And so if the idea of statistical inference is new to you or hypothesis testing, once again, watch those videos as well. But let's say we think there's a positive association between shoe size and height. And so what we might want to do is we could, here on the horizontal axis, that is shoe size. Our sizes could go size one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, and it could keep going up from there. And then, on this height, or on this axis, our y-axis, this would be height, so one foot, two feet, three feet, four feet, five feet, six feet, seven feet. And then you could, to see if there's an association, you might take a sample. Let's say you take a random sample of 20 people from the population. And in future videos, we'll talk about the conditions necessary for making appropriate inferences. Let's say those 20 people are these 20 data points. So there's a young child, and maybe there's a grown adult, with bigger feet and who's taller. And then three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and so you have these 20 data points. And then what you're likely to do is input them into a computer. You could do it by hand, but we have computers now to do that for us usually. And the computer could try to fit a regression line. And there's many techniques for doing it, but one typical technique is to try to overall minimize the squared distance between these points and that line. And this regression line will have an equation, as any line would have. And we tend to show that as saying y hat, this hat tells us that this is a regression line, is equal to the y-intercept, a plus the slope times our x variable. So this right over here would be a. Now, to be clear, if you took another sample, you might get different results here. In fact, let's call this y sub one for our first sample, a sub one, b sub one, and this is a sub one. If you were to take another sample of 20 folks, so let's do that. Maybe you get one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and then you tried to fit a line to that, that line might look something like this. It might have a slightly different y-intercept and a slightly different slope. So we could call that, for the second sample, y sub two or y hat sub two is equal to a sub two plus b sub two times x. And so every time you take a sample, you are likely to get different results for these values, which are essentially statistics. Remember, statistics are things that we can get from samples, and we're trying to estimate true population parameters. Well, what would be the true population parameters we're trying to estimate? Well, imagine a world, imagine a world here, that you are able to find out the true linear relationship, or maybe there is some true linear relationship between shoe size and height. You could get it if theoretically you could measure every human being on the planet. And depending what you define as a population, it could be all living people or all people who will ever live. This isn't practical, but let's just say that you actually could. And you would have billions of data points here for the true population. And then if you were to fit a regression line to that, you could view this as the true population regression line. And so that would be y hat is equal to, and to make it clear that here, the y-intercept and the slope, this would be the true population parameters. Instead of saying a, we say alpha. And instead of saying b, we say beta times x. But it's very hard to come up exactly with what alpha and beta are, and so that's why we estimate it with a's and b's based on a sample. Now, what's interesting, with this in mind, is we can start to make inferences based on our sample. So we know that, for example, b sub two is unlikely to be exactly beta. But how confident can we be that there is at least a positive linear relationship or a nonzero linear relationship? Or can we create a confidence interval around this statistic in order to have a good sense of where the true parameter might actually be? And the simple answer is yes. And to do so, we'll use the same exact ideas that we did when we made inferences based on proportions or based on means. The way that you can make an inference, for example, for your true population slope of your regression line, say, okay, I took a sample, I got this slope right over here, so I'll just call that b two, and then I could create a confidence interval around that. And so that confidence interval is going to be based on some critical value times, ideally, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of your sample statistic. In this case, it would be the sample regression line slope. But because we don't know exactly what this is, we can't figure out precisely what this is going to be from a sample, we are going to estimate it with what's known as the standard error of the statistic. And we'll go into more depth in this in future videos. And since we're estimating here, we're going to use a critical t-value here, which we have studied before. And so based on your confidence level you want to have, let's say it's 95%, based on the degrees of freedom, which we'll see will come out of how many data points we have, we can figure this out. And from our sample, we can figure this out, and we can figure this out. And then we would have constructed a confidence interval. We'll also see that you could do hypothesis testing here. You could say, hey, let's set up a null hypothesis, and the null hypothesis is going to be that there is no nonzero linear relationship or that the true population slope of the regression line or slope of the population regression line is equal to zero and that the alternative hypothesis is that the true relationship could either be greater than zero, it's a positive linear relationship, or that it's just nonzero. And then what you could do is, assuming this, you could see what's the probability of getting a statistic that is at least this extreme or more extreme? And if that's below some threshold, you might reject the null hypothesis, which would suggest the alternative. So this and this are things that we have done before where you're creating a confidence interval around a statistic or you're doing hypothesis testing, making assumptions about a true parameter. The only difference here is that the parameter that we're trying to estimate are going to be the parameters for a theoretical population regression line, and we're going to do that using sample statistics for a sample regression line.",math_ap-statistics_inference-slope-linear-regression
" Let's compare the fraction 4/7 to the fraction 5/7. And what I want you to do right now is to pause this video and think about which of these fractions represents a larger quantity. I'm assuming you've had a go at it, and the one thing that might jump out at you is that they both have the same bottom number, which we call the denominator. They both have a denominator of 7. So one way to think about it is this is literally 4 sevenths. This is literally 5 sevenths. So we could rewrite 4/7 as literally 4 times 1/7. And we can rewrite 5/7 as literally 5 times 1/7. It's 5/7. So now if I have 4 of something versus 5 of something, which is going to be a larger quantity? Well, clearly 5 of this 1/7 is going to be more. So 4/7 is smaller, 5/7 is larger. And so what we can do is we can write a less than symbol. The way that I remember less than and greater than, is that the point, the small side of the symbol, always is on the same side as the smaller number. So this could be read as 4/7 is less than 5/7, or that 4 times 1/7 is less than 5 times 1/7. Now, let's do another scenario, but instead of having the same denominator, let's have the same numerator. So let's say we want to compare 3/4 versus-- let's say versus 3/9. Which of these two fractions is a larger number? And once again, pause the video and try to think about it on your own. Well, as we mentioned, we don't have the same denominator here. We have the same top number instead. Here is the same bottom number, same denominator. Here we're going to have the same numerator. We have the 3 right over there. And we could view 3/4 as literally 3 times 1/4. And we could view 3/9 as literally 3 times 1/9. So we have 3/4 and we have 3/9. So we really just have to about what's larger, a fourth or a ninth? Well, think about if you start with a whole-- think about starting with a whole like this. And let me make a whole right over here, so the same sized whole. A fourth is literally taking the whole and dividing it into 4 pieces. While a ninth is taking the whole and dividing it into 9. 9 equal sections, I could say. So let's divide this into 4 equal sections. So my best attempt to hand draw equal sections. So that's 2 equal sections and then that looks pretty close to 4 equal sections. So that right over there is 1/4. And let me draw ninths here. So let me first split this into 3 equal sections. So those would be third. And then split each of those into 3 equal sections. So this is my best attempt at that, at hand drawing 9 equal sections, splitting the whole into 9 equal sections. So when you see here-- and you might have already realized this-- if you divide something into 4 equal sections, each section is going to be bigger than if you divide it into 9 equal sections. A ninth is smaller than a fourth. A ninth is smaller than 1/4. So 3/9 is going to be smaller than 3/4. So once again, when you want to do less than or greater than, you want to put the point, the small side of the symbol, on the same side as the smaller number. So it would look like this. And this is the greater than symbol, because what you have on the left is the larger number. 3/4 is greater than 3/9. And if you actually wanted to represent not just 1/4 and 1/9, we could actually color it in. 3 times one fourth, well that's 1, 2, 3. While 3 times 1/9, or 3/9, is 1, 2, 3. And when you look at it that way, it's pretty clear. But the important thing to realize is, is that when the denominator is larger, you're dividing the whole into more pieces so each piece will be smaller. So making the denominator larger makes the fraction smaller. Making the numerator larger makes the fraction larger.",math_in-in-class-6-math-india-icse_in-in-6-fractions-icse
" I think it's very important to have as many ways as possible to view a certain type of problem, so I want to introduce you to a different way. Some people might have taught this first, but the way I taught it in the first integral video is kind of the way that I always think about when I do the problems. But sometimes, it's more useful to think about it the way I'm about to show you, and maybe you won't see the difference, or maybe you'll say, oh, Sal, those are just the exact same thing. Someone actually emailed me and told me that I should make it so I can scroll things, and I said, oh, that's not too hard to do. So I just did that, and I scrolled my drawing. But anyway, let's say we have a surface in 3 dimensions. It's a function of x and y. You give me a coordinate down here, and I'll tell you how high the surface is at that point. And we want to figure out the volume under that surface. So. We can very easily figure out the volume of a very small column underneath the surface. So this whole volume is what we're trying to figure out, right, between the dotted lines. I think you can see it. You have some experience visualizing this right now. So let's say that I have a little area here. We could call that da. Let me see if I can draw this. Let's say we have a little area down here, a little square in the x-y plane. And it's, depending on how you view it, this side of it is dx, its length is dx, and the height, you could say, on that side, is dy. Right? Because it's a little small change in y there, and it's a little small change in x here. And its area, the area of this little square, is going to be dx times dy. And if we wanted to figure out the volume of the solid between this little area and the surface, we could just multiply this area times the function. Right? Because the height at this point is going to be the value of the function, roughly, at this point. Right? This is going to be an approximation, and then we're going to take an infinite sum. I think you know where this is going. But let me do that. Let me at least draw the little column that I want to show you. So that's one end of it, that's another end of it, that's the front end of it, that's the other end of it. So we have a little figure that looks something like that. A little column, right? It intersects the top of the surface. And the volume of this column, not too difficult. It's going to be this little area down here, which is, we could call that da. Sometimes written like that. da. It's a little area. And we're going to multiply that area times the height of this column, and that's the function at that point. So it's f of x and y. And of course, we could have also written it as, this da is just dx times dy, or dy times dx. I'm going to write it in every different way. So we could also have written this as f of xy times dx times dy. And of course, since multiplication is associative, I could have also written it as f of xy times dy dx. These are all equivalent, and these all represent the volume of this column, that's the between this little area here and the surface. So now, if we wanted to figure out the volume of the entire surface, we have a couple of things we could do. We could add up all of the volumes in the x-direction, between the lower x-bound and the upper x-bound, and then we'd have kind of a thin sheet, although it will already have some depth, because we're not adding up just the x's. There's also a dy back there. So we would have a volume of a figure that would extend from the lower x all the way to the upper x, go back dy, and come back here. If we wanted to sum up all the dx's. And if we wanted to do that, which expression would we use? Well, we would be summing with respect to x first, so we could use this expression, right? And actually, we could write it here, but it just becomes confusing. If we're summing with respect to x, but we have the dy written here first. It's really not incorrect, but it just becomes a little ambiguous, are we summing with respect to x or y. But here, we could say, OK. If we want to sum up all the dx's first, let's do that. We're taking the sum with respect to x, and let me, I'm going to write down the actual, normally I just write numbers here, but I'm going to say, well, the lower bound here is x is equal to a, and the upper bound here is x is equal to b. And that'll give us the volume of, you could imagine a sheet with depth, right? The sheet is going to be parallel to the x-axis, right? And then once we have that sheet, in my video, I think that's the newspaper people trying to sell me something. Anyway. So once we have the sheet, I'll try to draw it here, too, I don't want to get this picture too muddied up, but once we have that sheet, then we can integrate those, we can add up the dy's, right? Because this width right here is still dy. We could add up of all the different dy's, and we would have the volume of the whole figure. So once we take this sum, then we could take this sum. Where y is going from it's bottom, which we said with c, from y is equal to c to y's upper bound, to y is equal to d. Fair enough. And then, once we evaluate this whole thing, we have the volume of this solid, or the volume under the surface. Now we could have gone the other way. I know this gets a little bit messy, but I think you get what I'm saying. Let's start with that little da we had originally. Instead of going this way, instead of summing up the dx's and getting this sheet, let's sum up the dy's first, right? So we could take, we're summing in the y-direction first. We would get a sheet that's parallel to the y-axis, now. So the top of the sheet would look something like that. So if we're coming the dy's first, we would take the sum, we would take the integral with respect to y, and it would be, the lower bound would be y is equal to c, and the upper bound is y is equal to d. And then we would have that sheet with a little depth, the depth is dx, and then we could take the sum of all of those, sorry, my throat is dry. I just had a bunch of almonds to get power to be able to record these videos. But once I have one of these sheets, and if I want to sum up all of the x's, then I could take the infinite sum of infinitely small columns, or in this view, sheets, infinitely small depths, and the lower bound is x is equal to a, and the upper bound is x is equal to b. And once again, I would have the volume of the figure. And all I showed you here is that there's two ways of doing the order of integration. Now, another way of saying this, if this little original square was da, and this is a shorthand that you'll see all the time, especially in physics textbooks, is that we are integrating along the domain, right? Because the x-y plane here is our domain. So we're going to do a double integral, a two-dimensional integral, we're saying that the domain here is two-dimensional, and we're going to take that over f of x and y times da. And the reason why I want to show you this, is you see this in physics books all the time. I don't think it's a great thing to do. Because it is a shorthand, and maybe it looks simpler, but for me, whenever I see something that I don't know how to compute or that's not obvious for me to know how to compute, it actually is more confusing. So I wanted to just show you that what you see in this physics book, when someone writes this, it's the exact same thing as this or this. The da could either be dx times dy, or it could either be dy times dx, and when they do this double integral over domain, that's the same thing is just adding up all of these squares. Where we do it here, we're very ordered about it, right? We go in the x-direction, and then we add all of those up in the y-direction, and we get the entire volume. Or we could go the other way around. When we say that we're just taking the double integral, first of all, that tells us we're doing it in two dimensions, over a domain, that leaves it a little bit ambiguous in terms of how we're going to sum up all of the da's. And they do it intentionally in physics books, because you don't have to do it using Cartesian coordinates, using x's and y's. You can do it in polar coordinates, you could do it a ton of different ways. But I just wanted to show you, this is another way to having an intuition of the volume under a surface. And these are the exact same things as this type of notation that you might see in a physics book. Sometimes they won't write a domain, sometimes they'd write over a surface. And we'll later do those integrals. Here the surface is easy, it's a flat plane, but sometimes it'll end up being a curve or something like that. But anyway, I'm almost out of time. I will see you in the next video.",math_multivariable-calculus_integrating-multivariable-functions
" -  So before we sort of jump into what strokes are, let me just sort of orient you to this, to what we're looking at here. So this is a side view of a person. And we can see the contents of their skull. So let's do some labeling here. We've got the skull here, and obviously, the skull protects the brain. We have the cerebrum, the most obvious part of the brain, in pink. We have the cerebellum down here, and we have the brain stem. Now, in terms of vessels, in terms of blood vessels, all of the blue that you see here, these are all veins. These are veins that drain the brain. And now let's label some arteries. So here in front, we have the internal carotid artery. And remember, we're only looking at the left side here. So we can only see the left one. And here, sort of running up inside the vertebrae, we have the vertebral artery. Now it gets a little bit tricky here. This is the basilar artery. This here is the middle cerebral artery. I'll call it the MCA. Here we have the posterior cerebral artery. We'll call that the PCA. And in front here, we have the ACA, or the anterior cerebral artery. And you can sort of see the Circle of Willis is formed right there. All right. So let's jump into it. So all those vessels we just talked about, that's your blood supply to your brain. And if you lose some or all of that blood supply to your brain, then you lose some or all brain function. So the loss of some blood supply causing the loss of brain function, that's a stroke. So there's two main ways to disturb this blood supply. The most common type of disturbance is where you get stoppage of blood flow to a part of your brain. So let me draw this out for you. Let's say that this bit of the anterior cerebral artery is blocked off. This means that blood won't be able to go from this previous part of the ACA over to this next part of the ACA. And if blood can't get through, then the brain tissue downstream, that depends on that blood for its oxygen needs, that brain tissue would start to get injured and start to die off. And the second kind of disturbance, once that's not as common, but still really, really serious, is where one of the blood vessels of your cerebral circulation, where one of the blood vessels ruptures. Let's say that this bit of the ACA, right at the junction between the ACA and the anterior communicating artery, started to balloon out. Right? It started to form an aneurysm. Well, eventually, that aneurysm could rupture. And if it ruptured, you'd start leaking blood out of your cerebral circulation and into the space around your brain. So if that happens, there's two major consequences. First, because you're leaking blood out of your cerebral circulation, these downstream parts of, say, your anterior cerebral artery here, obviously won't be getting any blood. So again, this downstream brain tissue is gonna have a lack of oxygen around. So it'll start to get damaged. Also, the blood will start to collect and sort of push on your brain tissue and cause damage to your brain that way. So those are really the two types of stroke. You can get stoppage of blood flow to an area, which is also called an ischemic stroke, ""ischemic"" referring to an environment, the cellular environment where there's not enough oxygen, or you can get this rupture of a vessel that we saw earlier. And that's also called a hemorrhagic stroke. Hemorrhagic. And ""hemorrhagic"" refers to, sort of, a sudden torrential bleeding outburst. So, ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. But regardless of whether you have an ischemic stroke or a hemorrhagic stroke, either way your brain cells are gonna start to malfunction after about three minutes or so. And that's because they have now a lack of oxygen, right? Because they're not getting proper blood flow, not getting proper blood supply, and they're not getting enough glucose. And they need glucose in your bloodstream to function properly, to carry out their complicated functions. So what do you think might happen if a part of your brain just sort of stopped working, started to malfunction? Well, intuitively, you might start to think, ""Well, hey, if a part of my brain starts malfunctioning, ""I might lose those abilities ""that that part of the brain performs,"" right? So let's look at a few examples here. So let's say we get a clot. This is a clot here. Let's say we get one in the middle cerebral artery. Well, if we get a clot here, then that means that blood isn't gonna be able to get through the MCA, right? Here's blood in the MCA. All of a sudden, we're gonna lose the abilities that the downstream parts of the brain perform, at least temporarily. Now, the middle cerebral artery's pretty important. It actually supplies blood to two really important areas of the brain, one called Broca's area, on the outside of the brain, and one called Wernicke's area, or Wernicke's area, depending on if you wanna use the true German pronunciation. And these two areas are really, really important in determining your speech, determining how you speak and whether or not you can understand what people are saying to you. So if you get a big clot in your middle cerebral artery, and you happen to stop blood supply to Broca's area and/or Wernicke's area, you're gonna end up with problems with your speech. Now, let's do another example. Let's say you get a clot here, in this little artery coming off the basilar artery. Right? So that runs up your brain stem. Well, there's a lot of special nerves called cranial nerves that originate on your brain stem and sort of go their separate ways from there. And some of them are involved in controlling your facial muscles. And if these neurons lose oxygen, it means that you might start to have the edges of your mouth droop, it means that your eyelids might start to droop, basically, you might not be able to use some of the muscles of your face. So what exactly determines how bad a stroke is? Well, two things: where in the brain it happens, and how much brain tissue is actually damaged. And what determines that? Well, that's determined by which blood vessels are involved. For example, if you get a big clot right about here, then you're not gonna allow blood to your brain stem. So your brain stem would start to die off, and that would be really, really bad because your brain stem is really responsible for keeping your alive. Your brain stem has all of the regulatory centers that control your breathing and your heart and a lot of your other vital functions. In contrast, if you got a clot, let's say, in this tiny little vessel here, or in this tiny little vessel right about there, on in this one here, then how much brain injury would you end up with? Well, you'd end up with a little in each small area. And while, ideally, you don't have any brain injury, the sort of functional disability that you'd suffer if you had these small strokes, compared to this really, really big and significant stroke, there'd be a pretty big difference there. So just to reiterate, the severity of the stroke depends on where you get your stroke, right ... So again, you don't wanna have it in your brain stem ... And how much brain area is involved. And is this brain injury irreversible? Well, most of the time, yes. Neurons will start to die after about four minutes without oxygen. So what would cause a stroke to happen? Well, there's some common heart conditions, like atrial fibrillation, where the uppermost chambers of your heart don't contract properly. That often creates blood clots. And then those blood clots, when they, when they get pumped out of your heart, they can travel up to your brain and get stuck in your brain blood vessels, like we saw earlier. Another common heart-related cause is a myocardial infarct, or a heart attack. So when you have a heart attack, a part of your heart wall might start to not contract properly. So when that happens, little blood clots can grow on the heart wall and then be pumped out, up into the brain. Another really common cause, and actually one of the most common causes of stroke, is when you get something called atherosclerosis, or build-up of, sort of, this fatty cholesterol plaque in the walls of your arteries. So let's say that you got some cholesterol build-up in the wall of the artery here, in the internal carotid. Well, as you can imagine, blood is gonna have a really, really hard time getting past this, sort of, massive cholesterol that's stuck in the wall of the artery, right, this atherosclerosis. And these can happen in multiple places in the brain, too. And if you actually have one, you're likely to have another. So you might have one there, and you might have one, say, here, you might have one there. So they're really, really dangerous, atherosclerotic plaques. Now, let me switch gears for a second and talk about something called a TIA, or a transient ischemic attack, also known as a mini-stroke. A TIA is essentially a temporary interruption of blood flow to a part of the brain. So the symptoms, the symptoms of the TIA and the stroke, they're really similar. But the difference is that a TIA doesn't actually destroy brain cells and it doesn't cause permanent disability. So one of the key differences is that a TIA will resolve, it'll kind of go away within 24 hours, whereas, if you have a stroke, if you've had a proper stroke, you may not gain normal function again for weeks or months, 1or maybe even for the rest of your life. 1So let me just quickly show you what this would look like. 1So in a proper stroke, let's say this vessel gets blocked. 1Without treatment, this tissue will die off. 1But in a TIA, you'd get a little clot, 1this area would start to become injured, 1and then the clot would sort of spontaneously 1break up and go away. 1And then, all of a sudden, this brain tissue 1would start to go back to normal again. 1And so, in the vast majority of situations, 1you won't be left with any permanent brain cell death. 1So to finish off, let's just clear up 1a few misconceptions about stroke. 1So there's a common thought 1that strokes are primarily heart-related. 1And, as we saw earlier, the heart's certainly involved 1in some causes of stroke. 1But strictly speaking, strokes are conditions 1related to a mismatch 1between cerebral blood flow supply and demand. 1So it's a cerebral, it's a brain problem. 1There's another common misconception 1that strokes only occur in the elderly. 1And while it's true that about 2/3s of strokes 1happen in the elderly, and people older than 65, 1a pretty significant 1/3 happen in people under 65. 1So strokes can happen in people of varying ages. 1Last, and probably the most important, 1strokes are not unpreventable. 1There's a lot of things you can do 1to reduce your risk of having a stroke, 1such as controlling any high blood pressure 1or stopping smoking.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system-diseases
" -  What I'd like to do in this video is get an intuitive sense for what the derivative with respect to x of sine of x is and what the derivative with respect to x of cosine of x is. And I've graphed y is equal to cosine of x in blue and y is equal to sine of x in red. We're not going to prove what the derivatives are, but we're gonna know what they are, get an intuitive sense and in future videos we'll actually do a proof. So let's start with sine of x. So the derivative can be viewed as the slope of the tangent line. So for example at this point right over here, it looks like the slope of our tangent line should be zero. So our derivative function should be zero at that x value. Similarly, over here, it looks like the derivative is zero. Slope of the tangent line would be zero. So whatever our derivative function is at that x value, it should be equal to zero. If we look right over here on sine of x, it looks like the slope of the tangent line would be pretty close to one. If that is the case, then in our derivative function when x is equal to zero that derivative function should be equal to one. Similarly, over here, it looks like the slope of the tangent line is negative one, which tells us that the derivative function should be hitting the value of negative one at that x value. So you're probably seeing something interesting emerge. Everywhere, while we're trying to plot the slope of the tangent line, it seems to coincide with y is equal to cosine of x. And it is indeed the case that the derivative of sine of x is equal to cosine of x. And you can see that it makes sense, not just at the points we tried, but even in the trends. If you look at sine of x here, the slope is one, but then it becomes less and less and less positive all the way until it becomes zero. Cosine of x, the value of the function is one and it becomes less and less positive all the way until it equals zero. And you could keep doing that type of analysis to feel good about it. In another video we're going to prove this more rigorously. So now let's think about cosine of x. So cosine of x, right over here, the slope of the tangent line looks like it is zero. And so it's derivative function needs to be zero at that point. So, hey, maybe it's sine of x. Let's keep trying this. So over here, cosine of x, it looks like the slope of the tangent line is negative one and so we would want the derivative to go through that point right over there. All right this is starting to seem, it doesn't seem like the derivative of cosine of x could be sine of x. In fact, this is the opposite of what sine of x is doing. Sine of x is at one, not negative one at that point. But that's an interesting theory, maybe the derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x. So let's plot that. So this does seem to coincide. The derivative of cosine of x here looks like negative one, the slope of a tangent line and negative sign of this x value is negative one. Over here the derivative of cosine of x looks like it is zero and negative sine of x is indeed zero. So it actually turns out that it is the case, that the derivative of cosine of x is negative sine of x. So these are really good to know. These are kind of fundamental trigonometric derivatives to know. We'll be able to derive other things for them. And hopefully this video gives you a good intuitive sense of why this is true. And in future videos, we will prove it rigorously.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-derivative-rules
" -  In other videos we have already looked at production possibility curves and output tables in order to calculate opportunity costs of producing a certain product in a certain country. And then we used that to think about comparative advantage. We're going to do something very similar in this video, but instead of thinking about, or instead of starting with output, we're gonna start with input. So right over here we have a table that shows us the worker hours per item per country. So, instead of this being an output table where we say in a given country, how much of, say, toy cars can a worker in country A produce per day? Here we're saying, how many hours does a worker in country A take to produce A toy car? In country A it is two hours. That labor, that two hours of labor, this is the input. So we're not counting the number of cars per day here. We're saying how many hours per car, A, we need to put in to produce it. Similarly, we have the input required in country A to produce a belt. One hour of worker time. In country B, four hours of worker time produces a toy car. And in country B, three hours of worker time produces a belt. So what we're gonna do next is convert this into the world that you might be more familiar with, of thinking in an output world. And to do that, we'll just assume that there are eight working hours per day in either country. And so from this, can we construct an output table? Let me put this right over here. Output table, where once again we're gonna think about the output in country A. We're gonna think about the output in country B. And this is going to be in how many units of that product can a worker produce per day in each of those countries? So once again, we're gonna have toy cars in this row, and we're going to have belts in this row. And let me just draw some lines so it's clear that we're dealing with a table here. So there we go. Then one more column. And so, see if you can fill these in. So how many toy cars per worker per day can we produce in country A? Then think about it for belts. Then think about both of them for country B. Pause the video and try to figure that out. Alright, now let's think about how many toy cars per worker per day. Let me make it very clear. We're thinking per worker per day here. Because if we can fill out this output table from this, I guess you could call this an input table, then we can think about opportunity cost in the traditional way. And then we could think about in which country do we have a comparative advantage? So, let's see. Toy cars in country A. If it takes two hours to produce one toy car in country A, and if you're working, if the average, or if the worker is working eight hours per day, well then, a worker can produce four cars. Four cars times two hours is eight hours. So, an average worker per day in country A can produce four toy cars. Let me write than in that red color. Four toy cars. I just took eight hours and I divided by the number of hours it takes to produce a toy car. Similarly for belts, if I have eight hours and it takes an hour for a worker to make one belt, then per worker per day, eight divided by one, I could produce eight belts. And we could do the same thing for country B, and I encourage you to pause the video if you haven't done so already and try to fill this column out. Well, in country B, if it takes four hours to produce a toy car per worker, that means you take eight hours divided by four hours that you could produce two toy cars in a day per worker. If it takes three hours to produce a belt, well then you take your eight hours, divide it by three hours per belt, and you're gonna be able to make 8/3 belts per worker per day. This is the same thing as 2 2/3 belts per worker per day. So as you can see, we can easily translate between the input world and the output world. And then we could use this to calculate opportunity cost. So let's do that. Let me write opportunity cost. And I'll make another table here. So country A, country B, and then I have the toy cars, and then I have the belts. Let me do the belts in that orange color. I have the belts, and then let me set up my table. We're almost there. At any point in time, pause this video and see if you can figure out the opportunity cost given the information that we already have. We took this table to figure out this table, and now we could take this table to figure out this one. Well, let's do this together now. So, toy cars. What's the opportunity cost in country A? Well, one way to think about it is in country A, the same energy to produce four toy cars, I'll call it four c, c for cars. We could also use that to produce eight belts. So, if I were to divide both sides by four, the energy to create one car is equal to the energy to create two belts. So my opportunity cost of a car is two belts. And if I start with this original equation and just divide both sides by eight, I would solve for the energy for a belt. And so that would be four over eight is 1/2 of the energy to make a car is equal to the energy to make a belt. And so the opportunity cost of a belt is 1/2 a car. 1/2 a car. And like always, this and this are reciprocals of each other. And we could do this same exercise for country B. And once again, I keep emphasizing, try to pause the video. If you do this on your own as opposed to just watching me do it, it'll stick a lot better in your brain. Alright, in country B, the same energy to make two cars, toy cars, with that same energy I could make 8/3 belts. 8/3 belts right over here. So the energy to make a car, divide both sides by two, is equal to, instead of one car I can make 4/3 of a belt. And so I'll just write this as 1 1/3 of a belt. And then if I start right over here and I multiply both sides by 3/8, actually, let me do that over here. So I have 3/8 times two c is equal to 8/3 b times 3/8. These cancel out. And over here I'm gonna have 6/8 c. 6/8 c is the same thing as 3/4 c is equal to b. So, instead of making one belt, I could take that same energy and make 3/4 of a toy car. 3/4 of a toy car. So given everything that we've just done, which country has the comparative advantage in toy cars? Well, to figure that out, we just look at the opportunity cost for toy cars and we compare them. In country A, the opportunity cost is two belts while in country B it's only 1 1/3 belts. So country B has the comparative advantage right over here. Comparative advantage in toy cars. And then in belts, 1/2 of a car is less than 3/4 of a car. In belts, we see that country A has the comparative advantage. And now what's always interesting about thinking about this is notice, country B has the comparative advantage in toy cars. It has less of an opportunity cost in toy cars. Even though country A has the absolute advantage, its workers are more efficient at producing toy cars. A worker can produce four cars in country A versus two in country B. But despite that, because of the opportunity cost, it would actually make sense for country B to focus on cars and for country A to focus on the belts. But the big picture here is we're thinking about comparative advantage. And instead of thinking about with an output lens from the beginning, we started with an input lens, converted that to an output lens, calculated opportunity cost, and then was able to figure out which countries had a comparative advantage in which products.",economics-finance-domain_ap-microeconomics_basic-economic-concepts
" So let's just review what we've seen with budget lines. Let's say I'm making $20 a month. So my income is $20 per month. Let's say per month. The price of chocolate is $1 per bar. And the price of fruit is $2 per pound. And we've already done this before, but I'll just redraw a budget line. So this axis, let's say this is the quantity of chocolate. I could have picked it either way. And that is the quantity of fruit. If I spend all my money on chocolate, I could buy 20 bars of chocolate a month. So that is 20. This is 10 right over here. At these prices, if I spent all my money on fruit I could buy 10 pounds per month. So this is 10. So that's 10 pounds per month. That would be 20. And so I have a budget line that looks like this. And the equation of this budget line is going to be-- well, I could write it like this. My budget, 20, is going to be equal to the price of chocolate, which is 1, times the quantity of chocolate. So this is 1 times the quantity of chocolate, plus the price of fruit, which is 2 times the quantity of fruit. And if I want to write this explicitly in terms of my quantity of chocolate, since I put that on my vertical axis and that tends to be the more dependent axis, I can just subtract 2 times the quantity of fruit from both sides. And I can flip them. And I get my quantity of chocolate is equal to 20 minus 2 times my quantity of fruit. And I get this budget line right over there. We've also looked at the idea of an indifference curve. So for example, let's say I'm sitting at some point on my budget line where I have-- let's say I am consuming 18 bars of chocolate and 1 pound of fruit. 18-- and you can verify that make sense, it's going to be $18 plus $2, which is $20. So let's say I'm at this point on my budget line. 18 bars of chocolate, so this is in bars, and 1 pound of fruit per month. So that is 1. And this is in pounds. And this is chocolate, and this is fruit right over here. Well, we know we have this idea of an indifference curve. There's different combinations of chocolate and fruit to which we are indifferent, to which we would get the same exact total utility. And so we can plot all of those points. I'll do it in white. It could look something like this. I'll do it as a dotted line, it makes it a little bit easier. So let me draw it like this. So let's say I'm indifferent between any of these points, any of those points right over there. Let me draw it a little bit better. So between any of these points right over there. So for example, I could have 18 bars of chocolate and 1 pound of fruit, or I could have-- let's say that is 4 bars of chocolate and roughly 8 pounds of fruit. I'm indifferent. I get the same exact total utility. Now, am I maximizing my total utility at either of those points? Well, we've already seen that anything to the top right of our indifference curve of this white curve right over here-- let me label this. This is our indifference curve. Everything to the top right of our indifference curve is preferable. We're going to get more total utility. So let me color that in. So everything to the top right of our indifference curve is going to be preferable. So all of these other points on our budget line, even a few points below or budget line, where we would actually save money, are preferable. So either of these points are not going to maximize our total utility. We can maximize or total utility at all of these other points in between, along our budget line. So to actually maximize our total utility what we want to do is find a point on our budget line that is just tangent, that exactly touches at exactly one point one of our indifference curves. We could have an infinite number of indifference curves. There could be another indifference curve that looks like that. There could be another indifferent curve that looks like that. All that says is that we are indifferent between any points on this curve. And so there is an indifference curve that touches exactly this budget line, or exactly touches the line at one point. And so I might have an indifference curve that looks like this. Let me do this in a vibrant color, in magenta. So I could have an indifference curve that looks like this. And because it's tangent, it touches at exactly one point. And also the slope of my indifference curve, which we've learned was the marginal rate of substitution, is the exact same as the slope of our budget line right over there, which we learned earlier was the relative price. So this right about here is the optimal allocation on our budget line. That right here is optimal. And how do we know it is optimal? Well, there is no other point on the budget line that is to the top right. In fact, every other point on our budget line is to the bottom left of this indifference curve. So every other point on our budget line is not preferable. So remember, everything below an indifference curve-- so all of this shaded area. Let me actually do it in another color. Because indifference curve, we are different. But everything below an indifference curve, so all of this area in green, is not preferable. And every other point on the budget line is not preferable to that point right over there. Because that's the only point-- or I guess you could say, every other point on our budget line is not preferable to the points on the indifference curve. So they're also not preferable to that point right over there which actually is on the indifference curve. Now, let's think about what happens. Let's think about what happens if the price of fruit were to go down. So the price of fruit were to go from $2 to $1 per pound. So if the price of fruit went from $2 to $1, then our actual budget line will look different. Our new budget line. I'll do it in blue, would look like this. If we spent all our money on chocolate, we could buy 20 bars. If we spent all of our money on fruit at the new price, we could buy 20 pounds of fruit. So our new budget line would look something like that. So that is our new budget line. So now what would be the optimal allocation of our dollars or the best combination that we would buy? Well, we would do the exact same exercise. We would, assuming that we had data on all of these indifference curves, we would find the indifference curve that is exactly tangent to our new budget line. So let's say that this point right over here is exactly tangent to another indifference curve. So just like that. So there's another indifference curve that looks like that. Let me draw it a little bit neater. So it looks something like that. And so based on how the price-- if we assume we have access to these many, many, many, many, many indifference curves, we can now see based on, all else equal, how a change in the price of fruit changed the quantity of fruit we demanded. Because now our optimal spent is this point on our new budget line which looks like it's about, well, give or take, about 10 pounds of fruit. So all of a sudden, when we were-- so let's think about just the fruit. Everything else we're holding equal. So just the fruit, let's do, when the price was $2, the quantity demanded was 8 pounds. And now when the price is $1, the quantity demanded is 10 pounds. And so what we're actually doing, and once again, we're kind of looking at the exact same ideas from different directions. Before we looked at it in terms of marginal utility per dollar and we thought about how you maximize it. And we were able to change the prices and then figure out and derive a demand curve from that. Here we're just looking at it from a slightly different lens, but they really are all of the same ideas. But by-- assuming if we had access to a bunch of indifference curves, we can see how a change in price changes our budget line. And how that would change the optimal quantity we would want of a given product. So for example, we could keep doing this and we could plot our new demand curve. So I could do a demand curve now for fruit. At least I have two points on that demand curve. So if this is the price of fruit and this is the quantity demanded of fruit, when the price is $2, the quantity demanded is 8. And when the price is-- actually, let me do it a little bit different. When the price is $2-- these aren't to scale-- the quantity demanded is 8. Actually let me do it here-- is 8. And these aren't to scale. But when the price is $1, the quantity demanded is 10. So $2, 8, the quantity demanded is 10. And so our demand curve, these are two points on it. But we could keep changing it up assuming we had access to a bunch of indifference curves. We could keep changing it up and eventually plot our demand curve, that might look something like that.",economics-finance-domain_microeconomics_choices-opp-cost-tutorial
" I'm going to draw for you two of the most important organs in our body. And actually, on the left and right side of our body, they pretty much look like that, like little kidney beans. And in fact, that's what they are. They're kidneys. And so we have some arteries, the renal arteries that flow into them. And renal is just another word referring to kidneys, and we've got renal veins with blood flowing back out of them. So once the blood is headed back to the heart, we call it a renal vein. And there are two of them. And probably the most important part about these kidneys, certainly the thing that makes them really unique, is that they have these ureters. And these ureters drain urine into a bladder. And actually, I'll draw that right here. That's the bladder. And the ureters are the third tube coming out of our kidneys. And then when you're ready to urinate, you can release all that urine from your bladder into the outside world. And so there are three basic things that I want you remember coming into and out of kidneys-- the renal arteries and the renal veins and the ureter. Now, to really make sense of it, you've got to think about how the artery might split up. So let's say we go back to the artery and you follow it, and it starts kind of branching. Let's say it makes five little branches. And then it might have more branches off of those branches and finally maybe even some more branches, and eventually it's not even an artery anymore. Right? All these little branches are so tiny, you would call them arterioles. And let's just take this arteriole, this little guy, and let's see what happens. So let's say I take that little guy and show you on the left side of the screen what that would look like. So let's take a look at this arteriole a little bit closer. So this is our Afferent arteriole, A capitalized. And it's called Afferent because it's headed toward something. Afferent arteriole. And let's not forget where it comes from. It's coming from the renal artery headed towards something, and that something is this. The artery-- or the arteriole, rather, starts making a lot of little turn-backs on itself and finally straightens out. And when it does we call it the Efferent arteriole. So that's how we keep straight whether it's coming or going from this little network, if you want to call it that, of blood vessels. And in fact, this little network of blood vessels, if you look under a microscope, is actually being hugged by something like this. This is actually really interesting. This is the first time we're taking a look at something that is not a blood vessel in the kidney, and it begins our journey of urine. So this thing is called the Bowman's capsule. This is the thing in yellow that I've drawn for you. And whenever things are named like this, you've got to wonder, who was Mr. Bowman? And Mr. Bowman, turns out, was from England. Actually, he was a very curious fellow. And so he looked under a microscope. And he noticed that if you look right where these little tufts of blood vessels are, you can actually see that there's something surrounding each of them. And so he called that Bowman's capsule, and so that's what we still call it today. So England was laying claim to parts of the kidney anatomy. You may not even have known that. So that's Bowman's capsule, and that's the first part of the nephron. I'll actually show you all the parts of the nephron. So the next part of the nephron-- and nephron just means kind of the unit of the kidney that we care about. The next part is looking really squiggly, very convoluted. Right? And I'm trying to draw it that way purposefully, because I want to show you a way of remembering that this is actually called the proximal-- because it's near the Bowman's capsule, so it's proximal-- convoluted tubule, because this is one long tubule, like a little tube. And so this is the proximal convoluted tubule. So basically, the next part of the nephron, after it starts in the Bowman's capsule, is the proximal convoluted tubule. And then it gets into kind of a long deep loop, long loop like that. And this loop is called the loop of Henle. So you're seeing now part three is Loop of Henle. Now, loop make sense. But of Henle, you've got to wonder, again, is this another British guy? Who is Mr. Henle? Mr. Henle, it turns out, is actually not British. But he's from another part of Europe. Let's see if you can guess before I finish this drawing. He discovered that if you follow the nephron deep into the middle of the kidney, it has these little loops, very delicate loops, but very important in helping urine form. And he was a German scientist. And so if the British are going to identify something, so will the Germans. And so we still call that the loop of Henle. And after the Loop of Henle, we have another area that's very convoluted. And so you can guess what we call this where, because we're going to probably try to stay consistent. And if the first part was called the proximal convoluted tubule, we would call this not the proximal, because now it's not near anymore, but it's a little further away. We would call this the distal, meaning further away, convoluted, because it's still convoluted, tubule. So this is the distal convoluted tubule. And finally, there's a fifth part of all this. The fifth part of all this is a giant tube of collection. So all this stuff goes into a collecting tube. And I'm actually showing you where all the other distal convoluted tubules might be dumping in as well. Maybe there. And eventually all this stuff is going to go to the same place, which is down to the ureter. So we've seen now how things go to the ureter. You can see how things come from the renal artery. But you're probably still wondering-- oh actually, I didn't label this for you. This is the collecting tube. You're probably still wondering where is the renal vein in all this. I mean, I still drew the Efferent arteriole as being red, and it's got oxygen. So where does the venous blood come from? And the answer is right here. So you basically get red blood or oxygenated blood flowing over all these parts of the tubule. So all the parts of the proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting duct all get wonderful blood. And then finally, when all is said and done, it all drains into one thing, one final renal vein. And that's with all of the blood coming together. So this little network is considered-- this little network of capillaries, then, is considered, right here, the peritubular, going around the tubule, tubular capillaries. And that makes sense. Now, you can see the renal artery blood coming in, going in through the Afferent arteriole, then the Efferent arteriole, and then draining back into the peritubular capillaries and finally, the renal vein. And this important structure in yellow that I've drawn has five parts to it, and all five parts coming together are called the nephron. And so this is an important structure, and we'll talk about different parts of the nephron in future videos. But this is an important structure, to at least get a sense for how it looks and what the different parts are called.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system
" Hello and welcome to that one day of the year when, well, everyone else is building up how great Pi is. I'm here to tear it down, because you deserve the truth. Forget about the part where Pi isn't the correct circle concept. This Pi day, I'm not about how people worship Pi for being infinite for going on forever. First of all, Pi is not infinite. It is more three, but you know, less than four. There are cultures where three is the biggest number, so I don't want to be insensitive, but trust me on this four is not infinite and neither is Pi. I know it's not about it's magnitude, it's about all those digits, infinite digits going on forever, but first of all it doesn't go anywhere. It just is. There's no time element. If you had a number line, Pi would be exactly one point on that number line sitting perfect still right now. It's not going to start wondering off on an infinite journey that takes forever, or even on a finite journey that takes forever, or an infinite journey that takes finite time. Pi is a number not a process. Secondly, yeah, so it's got infinite digits. So what, one-third has infinite digits. There's exactly as exactly as many digits in one-third and in Pi as in 99.9999 repeating. Oh, and there's also as many digits as in numbers like, say, five, I know, big number. It's even more than four, so, it's piratically like double infinity. Which, it actuality kind of is, because in decimal innovation there's secretly infinite zeros in all of these places. Zero's going out to forever. Ooh! So mysterious, and then zero's going the other way too. Which is actually not any more zeros than if they only went one way. No. Pi is not especially infinite in any way, it's more like in-between-finite. There's an infinite number of rational numbers. for any two factions you can find another fraction that's between them again and again and again. There's never any fractions that are right next to each other on the number line. But, despite there's a infinite amount of rational numbers, Pi isn't one of them. Take any rational number, and you can find an infinite number of rational numbers that are closer to Pi on either side. Pi is between all of them in one of the gaps. It isn't infinite. It's in-between-finite. So what, you think that's special, as if there's just one hole in the rational number line exactly where Pi is, and once you plug that in with a super special number, you're good to go? Maybe, a few more for E and [towel] and square root too. No! Super nope! The in-between-[finiteness] of Pi, its irrationality is an incredibility un-special property. Turns out, most real numbers are irrational. It's the nicely packaged rational numbers that are weird. In fact, if you threw a dart and picked a random number off the number line, the chance of getting a rational number is exactly zero. I'll get into kinds of infinities some other time, but [unintelligible] to say the number of rational numbers, like the number of digits in Pi, is the small and unimpressive countable infinity. While the number of irrational numbers is so much bigger than countable infinity, that when you compare the two, cantabile infinity looks like zero. So, I don't know why anyone would make a fus about the grand infinities and forever, as about the boring little number like Pi. And of course, those are just the first couple of kinds of infinities in an infinite number of infinities in their correspondingly more in-between-[finiter] numbers like the [infinitesimals]. So, don't let Pi impress you by being a member of an unaccountably infinite set of in-between-infinite number either. The only thing even a little weird about Pi is that you do get an irrational number by taking such a simple ratio of such a simple geometric object. Surely that never happens with other simple ratios of other simple geometric objects. Oh wait! Their in everything! What are the chances? No! Let's pretend math equals arithmetic, and then get all surprised and amazed when the moment you leave arithmetic that you get a non-arithmetic number as if it were some odd unpredictable phenomenon. That way, by the time you get to calculus you won't have any idea what's going on and memorize just enough symbol shuffling to pass your class without ever realizing that you were dealing with infinities two levels deeper than the infinity you think is so cool when Pi does it. Pi is not special. Yeah, Pi can be fun, and I'd never deny you your deserts, but maybe try some real food once in a while.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_vi-hart
" -  So, we're told that g of x is equal to x squared plus 5 x minus 3 and h of y is equal to 3 times y minus 1 squared, minus 5. And then, we're asked, what is h of g of negative 6? And the way it's written might look a little strange to you. This little circle that we have in between the h and the g, that's our function composition symbol. So, function, function composition, composition, composition symbol. And one way to rewrite this, it might make a little bit more sense. So, this h of g of negative 6. You could rewrite this as, this is going to be the same thing as g of negative 6, and then h of that. So, h of g of negative 6. Notice, I spoke this out the same way that I said this. This is h of g of negative 6. This is h of g of negative 6. I find the second notation far more intuitive, but it's good to become familiar with this function composition notation, this little circle, because you might see that sometime and you shouldn't stress, it's just the same thing as what we have right over here. Now, what is h of g of negative 6? Well, we just have to remind ourselves that this means that we're going to take the number negative 6, we're going to input it into our function g, and then that will output g of negative 6, whatever that number is, we'll figure it out in a second, and then we're going to input that into our function h. We're going to input that into our function h. And then, what we output is going to be h of g of negative six, which is what we want to figure out. h of g of negative 6. So, we just have to do it one step at a time. A lot of times, when you first start looking at these function composition, it seems really convoluted and confusing, but you just have to, I want you to take a breath and take it one step at a time. Well, let's figure out what g of negative 6 is. It's going to evaluate to a number in this case. And then, we input that number into the function h, and then we'll figure out another -- that's going to map to another number. So, g of negative 6. Let's figure that out. g of negative 6 is equal to negative 6 squared, plus 5 times negative 6, minus 3, which is equal to positive 36, minus 30, minus 3. So, that's equal to what? 36 minus 33, which is equal to 3. So, g of negative 6 is equal to 3. g of negative 6 is equal to 3. g of negative 6 is equal to 3. You input negative 6 into g, it outputs 3. And so, h of g of negative 6 has now simplified to just h of 3 because g of negative 6 is 3. So, let's figure out what h of 3 is. h of 3 --. notice, whatever we outputted from g, we're inputting that now into h. So, that's the number 3, so h of 3 is going to be 3 times 3 minus 1, 3 minus 1 squared, minus 5, which is equal to 3 times 2 squared, this is 2 right over here, minus 5, which is equal to 3 times 4 minus 5, which is equal to 12 minus 5, which is equal to 7. And we're done. So, you input negative 6 into g, you get 3. And then, you take that output from g and you put it into h and you get 7. So, this right over here is 7. All of this has come out to be equal to 7. So, h of g of negative 6 is equal to 7. h of g of negative 6 is equal to 7. Input negative 6 into g, take that output and input it into h, and you're gonna get 7.",math_engageny-precalc_precalc-3
" -  If five is divided into pieces that are each one half of a whole, how many pieces are there? And this would be the equivalent of saying, ""What is five divided by 1/2?"" And they help us out with this visual. So pause this video and see if you can figure out what that is. How many pieces would you get if you divide five into pieces that are each one half of a whole? All right, now let's work through this together. So here on this number line we go from zero to five, and then notice they've divided into pieces that are each a half of a whole. This is one piece right over here. So how many of those halves, so this right over here is one half, how many of those halves does it take to make five? Well, two halves make a whole, and we have five wholes. So it's going to be five times two, or 10. And we see that right over here. One half, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 halves make five wholes. So this is going to be equal to 10. So five divided into pieces of one half, or five wholes divided into pieces of one half would be equal to 10 pieces. Let's do another example. So we have a similar question here. Here we're asked, ""If three wholes are divided into pieces that are each 1/6 of a whole, how many pieces are there?"" Once again, pause this video and think about it. Well, they really help us out with this visual because we have three wholes. This is one whole, two whole, and then three wholes, and then we have divided them into pieces that are each 1/6 of a whole. This is a sixth right over here, this is a sixth right over here, so each of these are sixths. And so, if we look at this, we have six sixths in a whole, and so in three wholes we're gonna have six, 12, 18 pieces. And you could literally just count these up. But it makes sense. If you take three wholes and you divide it into sixths, so this is a sixth right over here, each of these wholes are going to be six sixths, so three wholes are going to be three times six sixths, or 18 sixths. There you go.",math_5th-engage-ny_engage-5th-module-4
" Now that we know how a signal can spread through a neuron, through an electrotonic potential and action potential and combinations of the two, let's put it all together by looking again at the structure of a neuron, the anatomy of a neuron, and thinking about why it has that anatomy and how it all can work. So we've already talked about the dendrites as being where the neuron can be stimulated from multiple inputs. If we're in the brain, these dendrites might be near the terminal ends of axons of other neurons. If we're some type of sensory cell, these dendrites could be stimulated by some type of sensory input. But let's just say, for the sake of argument, they are stimulated in some way. And because they're stimulated in some way, it allows positive ions to flood into the neuron from the outside. As we know, there's a potential difference. It's more negative inside of the neuron than outside of the neuron. And so if a channel gets opened up because of some stimulus, that would allow positive ions to flow in. And the primary positive ions we've been talking about are the sodium ions. Maybe this is some type of sodium gate that gets opened up because of this stimulus. So when that happens, you will have electrotonic spread. You will have an electrotonic potential being spread. So let's say that we had a voltmeter right here on the axon hillock. It's kind of the hill that leads to the axon right over here. So what you might see happening after some amount of time-- so let me draw. So let's say this is our voltage in millivolts across the membrane-- our voltage difference, I should say. This is the passage of time. Let's say the stimulus happens at time 0. But right at time 0, we haven't really noticed it with our voltmeter. Our voltage right across the membrane right over there is at that equilibrium, negative 70 millivolts. But after some small amount of time, this electrotonic potential has gotten to this point, because all of these positive charges are trying to get away from each other. It's gotten to that point. And you might see a bump in the voltage-- in the voltage difference, I guess I should say. This thing might go up. So it might look something like that. Now, that by itself might not be-- we might have gotten the voltage difference low enough, I guess we could say. Or we might not have gotten the voltage inside of the cell positive enough in order to trigger the voltage-gated ion channels. And so maybe nothing happens. Maybe this right over here, this is negative 55 millivolts. And so that's what you have to get the voltage up to, the voltage difference up to, in order to trigger the ion channels right over there. So those are the sodium channels to get positive charge in. Here's the potassium channels to get the positive charge out. The axon hillock has a ton of these, because these are really there. Once they get triggered, they can trigger an impulse that can then go down the entire axon, and maybe stimulate other things, maybe in the brain or whatever else this neuron might be connected to. So maybe that stimulus by itself didn't trigger it. But let's say that there's another stimulus that happens right at the same time, or around the same time. And that happens. And on its own, that might have caused a similar type of bump right over here. But when you add the two together and they're happening at the same time, their combined bumps are enough to trigger an action potential in the hillock, or a series of action potentials in the hillock. And so then, you really have, essentially, fired the neuron. So now all sorts of positive charge gets flushed into the neuron. And then purely through electrotonic spread, you will have this electrotonic potential spread down the axon. Now, this is the interesting part, because we can think a little bit about, what is the best way for an axon to be designed? In general, if you're trying to transfer a current, the ideal thing to do is, the thing that you're transferring the current down should conduct really well. Or you could say it has low resistance. But you want it to be surrounded by an insulator. You want it to be surrounded. So if this was a cross section, you want it to be surrounded by an insulator that has high resistance. And the reason is because you don't want the potential to leak across your membrane-- high resistance right over here. If you didn't have something high resistance around it, your current would actually go slower. This is true if you're just dealing with electronics. If you just had a bunch of copper wires on one side, and you had some copper wires that were surrounded by a really good insulator, a really good resistor-- for example, plastic or rubber of some kind. The current is actually going to have less energy loss. It's going to travel faster when it's surrounded by an insulator. So you might say, OK, well gee. The best thing to do would be to surround this entire axon with a good insulator. And for the most part, that is true. It is surrounded by a good insulator. That is what the myelin sheath is. So let's say we want to surround this whole thing with just one big grouping of Schwann's cells, so one big myelin sheath-- which is a good insulator. It does not conduct current well. So this right over here is just one big myelin sheath right over here. Now, what's the problem with this? Well, if this axon is really long-- and let's say, you know, you're a dinosaur or something. And you're trying to go up your neck, and your neck is 20 feet long. Or even a human being, we're a reasonable size. And you're going several feet, or even whatever, you want to go a reasonable distance purely with electrotonic spread, your signal, remember, it dissipates. Your signal is going to be really weak right over here. You're going to have a weak signal on the other end. It might not be even strong enough to make anything interesting happen at these terminals, which wouldn't be strong enough to trigger, maybe, other neurons, or whatever else might need to happen at this other end. So then you say, OK, well then why don't we try to boost the signal? Well, how would you boost the signal? You say, OK. I like having this myelin sheath. But why don't we put gaps in the myelin sheath every so often? And then those gaps would allow the membrane to interface with the outside. And in those areas, we could put some voltage-gated channels that can release action potentials, in order to essentially boost the signal. And that's is exactly what the anatomy of a typical neuron is like. So instead of just one big insulating sheath like this, it would-- let me make some gaps here. Whoops, I'm going to do that in black. So actually, let me just draw it like this. Let me just erase this. So clear, and let me clear this. That's good enough. And so what we could do is we could put gaps in it right over here where the axon, the axonal membrane itself can interface with its surroundings. And of course, we know we call those gaps the nodes of Ranvier, or Ran-Veer. I'm not really sure how to pronounce it. So let me put those gaps in here. So you put those gaps in here, so these are the myelin sheath. And this right over here is a node of Ranvier. These are nodes of Ran-Veer, or Ranvier. And right in those little nodes, right in those nodes, right where the myelin sheath isn't, we can put these voltage-gated channels to essentially boost the signal. If the signal had to go electrotonically all the way over here, it'd be very weak. It's going to dissipate as it goes down, but it could be just strong enough right at this point in order to trigger these voltage-gated channels, in order to essentially boost the signal again, in order to trigger an action potential, boost the signal. And now the signal is boosted, it'll dissipate, dissipate, dissipate, boost. And it'll boost right over here again. And then it'll dissipate, dissipate, dissipate, and boost. Dissipate, dissipate, boost. And so by having this combination, you want the myelin sheath. You want the insulator in order to keep the transmission of the current to fast, in order to have minimal energy loss. But you do need these areas where the myelin sheath isn't in order to boost the signal, in order for the action potentials to get triggered, and so your signal can keep being-- well, I guess keep being amplified, if we wanted to talk in kind of electrical engineering speak. And this type of conduction, where the signal just keeps boosting, and if you were just to superficially observe it, it looks like the signal is almost jumping. It gets triggered here, then it gets triggered, here then it gets triggered here, then it gets triggered here, then it gets triggered here. 1This is called saltatory conduction. 1It comes from the Latin word saltare-- once again, 1I don't know how to pronounce. 1My Latin isn't too good. 1But it comes from the Latin word saltare, 1which means to jump around or to hop around. 1And that's because it looks like the signal is hopping around. 1But that's not exactly what's happening. 1The signal is traveling passively through. 1It gets triggered here in the axon hillock. 1Then it travels passively through electrotonic spread. 1And then it gets boosted. 1And you have the myelin sheath around it 1to make sure it goes as fast as possible, 1and you get very little loss of signal. 1And then it gets boosted at the nodes of Ranvier, 1because it triggers these voltage-gated channels again. 1That triggers an action potential. 1And then your signal gets boosted, 1and then it dissipates-- boosted, dissipates, boosted, 1dissipates, boosted, dissipates. 1Maybe it could even get boosted again. 1And then it can trigger whatever else it has to trigger.",science_biology_human-biology
" Let's go ahead and use our pressure volume loop. I'm going to sketch out how afterload would make things change on this. So let's just quickly sketch this out. I'm going to put pressure over here. And I'm going to start out with just two lines. First, and this is probably the one I want you to keep an eye on, this is the end systolic pressure volume relationship. And then I'm going to also put on there the end diastolic pressure volume relationship, something like that. And so these are kind of the first two lines that we know are going to be helpful in sketching out our pressure volume loop. Then we have this other line, right? We have this EA line. This is Arterial Elastance. And there's a good formula here that is very, very helpful. It's the pressure at the end of systole over stroke volume. Remember, any elastance is kind of thinking along the lines of a pressure over a volume. And this red dot represents the pressure at the end of systole. And this other red dot here is going to kind of show you where it crosses the x-axis, the volume. And that's helpful because then we can kind of quickly figure out what the stroke volume would be. This would be our stroke volume here. So we have it sketched out. And I can actually take this and now draw in the PV loop, which would be something like this kind of chugging along. And you might be tempted to make it cross right there at the point where the purple line is, but remember, we have to go a little bit further because that's not where the volume is going to be. The volume is actually going to be a little bit further along. So to be true to that, I'm just going to draw it a little bit further. But I wanted to draw the first line just to show you how you might have thought it looked. But that is not where it crosses. And then, of course, you have contraction, and you have ejection of blood into the aorta. So this is our pressure volume loop, right? This is what it looks like. And at the top of this loop, we have ejection. This is where blood, I said, is coming out of the left ventricle and going into the aorta. And if I actually just kind of trace around this part of it-- this is ejection-- you would probably remember that this is where something important is taking place. And specifically, I'm talking about afterload. Remember, we actually defined afterload. According to this part of the pressure volume loop, we said-- and this is going back to Laplace. We said that afterload is basically wall stress happening during ejection. So during the entire ejection phase, the wall stress is what our afterload is. And we actually simplified this to-- or not simplified, but kind of wrote this out, I should say, to Laplace's law, which is pressure times radius of the left ventricle during ejection divided by 2 times the wall thickness during ejection. So this is the formula for afterload. And we have to remember that it's occurring during the entire ejection, during the entire part I traced out. But for simplicity, because a lot of times we don't actually sit there and calculate all the different points, we oftentimes look to this value, this pressure at the end of systole. Because, of course, this is definitely one of the points during ejection. You could say the final moment of ejection would be that point right there , where the pressure is end systolic. And so we often use that value to kind of be a marker for what afterload is doing. And remember, we know that pressure and afterload are very closely related. You can see it in the formula right there. So we do use the end systolic pressure as a marker. And I guess now the question I want to pose is what would happen if we actually increased that number? What if we increased the pressure at the end of systole? What would happen? So on the graph it would basically look maybe something like this, where now your value is higher. This is our new pressure. This is the new pressure at the end of systole. I'll put p prime. And if that's the new pressure at the end of systole, then we have to think through what else would change? I guess that's the question. And you know, of course, the first thing to think about is the fact that this is going to drop down, this line. And if our pressure has gone up, then you know our stroke volume has gone down. So our stroke volume is going to be a little bit more contracted or smaller. And you remember now we have a formula. I may actually just jot down the formula for us, just make a little bit of space. Maybe I'll just actually leave it. That way, you can see everything. But I'll put the formula over here. We have our formula, which says that elastance, or arterial elastance, equals pressure at end systole divided by stroke volume. And all that equals heart rate times resistance, right? And in this case, I'm saying that I'm going to increase this number, and I'm going to decrease this number. So what I've done is basically changed the slope. So I know that the elastance is going to change. And if I've done that, the only way to really accomplish that would be to either increase the heart rate or increase the resistance. Already I'm getting some interesting information about how this might have happened. I can ask, hey, did that person's heart rate go up? Or are their blood vessels more constricted? Because one of those two things must have happened to cause this increase in afterload that I'm drawing for you. And either way, to draw it out, it would be kind of the same. You'd basically say, OK, well, if this is my new end systolic pressure, I know that I need to draw it so that the point where it crosses the volume axis is the same. And actually, I can make it kind of extend on the other side, too. I can say something like that. And this is what would happen. So one of the things I want to point out is there is a difference between EA and afterload. So let's talk about that difference. When I talk about afterload, I really want you to keep remembering or keep in mind the fact that we're talking about the entire line, so this entire area or this entire part of the curve, which I'll redraw here, which would look something like this, right? That entire thing is the afterload. And we kind of simplified that. I keep reminding us that we keep simplifying that down to just pressure at end systole. But really, afterload is more than just that one point. But we use that as kind of a marker for how afterload is doing at every other point. And we can see pretty clearly that, of course, the afterload has gone up at every point including the very last point, which is end systolic. And the new curve, of course, if I was just to draw it in, would look like this. Let me just keep a blue line so it stays steady. The new line would look like this and would actually come up like this and do this. That would be my new line. So the pressure volume loop does change. And you can see that if afterload is pressure end systole, if that's what we're using as our marker-- I guess maybe I should put it in quotes just to make sure we don't actually think that that's afterload because we know that the definition of afterload is much more than just that-- then EA is going to include part of that. It's the end systolic pressure. But it's also includes stroke volume. So one of them is the pressure over volume and the other is just the pressure. And if we're thinking about that, remember that many things are going to affect, then, this end systolic pressure, many things, including things like contractility will affect this. And preload will affect this. So many things are going to affect afterload. But not too many things are going to affect our EA. So remember, if you're having a change in EA, the things that are going to change EA would be like heart rate and resistance. So truly when you're breaking this down, just try to keep this in mind that the formula you want to always remember is this guy. And this will always get you to the right answer, that if you are thinking afterload, you're really talking about everything that could affect afterload including preload and contractility, because all those things can affect which direction this goes, because they are going to change stroke volume. Whereas if you're going to talk about the elastance, then really the only things that are going to change the overall elastance, this whole thing, are going to be things like heart rate or resistance. So it's actually pretty simple when you look at the formula. But I know a lot of times people confuse the word ""elastance,"" arterial elastance, with afterload, and they think it could be the same thing. And it's true that they're very related, but they're not exactly the same thing. So as a final point, in this case, we increased the arterial elastance by either changing the heart rate-- increasing it-- or increasing the resistance . But we could have also decreased the heart rate resistance, and we would have seen a smaller arterial elastance.",science_health-and-medicine_circulatory-system
" What I want to do in this video is compare investment to consumption. And we're going to think about it in two contexts. One I would call the everyday conventional context. And then the other one would be how we would think about it in an economics context. Because these words mean something very particular to an economist. And that's important that it means something particular, because we're going to start using these words, or this terminology, or these classifications, to understand where GDP is coming from. So in everyday-- let me draw a line over here. This is going to be everyday or, conversational, versions of this term. And down here, we'll put the economics, the economic versions of this term, especially when we think of it in the context of accounting for GDP. And they're not necessarily all that different. But they are different in important ways. So in investment, really in both cases, you can generally view it as something that you do to get some future gain. So for example, if I today build a house-- so I build a house. So that is the house. I built it today. And this will be the timeline. The house will keep lasting. And it's an investment, because it's going to be giving me future gain. A year from now, I'll still be able to live in that house. So I will have the saved rent. That's a future gain, a future gain two years from now. It'll keep giving some type of gain. You could have a ficial instrument, maybe some type of debt instrument. You're lending money to someone else. So maybe you buy a bond, which is essentially you lending money to someone else. That is an investment in the everyday sense of it. Because when have that asset, when you've bought that asset, it's going to pay off something in the future. It's going to pay off some interest or some profits. And in the everyday sense, I would consider something like-- hopefully it would be-- going to college would be an investment. So education, I'll say education, because you invest that time and energy and education, it's going to keep paying off. Hopefully by doing that, you're going to get better employment and higher wages the rest of your life. It will keep paying off. So this is the everyday notion of investment. The everyday notion of consumption, the way I think about it, is you are buying something or you're doing something that you're just going to use up in the short-term. And just by using it up, whatever that object is, if you just use it up-- and it's just going to hopefully benefit you in some way, but it's more of a short-term thing-- I would consider that consumption in the everyday sense. So if you go buy a candy bar and eat it, you have consumed the candy bar. You have not made an investment. If you go to a movie, that is consumption. And I'm not making any value judgment that one is better than the other. Investment, at the end of the day, you're investing so that you can get future benefit that could lead to consumption. Because at the end of the day, consumption is one of the things that might make your life a little bit better off. So I'm not saying that one is better than the other. But watching a movie, that would also be consumption. Spending time buying a book, well, you could debate whether that's education or not. But let's say you buy a book that is not educational, that is consumption. But it is making you happier. Hopefully, it's making your life better in some way. Now, the economic definitions are related to these everyday definitions, but they're a little bit more precise. And they make the definitions in a way that they're easier to account for if you are a nation. They're easier to keep track of. So the way an economist would define it, they would define economic investment as spending on capital equipment. Capital equipment are things like, if you are a factory, you will buy the equipment to run your factory. You buy the robots. And you buy the assembly line. And you buy the wheelbarrows or whatever else, the things that have to cart things around. That is capital equipment. It would be things like inventory. So for example, the inventory-- and this is still not so different. Both of these things are being used to produce things in the future, to produce future benefit. You're buying that inventory, sometimes raw material, you're going to add value to it. And then they're going to be used to produce something in the future. It includes things like even the structures, the buildings. And so for all of this, in the economic sense, and this is why it's easier to account for, this, for the most part, is being done by the firms. And it also includes the one thing that households do, which is construction of new homes. This is from the households. Actually, the buying of a house does not show up in consumption or investment, because nothing new was produced. Something just exchanged hands. So whenever we talk about any of these things, especially when we're talking about it in precise economic terms, it's the production of new capital equipment, new inventory, new structures, new homes. If I just buy a factory from someone else, that does not add to GDP. It would not be considered investment or consumption, because I'm just transferring an asset from one person to another. It would only be added to GDP when it is first created. And on the consumption side, from an economic point of view-- let me draw a little bit of a line right over here-- consumption is considered to be any spending on final goods by households except for new homes. And let me make this even clearer. Because remember, if we're just transferring goods, that shouldn't count. So let me put it on newly produced final goods. Now, what's unintuitive a little bit over here is, according to the way we account for GDP, the tuition that you spend on a college education, that is new spending on final goods. And here are the final goods or services. The service you're getting is your education. That would be consumption. So education would fall here in the economic sense. While in the every day sense, I would consider education right over here. Maybe you are buying a car. And you're not buying a car for leisure purposes. You're buying a car because you need your car to go to work. There's an argument that that would be an investment in the everyday sense. By having that car, you have something that can take you to work every day. So you're getting future benefit. So there's an argument that maybe that's an investment in the everyday sense. But in the accounting sense, that car would sit right here. You bought a new car. But that is considered consumption. You did not buy a new house. And the whole reason, at least as far as I understand, why it's set up this way is this is this easier to account for. You look at all of the spending by firms, that's easy to account for. You essentially call that investment. Because at the end of the day, all the spending that firms are making is they're doing it to produce some good or service. So we call this investment any spending that the firms do. And on top of that, when households purchase new homes, we also call that investment. And that's just easier for the accounting offices of governments to keep track of. And everything else that households do, we consider consumption. And we'll see in the next few videos, there are a few other categories in terms of things that the government do. And then we'll have to think about imports and exports.",economics-finance-domain_ap-macroeconomics_economic-iondicators-and-the-business-cycle
" -  In this video, we're going to think about what the derivative with respect to x of the natural log of x's. And I'm gonna go straight to the punch line. It is equal to one over x. In a future video, I'm actually going to prove this. It's a little bit involved. But in this one, we're just going to appreciate that this seems like it is actually true. So right here is the graph of y is equal to the natural log of x. And just to feel good about the statement, let's try to approximate what the slope of the tangent line is at different points. So let's say right over here, when x is equal to one, what does the slope of the tangent line look like? Well, it looks like here, the slope looks like it is equal, pretty close to being equal to one, which is consistent with the statement. If x is equal to one, one over one is still one, and that seems like what we see right over there. What about when x is equal to two? Well, this point right over here is the natural log of two, but more interestingly, what's the slope here? Well, it looks like, let's see, if I try to draw a tangent line, the slop of the tangent line looks pretty close to 1/2. Well, once again, that is one over x. One over two is 1/2. Let's keep doing this. If I go right over here, when x is equal to four, this point is four comma natural log of four, but the slope of the tangent line here looks pretty close to 1/4 and if you accept this, it is exactly 1/4, and you could even go to values less than one. Right over here, when x is equal to 1/2, one over 1/2, the slope should be two. And it does indeed, let me do this in a slightly different color, it does indeed look like the slope is two over there. So once again, you take the derivative with respect to x of the natural log of x, it is one over x. And hopefully, you get a sense that that is actually true here. In a future video, we'll actually prove it.",math_old-ap-calculus-ab_ab-derivatives-advanced
" What we're going to prove in this video is a couple of fairly straightforward parallelogram-related proofs. And this first one, we're going to say, hey, if we have this parallelogram ABCD, let's prove that the opposite sides have the same length. So prove that AB is equal to DC and that AD is equal to BC. So let me draw a diagonal here. And this diagonal, depending on how you view it, is intersecting two sets of parallel lines. So you could also consider it to be a transversal. Actually, let me draw it a little bit neater than that. I can do a better job. Nope. That's not any better. That is about as good as I can do. So if we view DB, this diagonal DB-- we can view it as a transversal for the parallel lines AB and DC. And if you view it that way, you can pick out that angle ABD is going to be congruent-- so angle ABD. That's that angle right there-- is going to be congruent to angle BDC, because they are alternate interior angles. You have a transversal-- parallel lines. So we know that angle ABD is going to be congruent to angle BDC. Now, you could also view this diagonal, DB-- you could view it as a transversal of these two parallel lines, of the other pair of parallel lines, AD and BC. And if you look at it that way, then you immediately see that angle DBC right over here is going to be congruent to angle ADB for the exact same reason. They are alternate interior angles of a transversal intersecting these two parallel lines. So I could write this. This is alternate interior angles are congruent when you have a transversal intersecting two parallel lines. And we also see that both of these triangles, triangle ADB and triangle CDB, both share this side over here. It's obviously equal to itself. Now, why is this useful? Well, you might realize that we've just shown that both of these triangles, they have this pink angle. Then they have this side in common. And then they have the green angle. Pink angle, side in common, and then the green angle. So we've just shown by angle-side-angle that these two triangles are congruent. So let me write this down. We have shown that triangle-- I'll go from non-labeled to pink to green-- ADB is congruent to triangle-- non-labeled to pink to green-- CBD. And this comes out of angle-side-angle congruency. Well, what does that do for us? Well, if two triangles are congruent, then all of the corresponding features of the two triangles are going to be congruent. In particular, side DC on this bottom triangle corresponds to side BA on that top triangle. So they need to be congruent. So we get DC is going to be equal to BA. And that's because they are corresponding sides of congruent triangles. So this is going to be equal to that. And by that exact same logic, AD corresponds to CB. AD is equal to CB. And for the exact same reason-- corresponding sides of congruent triangles. And then we're done. We've proven that opposite sides are congruent. Now let's go the other way. Let's say that we have some type of a quadrilateral, and we know that the opposite sides are congruent. Can we prove to ourselves that this is a parallelogram? Well, it's kind of the same proof in reverse. So let's draw a diagonal here, since we know a lot about triangles. So let me draw. There we go. That's the hardest part. Draw it. That's pretty good. All right. So we obviously know that CB is going to be equal to itself. So I'll draw it like that. Obviously, because it's the same line. And then we have something interesting. We've split this quadrilateral into two triangles, triangle ACB and triangle DBC. And notice, all three sides of these two triangles are equal to each other. So we know by side-side-side that they are congruent. So we know that triangle A-- and we're starting at A, and then I'm going to the one-hash side. So ACB is congruent to triangle DBC. And this is by side-side-side congruency. Well, what does that do for us? Well, it tells us that all of the corresponding angles are going to be congruent. So for example, angle ABC is going to be-- so let me mark that. You can say ABC is going to be congruent to DCB. And you could say, by corresponding angles congruent of congruent triangles. I'm just using some shorthand here to save some time. So ABC is going to be congruent to DCB, so these two angles are going to be congruent. Well, this is interesting, because here you have a line. And it's intersecting AB and CD. And we clearly see that these things that could be alternate interior angles are congruent. And because we have these congruent alternate interior angles, we know that AB must be parallel to CD. So this must be parallel to that. So we know that AB is parallel to CD by alternate interior angles of a transversal intersecting parallel lines. Now, we can use that exact same logic. We also know that angle-- let me get this right. Angle ACB is congruent to angle DBC. And we know that by corresponding angles congruent of congruent triangles. So we're just saying this angle is equal to that angle. Well, once again, these could be alternate interior angles. They look like they could be. This is a transversal. And here's two lines here, which we're not sure whether they're parallel. But because the alternate interior angles are congruent, we know that they are parallel. So this is parallel to that. So we know that AC is parallel to BD by alternate interior angles. And we're done. So what we've done is-- it's interesting. We've shown if you have a parallelogram, opposite sides have the same length. And if opposite sides have the same length, then you have a parallelogram. And so we've actually proven it in both directions. And so we can actually make what you call an ""if and only if"" statement. You could say opposite sides of a quadrilateral are parallel if and only if their lengths are equal. And you say if and only if. So if they are parallel, then you could say their lengths are equal. And only if their lengths are equal are they parallel. We've proven it in both directions.",math_geometry_hs-geo-foundations
" What I want to do in this video is attempt to find the diameter of this circle right over here. And I encourage you to pause the video and try this out on your own. Well, let's think about what's going on right over here. AB is definitely a diameter of the circle. It's a straight line. It's going through the center of the circle. O is the center of the circle right over here. And so what do we know? Well, we could look at this angle right over here, angle C, and think about it is an inscribed angle. And think about the arc that it intercepts. It intercepts this arc right over here. This arc is exactly half of the circle. Angle C is inscribed. If you take these two sides or the two sides of the angle, it intercepts at A and B, and so it intercepts an arc, this green arc right over here. So the central angle right over here is 180 degrees, and the inscribed angle is going to be half of that. It's going to be 90 degrees. Or another way of thinking about it, it's going to be a right angle. And what that does for us is it tells us that triangle ACB is a right triangle. This is a right triangle, and the diameter is its hypotenuse. So we can just apply the Pythagorean theorem here. 15 squared plus 8 squared-- let me do this in magenta-- is going to be the length of side AB squared. So this side right over here, let me just call that x. That's going to be equal to x squared. So 15 squared, that's 225. 8 squared is 64, plus 64-- I want to do that in green-- is equal to x squared. 225 plus 64 is 289 is equal to x squared. And then 289 is 17 squared. And you could try out a few numbers if you're unsure about that. So x is equal to 17. So the diameter of this circle right over here is 17.",math_geometry-home_cc-geometry-circles
" We're now going to learn a little bit about gravity. And just so you know, gravity is something that, especially in introductory physics or even reasonably advanced physics, we can learn how to calculate it, we can learn how to realize what are the important variables in it, but it's something that's really not well understood. Even once you learn general relativity, if you do get there, I have to say, you can kind of say, oh, well, it's the warping of space time and all of this, but it's hard to get an intuition of why two objects, just because they have this thing called mass, they are attracted to each other. It's really, at least to me, a little bit mystical. But with that said, let's learn to deal with gravity. And we'll do that learning Newton's Law of Gravity, and this works for most purposes. So Newton's Law of Gravity says that the force between two masses, and that's the gravitational force, is equal to the gravitational constant G times the mass of the first object times the mass of the second object divided by the distance between the two objects squared. So that's simple enough. So let's play around with this, and see if we can get some results that look reasonably familiar to us. So let's use this formula to figure out what the acceleration, the gravitational acceleration, is at the surface of the Earth. So let's draw the Earth, just so we know what we're talking about. So that's my Earth. And let's say we want to figure out the gravitational acceleration on Sal. That's me. And so how do we apply this equation to figure out how much I'm accelerating down towards the center of Earth or the Earth's center of mass? The force is equal to-- so what's this big G thing? The G is the universal gravitational constant. Although, as far as I know, and I'm not an expert on this, I actually think its measurement can change. It's not truly, truly a constant, or I guess when on different scales, it can be a little bit different. But for our purposes, it is a constant, and the constant in most physics classes, is this: 6.67 times 10 to the negative 11th meters cubed per kilogram seconds squared. I know these units are crazy, but all you have to realize is these are just the units needed, that when you multiply it times a mass and a mass divided by a distance squared, you get Newtons, or kilogram meters per second squared. So we won't worry so much about the units right now. Just realize that you're going to have to work with meters in kilograms seconds. So let's just write that number down. I'll change colors to keep it interesting. 6.67 times 10 to the negative 11th, and we want to know the acceleration on Sal, so m1 is the mass of Sal. And I don't feel like revealing my mass in this video, so I'll just leave it as a variable. And then what's the mass 2? It's the mass of Earth. And I wrote that here. I looked it up on Wikipedia. This is the mass of Earth. So I multiply it times the mass of Earth, times 5.97 times 10 to the 24th kilograms-- weighs a little bit, not weighs, is a little bit more massive than Sal-- divided by the distance squared. Now, you might say, well, what's the distance between someone standing on the Earth and the Earth? Well, it's zero because they're touching the Earth. But it's important to realize that the distance between the two objects, especially when we're talking about the universal law of gravitation, is the distance between their center of masses. For all general purposes, my center of mass, maybe it's like three feet above the ground, because I'm not that tall. It's probably a little bit lower than that, actually. Anyway, my center of mass might be three feet above the ground, and where's Earth's center of mass? Well, it's at the center of Earth, so we have to know the radius of Earth, right? So the radius of Earth is-- I also looked it up on Wikipedia-- 6,371 kilometers. How many meters is that? It's 6 million meters, right? And then, you know, the extra meter to get to my center of mass, we can ignore for now, because it would be .001, so we'll ignore that for now. So it's 6-- and soon. I'll write it in scientific notation since everything else is in scientific notation-- 6.371 times 10 to the sixth meters, right? 6,000 kilometers is 6 million meters. So let's write that down. So the distance is going to be 6.37 times 10 to the sixth meters. We have to square that. Remember, it's distance squared. So let's see if we can simplify this a little bit. Let's just multiply those top numbers first. Force is equal to-- let's bring the variable out. Mass of Sal times-- let's do this top part. So we have 6.67 times 5.97 is equal to 39.82. And I just multiplied this times this, so now I have to multiply the 10's. So 10 to the negative 11th times 10 to the negative 24th. We can just add the exponents. They have the same base. So what's 24 minus 11? It's 10 to the 13th, right? And then what does the denominator look like? It's going to be the 6.37 squared times 10 to the sixth squared. So it's going to be-- whatever this is is going to be like 37 or something-- times-- what's 10 to the sixth squared? It's 10 to the 12th, right? 10 to the 12th. So let's figure out what 6.37 squared is. This little calculator I have doesn't have squared, so I have to-- so it's 40.58. And so simplifying it, the force is equal to the mass of Sal times-- let's divide, 39.82 divided by 40.58 is equal to 9.81. That's just this divided by this. And then 10 to the 13th divided by 10 to the 12th. Actually no, this isn't 9.81. Sorry, it's 0.981. 0.981, and then 10 to the 13th divided by 10 to the 12th is just 10, right? 10 to the first, times 10, so what's 0.981 times 10? Well, the force is equal to 9.81 times the mass of Sal. And where does this get us? How can we figure out the acceleration right now? Well, force is just mass times acceleration, right? So that's also going to just be equal to the acceleration of gravity-- that's supposed to be a small g there-- times the mass of Sal, right? So we know the gravitational force is 9.81 times the mass of Sal, and we also know that that's the same thing as the acceleration of gravity times the mass of Sal. We can divide both sides by the mass of Sal, and we have the acceleration of gravity. And if we had used the units the whole way, you would have seen that it is kilograms meters per second squared. And we have just shown that, at least based on the numbers that they've given in Wikipedia, the acceleration of gravity on the surface of the Earth is almost exactly what we've been using in all the projectile motion problems. It's 9.8 meters per second squared. That's exciting. So let's do another quick problem with gravity, because I've got two minutes. Let's say there's another planet called the planet Small Earth. And let's say the radius of Small Earth is equal to 1/2 the radius of Earth and the mass of Small Earth is equal to 1/2 the mass of Earth. So what's the pull of gravity on any object, say same object, on this? How much smaller would it be on this planet? Well, actually let me save that to the next video, because I hate being rushed. So I'll see you",science_physics_centripetal-force-and-gravitation
" -  What we're going to do in this video is talk about acidity and in particular, we're gonna talk about the pH scale. Now the first question is what does pH stand for and it turns out that there's some debate why we have this lowercase p here, we know why we have the h, and some people will tell you it stands for power of hydrogen, the capital h for hydrogen. Some people will say it's the potential of hydrogen. Some people will say it's the capacity for hydrogen, you might say capacity doesn't start with a p but if you go into Latin, it can. But what do all of these things mean and why do we care about hydrogen so much? Well, it turns out that hydrogen, and in particular, a hydrogen positive ion, and ion is just a positively charged molecule, that a hydrogen ion can play a major role in how acidic or basic something is. And so the pH scale, you're gonna see it go from zero all the way to 14 with of course, seven in the middle, and something that is towards the left, something that is less than seven is considered acidic, and so if you have a pH near zero that is highly, highly, highly acidic, while something to the right is considered basic and something in the middle is considered neutral. And another term for basic you'll sometimes see is alkaline, and alkaline actually comes from Arabic for alkali which was the word that ancient Arab chemists use for a compound that happens to be very basic by our modern definition. But what does it mean to be acidic and what does it mean to be basic and once again, how does that connect with hydrogen ions? Well, it turns out, and I'm not gonna go in depth in this video, is that things that are acidic tend to have lots of hydrogen ions and while things that are basic tend to react, react with these hydrogen ions. There's other definitions for what it means to be an acid or base and we'll go into depth in chemistry class on that, but this is why it's connected with the term pH. Now what are examples of things that are acidic? Well, you see it on this chart right over here. Here, we're going in the vertical direction. Things in our everyday life that are quite acidic, a lot of fruits are quite acidic, for example, lemons and grapefruits and orange juice are quite acidic. They're at the low end of the scale. And some of the telltale signs for acidity is if you were to drink it or eat it, that it would have this kind of sharp sour taste to it, while if you go to the other end of the spectrum, things that are basic, these would be things like bleaches and ammonia solution and we can even go super basic to liquid drain cleaner, and these are going to have more of a slimy texture to it. In fact, even soap is quite basic. And of the basic things that you could eat, you might have a bitter taste associated with it. But to be clear, I really don't recommend eating or drinking anything that is either highly basic or highly acidic, and the reason is is that things that are at the extreme of the pH scale, so things that are either extremely basic or things that are extremely acidic like battery acid or hydrochloric acid, because they're so reactive, they will damage you. If you pour it in your skin, it will damage you. If you ingest it, it will damage your cells and it can even kill you. So don't try to taste things to see whether they're acid or basic, and if you do, try to make sure that they're closer to this middle range of our pH scale. So I've talked a lot about things that are acidic or basic, but also what's interesting is things that we consider to be neutral. So our blood, for example, is quite neutral, and this is something that doctors might measure because if your pH in your blood gets a little bit too high or a little bit too low, that can cause some serious problems. Sea water is pretty close to being neutral. Milk is not that far off of being neutral. Now with that said, in order to read the pH scale appropriately or appreciate the differences in acidity and basicity, it's important to realize that it is not a linear scale. So for example, something that has a pH of eight is not twice as basic as something that has a pH of four. It turns out, when you go form one level of our pH scale to the other, you are going up in basicity, say going from a pH four to a pH of five, by a factor of 10. And so, comparing something with a pH of four to a pH of eight, that thing with the pH of four would be 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000 times more acidic, or you could say the thing with a pH of eight is 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000 times more basic. So I'll leave you there. Keep a lookout when people talk about pH balance or blood pH, and we're also, as we study more and more biology, we're gonna talk about how pH might influence some biological reactions and especially once you get into chemistry, pH will inform us what type of reaction is likely to happen.",science_in-in-class-10-chemistry-india_in-in-acids-bases-and-salts
" -  Nth derivative of g at x equals zero is given by, so the nth derivative of g evaluated x equals zero is equal to square root of n plus seven over n to the third for n is greater than or equal to one. What is the coefficient for the term containing x squared in the Maclaurin series of g? Let's just think about the Maclaurin series for g. If I were to have my function g of x. The Maclaurin series, I could say approximately equal to especially if I'm not gonna list out all of the terms, is going to be equal to, well it's going to be equal to g of zero plus g prime of zero times x plus g prime prime of zero divided by, I could say two factorial but that's just two, times x squared, and that's about as far as we go. Because we just have to think about what is the coefficient for the term containing x squared. If they said what's the coefficient for the term containing x to the third, I would keep going. I'd go g prime. I would take the third derivative evaluated at zero over three factorial. I could do this as a factorial too, but that just evaluates to two. I could do this as one factorial. I could do this as zero factorial just so you see it's a consistent idea here. I could, of course, keep on going, but we just care about, they're just asking us what is the coefficient for the term containing x squared? They just want us to figure out this. What is this thing right over here? To know that, we need to figure out what is the second derivative of g evaluated x equals zero? Well they tell us that over here. It's a little bit unconventional where they give us a formula, a general formula for any derivative evaluated x equals zero, but that's what they're telling us here. So in this case, the n isn't zero. The n is the derivative we're taking, and that's going to be our second derivative, so this is, so if I wanted to figure out g. If I am figuring out the second derivative, and I could write it like that evaluated zero, or I could write it like this just so the notation is consistent. I could write it like that. The second derivative evaluated x equals zero is going to be equal to, well our n is two, so this is going to be the square root of two plus seven over two to the third power. Two plus seven is nine, take the principle root of that. It's gonna give us positive three over two to the third which is eight, so this part right over here is 3/8, so the whole coefficient is going to be 3/8, that's this numerator, divided by, divided by two. Which of course is equal to 3/16, and we're done. They didn't want us to figure out a couple of terms of this which we could call the Maclaurin polynomial and nth degree Maclaurin polynomial. They didn't want us to find the entire, you know, keep going with this series. They just wanted to find one coefficient right here. The coefficient on the second degree term which we just figured out is 3/16.",math_ap-calculus-bc_bc-series-new
" In this video I'm going to work through the exact same scenario that we saw in the last video but it will be a little bit more mathy. The reason why I'm going to make it a little bit more mathy is so that you see it's a same idea it's just going to have a little bit more cryptic notation but it allows us to generalize the ideas that we saw in the last video. Let's just assume, instead of saying that the marginal propensity to consume in our little island is .6, let's just say our marginal propensity to consume is C. What we want to do is we want to figure out, given some initial change in expenditure and this guy's change in expenditure will be this guy's change in income. That cycle is round and round due to the multiplier effect. What is going to be the total change in our GDP? This is what we care about, we care about our total change in the GDP. Y could be viewed as expenditure or it could be viewed as income depending on how you think about things. Let's say this guy, instead of saying that's he's going to spend all in the thousand dollars, let's just call his incremental change in expenditure, let's just call that delta Y nought. Delta just means change in, and Y, we could view this as aggregate expenditure. I'm putting this little zero here. This is our first iteration, this is the first time that we're doing one these deltas. Then as we keep doing them we're going to have Y1, Y2, Y3 and so on and so forth. If we think about the total change in GDP, you're definitely going to have this. In the last example this was $1000. This guy is $1000 expenditures, this guy is a $1000 income. Then you have delta Y nought. Then we saw that this guy, his marginal propensity to consume is C. He's going to spend of the income he gets, he's going to spend C times that. He's now going to do Delta Y1. This is the next incremental bump in our GDP we're seeing and that's going to be equal to C times what he just got. Now, after doing the zero iteration in the first iteration our total change is going to be ... Actually let me write it this way, times delta Y1, and delta Y1, this is just the same thing as C x delta Y nought. It's fancy notation but it's just saying something fairly basic, The exact same thing that we said in the last video. Now this guy, all of a sudden, above and beyond what he spent in that zeroth iteration, he's now getting delta Y1. He has a marginal propensity to consume, we're just assuming of C. Now he is going to spend C times that. He's now going to make an expenditure of, I'll do this just in the same color, he's now going to do delta Y2 which is equal to C x delta Y1. Now we have delta Y2, this new incremental bump and they're getting smaller and smaller and smaller but we can go an infinite number of times. Just to remember what this is, delta Y2 is the same thing as C x delta Y1. Delta Y1 is the same thing as C x delta Y nought. So this thing right over here, this whole thing could be written as C^2 x delta Y nought. This right over here C x delta Y nought. This of course is equal to, this is just delta Y nought. We can just keep going. If this guy would then get this amount and he'll spent C times that to the farmer and so if we had a Y3, it would just amount to C times this which is C^3 x delta Y nought and we could keep going on and on and on an infinite number of time but each of these terms are going to smaller and smaller because we're going to assume, in order for this to actually work, we're going to assume that C is between 0 and 1. Obviously, when someone gets new income and thinking of the simple case, someone is not going to spend more, the marginal propensity to consume, they can't spend more than they just got. In general they're not going to spend the whole thing. So we're going to assume that it is less than 1. This is exactly the same idea that we did in the last one but now it is general and we can simplify this a little bit mathematically. This is all equal to our delta Y, our total bump in GDP due to that initial spark. If we factor that initial spark out with the delta Y nought. Actually, let me do that in different color just so the math becomes clear. We have the delta Y nought, delta Y nought, delta Y nought, delta Y nought. When I say nought, I'm talking about that zero subscript. If we factor that our, we get our total bump in GDP. Whether you want to do this output, expenditure or income, is equal to, we're going to factor that out, the delta Y nought times, and then we're just left with, you factor the change in Y nought here you get 1 and then over here, + C + C^2 + C^3 and you go on and on and on. In the last video I told you that this right over here is going to simplify to 1 over 1 - C. This is equal to, this part over here is equal to 1 over 1 - C. Now, you might have not been satisfied and since this is a more mathy video it's a good place to actually show you that it would sum up to 1 over 1 - C. Not to introduce too many variables, but let's just call this thing X. Let's just say that X is equal to this whole thing right over here. It's equal 1 + C + C^2 + C^3, so on and so forth. Now let's imagine what we would get if we multiply X x C. What happens if I multiply, and I'll do this in a different color. What happens if I multiply C x X? Well then, each of these terms I can multiply by C. 1 x C is C, C x C is C^2, C^2 x C is C^3, C^3 x C is C^4, so on and so forth. Now, what happens if I subtract this from that? If I subtract the left hand sides I get X - CX on the left hand side. I'll do that in that pink color. Where did it go? Actually I think I changed the color on my ... I'll just write X - CX and that's going to be equal to, if you subtract this stuff from that stuff over there, you have a C - C, they'll cancel out. Let me do this in yellow. C^2 - C^2, that will cancel out. C^3 - C^3, that would cancel out. Every term other than 1 is going to cancel out. Everything is going to cancel out and you're just going to be left with the 1 here which is a pretty neat trick in my mind. Then we can factor out the X right over here. You get X x 1 - C = 1 and then you divide both sides by 1 - C, you get X = 1 over 1 - C. X was exactly this thing right over here. This thing is equal to 1 over 1 - C. This right here, we just showed you exactly what we told you in the last video that the total bump in GDP, this right over here, you could view this as the total bump in GDP is going to be equal to that initial bump in GDP which we called delta Y nought. That was that initial spending that that farmer did and the builders initial income, that the total bump is going to be equal to that initial bump times this expression which we view as the multiplier. This is the multiplier right here is a function of the marginal propensity to consume. This right over here, let me label it all. Actually, let me just rewrite it. The total bump in our aggregate expenditure or output or income is going to be equal to the initial bump times the multiplier which ends up being a function of our marginal propensity to consume. This right over here is our multiplier and this right over here is, you could view that as our initial bump. Just to make sure that it works out from what we saw in the last video. In the last video our marginal propensity to consume was .6. C was 0.6 and our initial bump, our initial expenditure was equal to 1,000. If you put .6 in here you will get 2.5 and so you get the exact same multiplier and you get the exact same total bump in GDP as we got in the last video. At least now we have a little general and you're hopefully a little bit more comfortable with some of these notation that I'm using. Unfortunately, you'll see different notation almost every economics textbook. I just want to make sure that this makes reasonable sense to you.",economics-finance-domain_macroeconomics_aggregate-supply-demand-topic
" Based on what we've done in the last 2 videos we've been able to figure out what the marginal revenue curve looks like for the monopolist year, for the monopolist in the orange market and this is what we got. Right over here, it was a line with a slope twice as steep as the slope of the demand curve, we'll see that's actually generalizable. There's an optional video that I'll do very shortly where I prove it with a little bit of calculus. It's very important to realize that this marginal revenue curve looks very different than the marginal revenue curve if we were dealing with perfect competition. If we were dealing with perfect competition there would be some equilibrium price in the market and all of the competitors would essentially just have to take that price. Let's say that that equilibrium price was $3 per pound then our marginal revenue curve would look like this if we were not a monopolist, if we were one of the many perfect competitors. I guess you could view it that way. Because we would just have to take that price. If we wanted to sell 1000 pounds, each of those pounds we would get $3 per pound and then if we want to sell 1001, we'll just get $3 per pound for the next one. It doesn't change. We're just taking that price. With the monopolist things do change because we are the only producer in the market. The price at which we can get changes depending on what we produce because we are the entire supply for the market and we have this downward sloping marginal revenue curve. Now, with that out of the way, let's think about what will be the optimal quantity for us to produce if we wanted to maximize profit? If we think in pure economic terms, that's what firms try to do. They exist to maximise profit. To do that, we're going to have to think about, and remember, it's not to maximize revenue. To maximize revenue we would have said, ""Oh, they should just produce 3000 pounds."" It's not about maximizing revenue, it's about maximizing profit. We have to take the cost into consideration. To do that, we'll have to draw a marginal cost curve. Let's say I did the research. Let's say we're the owners of this firm and we have a marginal cost curve that looks something like this. Let's say our marginal cost curve looks like this. It's important to realize, we are the market. We are the only producers here. This isn't just our marginal cost curve. This is a marginal cost curve for the market. Another way to think about it, this is the supply curve for the market. It tells you at any given price how much the market is willing to supply. You could view it as a marginal cost or you could view it as a supply curve and we've talked about it before. You could view a supply curve as a marginal cost curve. If you want the market to produce 1 extra pound, what's the minimum price you would have to give? that is the marginal cost. Now, with this out of the way, let's think about what you would produce. Well, you would definitely want to produce something you definitely start to produce a few pounds right over here because the marginal revenue you're getting is way above your marginal cost. Each incremental pound you're producing right over here, you're getting much more revenue, you're getting $5 or $6 of revenue and it's only costing you a little over a dollar. It's like, ""Okay, I'm going to keep producing. ""I'm going to keep producing."" Over here, you're still, each incremental unit you're getting, you're still getting more revenue than the cost of that incremental unit. That keeps being true all the way until you get to 2000 pounds right over here. At this point right over here you don't want to produce an incremental unit because if you produce one more unit, if you produce that 2001st pound right over here then for that 2001st pound, your cost is going to be slightly higher than the revenue you get in. You will actually take a slight loss on that. Your total profit will start to go down and you don't want to produce less than this because you'll be leaving a little money on the table. You'll be leaving that little incremental pound where the total revenue was just slightly higher, or the marginal revenue on that incremental pound was just slightly higher than your marginal cost on that incremental pound. You will produce right over there. Now, this is interesting because this is a different equilibrium, or I guess we say this is a different price or this is a different price and quantity than we would get if we were dealing with perfect competition. If we were dealing with perfect competition, our equilibrium price and quantity would be where our supply and demand curves intersect. It would be right over here. It would be a price of $3 per pound and a quantity of 3000 pounds. Now, in order to maximize profit, we are intersecting between the marginal revenue curve or our quantity that we want to produce as the monopolist is the intersection between our marginal revenue curve and our marginal cost curve which is right over here. So we can see that there is a dead weight loss. There is a dead weight loss by being a monopoly although it's good for us. It's good for the monopolist, it's not good for a society at least in this example and there's very few where I can imagine it being good but I guess there are a few if you're trying to protect the national industry or something like that. Over here, this is the quantity that we are deciding to produce. The consumer surplus is the area above the price and below the demand curve. This right over here is the consumer surplus. The producer surplus is looking pretty good and this is essentially what we're trying to optimize. Our producer surplus is this whole area. Our producer surplus is this whole area right over here. Producer surplus right over there. But we have a dead weight cost. There's a total surplus that we would have gotten, that society would have gotten if we were dealing with perfect competition, right over here that's now being lost. But as we lose that, we were able to increase the producer surplus and decrease the consumer surplus. Beyond just having this dead weight loss over here, it's also obviously given much more value to the producer, to the monopolist and given much less value to the consumer.",economics-finance-domain_ap-microeconomics_imperfect-competition
" -  So we have here the square root, the principal root, of one two-hundredth. And what I want to do is simplify this. When I say ""simplify it"" I really mean, if there's any perfect squares here that I can factor out to take it out from under the radical. And so I encourage you to pause the video and see if you can do that. Alright so there's a couple of ways that you could approach this. One way is to say, Well this is going to be the same thing as the square root of one over the square root of 200. The square root of one is just one over the square root of 200. And there's a couple of ways to try to simplify the square root of 200. I'll do it a couple of ways here. Square root of 200. You could realize that, OK, look 100 is a perfect square. And it goes into 200. So this is the same thing as two times 100. And so the square root of 200 is the square root of two times 100, which is the same thing as the square root of two times the square root of 100. And we know that the square root of 100 is 10. So it's the square root of two times 10 or we could write this as 10 square roots of two. That's one way to approach it. But if it didn't jump out at you immediately that you have this large perfect square that is a factor of 200, you could just start with small numbers. You could say, alright, let me do this alternate method in a different color. You could say, ah it's the same color that I've been doing before. (laughing) You could say that the square root of 200, say Well it's divisible by two. So it's two times 100. And if 100 didn't jump out at you as a perfect square, you could say, Well that's just going to be two times 50. Well I can still divide two into that. That's two times 25. Let's see, and 25, if that doesn't jump out at you as a perfect square, you could say that that's not divisible by two, not divisible by three, four, but it is divisible by five. That is five times five. And to identify the perfect squares you would say, Alright, are there any factors where I have at least two of them? Well I have two times two here. And I also have five times five here. So I can rewrite the square root of 200 as being equal to the square root of two times two. Let me just write it all out. Actually I think I'm going to run out of space. So the square root, give myself more space under the radical, square root of two times two times five times five times two. And I wrote it in this order so you can see the perfect squares here. Well this is going to be the same thing as the square root of two times two. This second method is a little bit more monotonous, but hopefully you see that it works, (laughing) I guess is one way to think about it. And they really, they boil down to the same method. We're still going to get to the same answer. So square root of two times two times the square root times the square root of five times five, times the square root of two. Well the square root of two times two is just going to be, this is just two. Square root of five times five, well that's just going to be five. So you have two times five times the square root of two, which is 10 times the square root of two. So this right over here, square root of 200, we can rewrite as 10 square roots of two. So this is going to be equal to one over 10 square roots of two. Now some people don't like having a radical in the denominator and if you wanted to get rid of that, you could multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the square root of two. 'Cause notice we're just multiplying by one, we're expressing one as square root of two over square root of two, and then what that does is we rewrite this as the square root of two over 10 times the square root of two times the square root of two. Well the square root of two times the square root of two is just going to be two. So it's going to be 10 times two which is 20. So it could also be written like that. So hopefully you found that helpful. In fact, even this one, you could write if you want to visualize it slightly differently, you could view it as one twentieth times the square root of two. So these are all the same thing.",math_algebra-home_alg-exp-and-log
" -  We are now going to discuss price elasticity of demand, which sounds like a very fancy concept, but really, it's a way for economists to sense how sensitive is quantity to change in prices. And in this video, we're gonna denote it as a capital E, so E, price elasticity of demand. And the easy way to think about it is it is your percent change in, I'll use the Greek letter delta as shorthand for change in here, percent change in quantity over your percent change in price. And so, you might say, wait, how does this relate to the everyday idea of elasticity? Well, imagine two bands. So, let's imagine an inelastic band, inelastic, right over here, and let's imagine an elastic band right over here. So, in an inelastic band, if we apply some amount of force, you're not going to be able to stretch it much, it might stretch a little bit, while an elastic band, if you apply that same amount of force, you might be able to stretch it a lot more. And so, the analogy here is we're not using force, but we're saying how much does quantity stretch for a given amount of price change? And so, something where the quantity changes a lot for a given price change would be very elastic. So, this, the magnitude of this will be larger. And if the percent change in quantity doesn't change a lot for a our given percent change in price, well, then we're dealing with an inelastic price elasticity of demand. And we'll be able to internalize these more as we work through the numbers. And actually, let's do that for this demand schedule that we have right over here, and it's visualized as our demand curve. In the vertical axis, we have price of burgers; and then in our horizontal axis, we have quantity, in terms of burgers per hour. And so, let's just use this definition of price elasticity of demand to calculate it across different points on our demand curve. So, I'm gonna make a new column here, so price elasticity of demand. And the way I'm gonna do it is really the simplest method for calculating this. In other videos, we can go into more in-depth methods, like the midpoint method. And I'll show you the weakness in what we're doing right here. But for the sake of, say, an AP economics, microeconomics course, this would be sufficient. So, let's think about our price elasticity of demand as we go from point A to point B. Well, remember, that's just going to be our percent change in quantity over our percent change in price. So, what is our percent change in quantity? Well, we're starting at a quantity of two, so I'll put that in our denominator. And we're going from two to four, so we are adding two. So, we have two over two, we could multiply that times 100% if we like. So, this would give us, we have 100% change in quantity over, now what was the corresponding change in price, percent change in price? So, our corresponding percent change in price, our initial price is nine, and we go from nine to eight, so we're going down by one. And then we multiply that times 100%. So, this is going to be about a negative 11% change in price. And this math is reasonably straightforward because the 100%s cancel out, this is just a one. One over negative 1/9 is just going to be equal to negative nine. So, you have a negative nine price elasticity of demand. So, before I interpret that more, let's look at the price elasticity of demand at other points, or starting from other points to other points on this curve. So, let's think about it going from, actually let's think about it going from E to F. So, as we go from E to F, we're going to do the same exact exercise. What is our percent change in quantity? Well, our initial quantity is 16. And we're going from 16 to 18, so we have a change of two. So, two over 16 times 100%, that is our percent change in quantity. And what is our percent change in price? Well, our initial price is two. And we're going from two to one, so we have a price change of negative one times 100%. And so, what you see here is this is 1/8 times 100%, this would be 12.5% up here. So, this is 12.5% up there, and then this, over here, is going to be negative 50%. So, when price went down by 50%, you had a 12.5% increase in quantity. 12.5% is 1/4 of 50%, so this is going to give us a price elasticity of demand of negative 0.25. So, there's a couple of interesting things that you might already be realizing. One is even though our demand curve right over here is a line, it actually has a constant slope, you see that the price elasticity of demand changes, depending on different parts of the curve. Now, the reason why this is, is really just boils down to math. When we're going from A to B, our initial prices were relatively high. So, even though you had a price decrease of one, it was from an initial price of nine. So, your percentage change in price looked fairly low, while your percentage change in quantity was high 'cause you're going from a low quantity of two, and you're adding two to it, so you had 100% change in quantity. When you go to the other end our curve, and you go from E to F, it's the other way around. Your price starting point is low, so your percent change in price, when you decrease price by one, it looks like a fairly large magnitude; while your percent change in quantity when you go from E to F because you are already at a quantity of 16, adding two to that is not that large of a percentage. Now, another thing you might be appreciating is if we tried to calculate the price elasticity of demand up here on the curve, and instead of going from A to B, if we went from B to A, we would've gotten a different value because our initial prices and quantities would have been different. Our initial price, we would've put an eight right over here, and our initial quantity, we would've put a four over here, and we would've gotten a different value. And that's one of the negatives of the technique, which is arguably the simplest technique, that I just used. There's other techniques, like the midpoint technique, that can give you a more consistent result, whether you're going from A to B or B to A, but I won't cover it just yet. But let's think, now, about how to interpret this. And the best way to interpret it is to think about the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand. So, over here, the absolute value of our price elasticity of demand is equal to nine, and then, over here, the absolute value of our price elasticity of demand is equal to 0.25. And a general rule of thumb is if your absolute value of your price elasticity of demand is less than one, you are dealing with an inelastic, inelastic, elastic situation; and if your price elasticity of demand, the absolute value of it, is greater than one, you're dealing with an elastic situation. Why does that make sense? Well, in this first scenario, it's saying for a given percentage change in price, you have a smaller percent change in quantity; while here, for a given percent in price, you're going to have a larger than that percentage change in your quantity. So, once again, it goes back to these rubber band analogies. So, when we're going from A to B, the absolute value of our price elasticity of demand is definitely larger than one. So, economists would consider this to be an elastic situation; while when we go from point E to point F, our price elasticity of demand, or the absolute value of it, is definitely less than one, so this going to be an inelastic situation.",economics-finance-domain_ap-microeconomics_unit-2-supply-and-demnd
" -  When you picture someone treating depression, and maybe when you think about therapy more generally, you might picture something like the scene here. Someone lying on a couch discussing their problems while a bearded serious therapist, who happens to look a lot like Freud, listens and takes notes and maybe occasionally gives the patient some kind of insight. But this is an overly simplistic picture of psychological therapies, which can actually be really diverse. But before I talk about specific ones, I want to note two things about all psychological therapies. The first is that therapists go through years of training to get where they are, so chances are they have helped individuals with depression in the past. The second thing is that the therapist doesn't know you. They aren't personally invested in you or your problems. Both of these things making talking to a therapist very different from talking with a family member or a friend. The first type of therapy I want to talk about here is also the oldest, and that's psychodynamic therapy. This is the type of therapy that looks most like that couch picture from before. It is based on the idea that depression is caused by a loss in a person's life, either a real one or a symbolic one. This loss could also be conscious or unconscious. The goal of this type of therapy is to give a person insight into their thoughts and behaviors. In doing so they can help them find the root of their depression, the symbolic loss in their life that lead to their current depressive state. They do this by talking, not necessarily about their problems, but about anything that comes to their mind at that moment. The job of the therapist is to guide that discussion, to focus their attention on certain details. This therapy is meant to be continued long term, because as it turns out it can take a long time to shift through and identify unconscious causes. But unfortunately this type of therapy is generally not effective in treating depression. Another thing that I want to focus on is the term ""psychotherapy,"" because we have Freudian psychotherapy, that's what we've been talking about here, but these days the term psychotherapy is generally used as an umbrella term for many different therapies, some of them really effective. Although these may look different from traditional psychotherapy, they all do use it as a base. One example of a modern form of psychotherapy is called ""inter-personal therapy,"" it's also known as IPT. The idea behind this type of psychotherapy is that social networks and social support can kind of act as a buffer against depression. IPT focuses on helping people be more aware of their social networks. Specifically it's goal is to help people be more aware of the ways that their actions might be preventing them from maintaining close social relationships with those around them. The goal is to help the individual with depression improve these social relationships as a means to decrease their depressive symptoms. Unlike traditional psychotherapy, this type of therapy is meant to be short term. It focuses on strategies rather than discussing the past and looking for insights. Instead of lying on a couch and talking about their relationship with their mother, they might talk about ways to reconnect with their mother. It's much more action oriented. The next therapy that I want to talk about is behavioral therapy, and behaviorism in general does away with hidden concepts like the unconscious. Instead it focuses on people's behaviors. As it relates to depression, the ideas is that depression stops a person's energy and makes them withdraw from their social contexts. A combination of these two things reduces a person's access to pleasurable activities, so all of the things that they once enjoyed doing. Because they are no longer going out and having fun, this reinforces their negative mood. The goal of behavioral therapy is to focus on strategies instead of thinking about the past. But rather than focusing on ways to fix relationships like IPT, the goal of behavioral therapy is to get the person out of the house and back to the activities that they once enjoyed. By increasing social contact with friends and family and by forcing the individual to engage in activities that they once found pleasurable, even if they don't find them pleasurable now, they will eventually feel better. Through repetition they will eventually begin to enjoy them again. This therapy, which is short term, let me write that down, this therapy is actually quite effective. It turns out that going through the motions really does make people feel better over time. But one problem with this style of therapy is that people find it really hard. People with depression might find taking part in these activities to be really stressful and really intimidating. Another problem is that people don't start feeling better right away, it isn't spontaneous. In fact, it can be a few weeks before they see improvement, before they start enjoying these activities again. Because of this, some individuals might have a hard time sticking with it. If behavioral therapy is more focused on changing people's behaviors, cognitive therapy is about changing people's thoughts. The idea behind this theory is that how we feel is largely a factor of how we think about the world and how we interpret the world around us. Over time people develop automatic negative thoughts and irrational assumptions. Imagine a person going around thinking to themselves, ""I am worthless."" Think about how thinking about that statement and repeating it over and over might contribute to depression. Think about how it might affect how this person acts, how they perceive the world. Both of these things, both automatic thoughts and irrational assumptions, drive our behavior and shape our experiences, even if we're not consciously aware of it. In practice, cognitive therapy has two parts. The first is to challenge these automatic thoughts and irrational assumptions, and the next is to change them. More specifically, to show the individual that they have the ability to change them, to show them that these thoughts are actually under their control. Because it's action-oriented, this type of therapy tends to be short term. There are some problems with this style of therapy. The main one is that depends a lot on the individual with depression. The therapist can act as a guide, but it is really the individual with depression who needs to make it work. That can be somewhat challenging for individuals who believe that their symptoms are a part of them and who don't believe that they have the power to do anything about them. But that said, cognitive therapy can be really effective for individuals who are active participants. The last kind of therapy I want to talk about in this video is cognitive behavioral therapy. As you can probably tell by the name, this therapy is a combination of cognitive therapies and behavioral therapies. It's based on the idea that there is a reciprocal relationship between our thoughts, our feelings, and our behaviors. Notice that I have drawn all of these arrows as being two-sided. Here we're saying someone has a negative thought, ""I am worthless,"" and this might lead them to not study for a test since they believe it's hopeless anyway, and then they feel upset when they fail. Or maybe they forget when an assignment was due and this leads them to think, ""I'm stupid,"" which then leads to a depressed mood, which then leads to them canceling plans with their friends and causes them to think, ""I am a terrible friend."" This could go on forever, and that's the main point here. CBT holds that all of these things are interconnected, and you can't really piece them apart. So if anything is really going to help an individual with depression, it needs to address both cognitions and behaviors. The goal of this therapy is to challenge people's negative schemas and change them while at the same time also encouraging them to be mindful of their behaviors and go back to being active participants in their life. Of the therapies that I've mentioned here, IPT and CBT are generally considered to be the most effective. Sometimes just as effective as medication. But I want to point out that this isn't an either/or kind of deal. In general the best outcomes tends to come from a combination of medicine and therapy.",science_health-and-medicine_mental-health
" -  ""Market researchers conducted a study ""comparing the salaries of managers ""at a large nationwide retail store. ""The researchers obtained salary ""and demographic data for a random sample of managers. ""The researchers calculated the average salary ""of the men in the sample and the average salary ""of the women in the sample. ""They want to test if managers who are men ""have a higher average salary than managers who are women. ""Assume that all conditions for inference have been met. ""Which of these is the most appropriate test ""and alternative hypothesis?"" And, we can see, they're talking about a paired T test and a two-sample T test, and then they talk about the alternative hypotheses. So, pause this video and try to figure this out on your own. So first, let's think about the difference between a paired T test and a two-sample T test. In a paired T test, we're gonna construct hypotheses around a parameter for our population that will often be the mean difference. So, we have one population, so we're talking about the paired situation right over here, and so, let's say we say, ""Hey, do people run faster when they wear shorts or pants?"", and so for each member of the population, you can see what you would, if you really had perfect information, you would know, how fast did they run with pants and how fast did they run with shorts? And then, you would calculate the difference, and then across the whole population, you could actually get that mean difference. So, the mean difference of pants minus shorts. And of course, in order to estimate that, or in order to do a hypothesis test around that, you would take a sample, and then you would calculate the sample mean of the difference of pants minus shorts, and then, you would say, ""Hey,"" assuming the null hypothesis is true, you would construct some null hypothesis, likely that there is no, that this mean is zero, and you would say, ""Hey, if the null hypothesis is true, ""that this is actually equal to zero, ""what's the probability that I got this result?"" If that's below your significance level, then you would reject your null hypothesis and it would suggest the alternative that might be that, ""Hey, maybe this mean ""is greater than zero."" On the other hand, a two-sample T test is where you're thinking about two different populations. For example, you could be thinking about a population of men, and you could be thinking about the population of women. And you wanna compare the means between these two, say, the mean salary. So, you have the mean salary for men and you have the mean salary for women, and what you're trying to do with the hypothesis test is try to come up with some conclusions about the mean difference between these two parameters. So, the mean salary for men minus the mean salary for women. And our null hypothesis is usually the no-news-here hypothesis, and so in this situation, our null hypothesis is that there is no difference between these means and that our alternative hypothesis in the situation that we are looking at, because they wanna test if managers who are men have a higher average salary. If they just wanted to test that whether managers who are men have a different salary, then our alternative hypothesis would look something like this, where the mean of men minus the mean of women is not equal to zero, but they aren't just testing to see if the means are different, they wanna see if men have a higher average salary. So, instead of not equal zero there, we would have greater than zero for our alternative hypothesis. So, which choice is that? Well, we're clearly in a two-sample T test situation, and we wanna do the greater than, not the not-equal-to, so we are in that choice, right over there.",math_ap-statistics_two-sample-inference
" - What we have here is a zoom-in of the surface of water. So up here you have the air, this is the air, these are some air molecules, maybe they're nitrogen molecules. They're fairly far apart, in fact, in reality, they would be even more far apart than this. And then over here you have water molecules. We've seen this many times. You have the oxygen atom and it's bonded to two hydrogen atoms, and the oxygen atom likes to hog the electrons more. It's more electronegative, so you have a partially negative charge at this end and partially positive ends at this end. And that attraction between the partially positive ends and the partially negative ends, that's what gives water all sorts of neat properties. Those are the hydrogen bonds. Those are the hydrogen bonds that give water all sorts of neat properties and keep it in its liquid state at a standard temperature and pressure. Now what I want to think about is the surface in particular. And if you look at the surface of water, it might look completely smooth. But if you were to zoom in on a molecular level, you'll see that, well, it's just made up of these molecules. But roughly speaking, roughly speaking, let's just say that this is roughly the surface, the surface of the water. The surface of the water. Now, what's going on at the surface? Well, all these molecules are interacting through hydrogen bonds. Let's say this molecule right over here, it has hydrogen bonds pulling on it upwards, up to this one, pulling it this way, pulling it downwards, pulling it in really, really, to some degree, almost every direction. And they all have their kinetic energy and they're bumping around, but they're flowing past each other. The hydrogen bonds are giving that cohesiveness. The molecules are attracted to each other. But if you look at the molecules on the surface, if you look at the ones on the surface, sure, they might have stuff pulling down on them, they might have stuff pulling them to the side, but they don't have anything pulling on them from above. And because of this, you could imagine that they're able to get a little bit more densely packed, that they're able to get a little closer to their neighbors. And this is what allows them to actually have a stronger, I guess you could say, intermolecular force at the surface than you have within the body, and that causes a phenomenon known as surface tension. So you have stronger, you have kind of a deeper, and this is still just hydrogen bonds, but since they're not being pulled in other directions by, upwards by the air, they're able to get a little bit more closely packed, a little bit tighter, and this we refer to as surface tension, surface tension. And you have probably observed surface tension many, many, many times in your life in the form of, say, a water droplet. A water droplet, it's able to have this roughly round shape because all the little water molecules on the surface of the water droplet, and here the surface might even be on the bottom of the water droplet. They are more attracted to each other than they are to the surrounding air, so they're able to form this type of a shape. You might've seen it if you go to a pond or a stream sometimes, so you see some still water. And let's say, let me do this in blue. So let's say that this is the surface of the water right over here. You might have seen insects that are able to walk on the surface of the water. And I'm not doing a great job at drawing the insects. They don't look exactly like that. But they can walk on the surface of the water. You might've seen or you might've even tried to do something like put a paperclip on the water. And even though this thing is actually more dense than the water and you might expect it to sink, but because of the surface tension, which really forms something of a film on top of the water, the thing won't penetrate the surface, so the paperclip will float, unless you were to push on it a little bit and it allow it to puncture the surface, and then it would actually sink, which is what you would expect because it is actually denser. You'd even see this if you were to take a cup, if you were to take a cup and you were to fill it all the way up to the rim and then a little bit higher, it won't immediately overflow. It won't immediately overflow. If you're very careful, you'll see that you form a bulge here. And that bulges because those individual water molecules are more attracted to each other than they are to the surrounding air. So that allows for something of a little bulge. Obviously if you keep pouring water, at some point, they're just gonna start overflowing because gravity's gonna take over there. Gravity's gonna overwhelm the surface tension. But this bulge will actually form. So surface tension, it is really due to the cohesion of the water. Remember, cohesion is when the molecules are attracted to each other. And it definitely, and especially because they're more attracted to each other than the surrounding air.",science_biology_water-acids-and-bases
"  In the last video we tried to figure out the slope of a point or the slope of a curve at a certain point. And the way we did, we said OK, well let's find the slope between that point and then another point that's not too far away from that point. And we got the slope of the secant line. And it looks all fancy, but this is just the y value of the point that's not too far away, and this is just the y value point of the point in question, so this is just your change in y. And then you divide that by your change in x. So in the example we did, h was the difference between our 2 x values. This distance was h. And that gave us the slope of that line. We said hey, what if we take the limit as this point right here gets closer and closer to this point. If this point essentially almost becomes this point, then our slope is going to be the slope of our tangent line. And we define that as the derivative of our function. We said that's equal to f prime of x. So let's if we can apply this in this video to maybe make things a little bit more concrete in your head. So let me do one. First I'll do a particular case where I want to find the slope at exactly some point. So let me draw my axes again. Let's draw some axes right there. Let's say I have the curve-- this is the curve-- y is equal to x squared. So this is my y-axis, this is my x-axis, and I want to know the slope at the point x is equal to 3. When I say the slope you can imagine a tangent line here. You can imagine a tangent line that goes just like that, and it would just barely graze the curve at that point. But what is the slope of that tangent line? What is the slope of that tangent line which is the same as the slope of the curve right at that point. So to do it, I'm actually going to do this exact technique that we did before, then we'll generalize it so you don't have to do it every time for a particular number. So let's take some other point here.  Let's call this 3 plus delta x. I'm changing the notation because in some books you'll see an h, some books you'll see a delta x, doesn't hurt to be exposed to both of them. So this is 3 plus delta x. So first of all what is this point right here? This is a curve y is equal to x squared, so f of x is 3 squared-- this is the point 9. This is the point 3,9 right here.  And what is this point right here? So if we were go all the way up here, what is that point? Well here our x is 3 plus delta x. It's the same thing as this one right here, as x naught plus h. I could have called this 3 plus h just as easily. So it's 3 plus delta x up there. So what's the y value going to be? Well whatever x value is, it's on the curve, it's going to be that squared. So it's going to be the point 3 plus delta x squared. So let's figure out the slope of this secant line.  And let me zoom in a little bit, because that might help. So if I zoom in on just this part of the curve, it might look like that. And then I have one point here, and then I have the other point is up here.  That's the secant line.  Just like that. This was the point over here, the point 3,9. And then this point up here is the point 3 plus delta x, so just some larger number than 3, and then it's going to be that number squared. So it's going to be 3 plus delta x squared. What is that? That's going to be 9. I'm just foiling this out, or you do the distribute property twice. a plus b squared is a squared plus 2 a b plus b squared, so it's going to be 9 plus two times the product of these things. So plus 6 delta x, and then plus delta x squared.  That's the coordinate of the second line. This looks complicated, but I just took this x value and I squared it, because it's on the line y is equal to x squared. So the slope of the secant line is going to be the change in y divided by the change in x. So the change in y is just going to be this guy's y value, which is 9 plus 6 delta x plus delta x squared. That's this guy's y value, minus this guy's y value.  So minus 9. That's your change in y. And you want to divide that by your change in x. Well what is your change in x? This is actually going to be pretty convenient. This larger x value-- we started with this point on the top, so we have to start with this point on the bottom. So it's going to be 3 plus delta x. And then what's this x value? What is minus 3? That's his x value. So what does this simplify to? The numerator-- this 9 and that 9 cancel out, we get a 9 minus 9. And in the denominator what happens? This 3 and minus 3 cancel out. So the change in x actually end up becoming this delta x, which makes sense, because this delta x is essentially how much more this guy is then that guy. So that should be the change in x, delta x. So the slope of my secant line has simplified to 6 times my change in x, plus my change in x squared, all of that over my change in x. And now we can simplify this even more. Let's divide the numerator and the denominator by our change in x. And I'll switch colors just to ease the monotony. So my slope of my tangent of my secant line-- the one that goes through both of these-- is going to be equal if you divide the numerator and denominator this becomes 6. I'm just dividing numerator and denominator by delta x plus six plus delta x. So that is the slope of this secant line So slope is equal to 6 plus delta x. That's this one right here. That's this reddish line that I've drawn right there. So this number right here, if the delta x was one, if these were the points 3 and 4, then my slope would be 6 plus 1, because I'm picking a point 4 where the delta x here would have to be 1. So the slope would be 7. So we have a general formula for no matter what my delta x is, I can find the slow between 3 and 3 plus delta x. Between those two points. Now we wanted to find the slope at exactly that point right there. So let's see what happens when delta x get smaller and smaller. This is what delta x is right now. It's this distance. But if delta x got a little bit smaller, then the secant line would look like that. Got even smaller, the secant line would look like that, it gets even smaller. Then we're getting pretty close to the slope of the tangent line. The tangent line is this thing right here that I want to find the slope of. Let's find a limit as our delta x approaches 0. So the limit as delta x approaches 0 of our slope of the secant line of 6 plus delta x is equal to what? This is pretty straightforward. You can just set this equal to 0 and it's equal to 6. So the slope of our tangent line at the point x is equal to 3 right there is equal to 6. And another way we could write this if we wrote that f of x is equal to x squared. We now know that the derivative or the slope of the tangent line of this function at the point 3-- I just only evaluated it at the point 3 right there-- that that is equal to 6. I haven't yet come up with a general formula for the slope of this line at any point, and I'm going to do that in the next video. ",math_old-differential-calculus_derivative-intro-dc
" Let's now tackle a classic thought experiment in probability, called the Monte Hall problem. And it's called the Monty Hall problem because Monty Hall was the game show host in Let's Make a Deal, where they would set up a situation very similar to the Monte Hall problem that we're about to say. So let's say that on the show, you're presented with three curtains. So you're the contestant, this little chef-looking character right over there. You're presented with three curtains-- curtain number one, curtain number two, and curtain number three. And you're told that behind one of these three curtains, there's a fabulous prize, something that you really want, a car, or a vacation, or some type of large amount of cash. And then behind the other two, and we don't know which they are, there is something that you do not want. A new pet goat or an ostrich or something like that, or a beach ball, something that is not as good as the cash prize. And so your goal is to try to find the cash prize. And they say guess which one, or which one would you like to select? And so let's say that you select door number one, or curtain number one. Then the Monte Hall and Let's Make a Deal crew will make it a little bit more interesting. They want to show you whether or not you won. They'll then show you one of the other two doors, or one of the other two curtains. And they'll show you one of the other two curtains that does not have the prize. And no matter which one you pick, there'll always be at least one other curtain that does not have the prize. There might be two, if you picked right. But there will always be at least one other curtain that does not have the prize. And then they will show it to you. And so let's say that they show you curtain number three. And so curtain number three has the goat. And then they'll ask you, do you want to switch to curtain number two? And the question here is, does it make a difference? Are you better off holding fast, sticking to your guns, staying with the original guess? Are you better off switching to whatever curtain is left? Or does it not matter? It's just random probability, and it's not going to make a difference whether you switch or not. So that is the brain teaser. Pause the video now. I encourage you to think about it. In the next video, we will start to analyze the solution a little bit deeper, whether it makes any difference at all. So now I've assumed that you've unpaused it. You've thought deeply about it. Perhaps you have an opinion on it. Now let's work it through a little bit. And at any point, I encourage you to pause it and kind of extrapolate beyond what I've already talked about. So let's think about the game show from the show's point of view. So the show knows where there's the goat and where there isn't the goat. So let's door number one, door number two, and door number three. So let's say that our prize is right over here. So our prize is the car. Our prize is the car, and that we have a goat over here, and over here we also have-- maybe we have two goats in this situation. So what are we going to do as the game show? Remember, the contestants don't know this. We know this. So the contestant picks door number one right over here. Then we can't lift door number two because there's a car back there. We're going to lift door number three, and we're going to expose this goat. In which case, it probably would be good for the person to switch. If the person picks door number two, then we as the game show can show either door number one or door number three, and then it actually does not make sense for the person to switch. If they picked door number three, then we have to show door number one because we can't pick door number two. And in that case, it actually makes a lot of sense for the person to switch. Now, with that out of the way, let's think about the probabilities given the two strategies. So if you don't switch, or another way to think about this strategy is you always stick to your guns. You always stick to your first guess. Well, in that situation, what is your probability of winning? Well, there's three doors. The prize is equally likely to be behind any one of them. So there's three possibilities. One has the outcome that you desire. The probability of winning will be 1/3 if you don't switch. Likewise, your probability of losing, well, there's two ways that you can lose out of three possibilities. It's going to be 2/3. And these are the only possibilities, and these add up to one right over here. So don't switch, 1/3 chance of winning. Now let's think about the switching situation. So let's say always-- when you always switch. Let's think about how this might play out. What is your probability of winning? And before we even think about that, think about how you would win if you always switch. So if you pick wrong the first time, they're going to show you this. And so you should always switch. So if you pick door number one, they're going to show you door number three. You should switch. If you picked wrong door number three, they're going to show you door number one. You should switch. So if you picked wrong and switch, you will always win. Let me write this down. And this insight actually came from one of the middle school students in the summer camp that Khan Academy was running. It's actually a fabulous way to think about this. So if you pick wrong, so step one, so initial pick is wrong, so you pick one of the two wrong doors, and then step two, you always switch, you will land on the car. Because if you picked one of the wrong doors, they're going to have to show the other wrong door. And so if you switch, you're going to end up on the right answer. So what is the probability of winning if you always switch? Well, it's going to be the probability that you initially picked wrong. Well, what's the probability that you initially picked wrong? Well, there's two out of the three ways to initially pick wrong. So you actually have a 2/3 chance of winning. There's a 2/3 chance you're going to pick wrong and then switch into the right one. Likewise, what's your probability of losing, given that you're always going to switch? Well, the way that you would lose is you pick right, you picked correctly. In step two, they're going to show one of the two empty or non-prize doors. And then step three, you're going to switch into the other empty door. But either way, you're definitely going to switch. So the only way to lose, if you're always going to switch, is to pick the right the first time. Well, what's the probability of you picking right the first time? Well, that is only 1/3. So you see here, it's sometimes counter-intuitive, but hopefully this makes sense as to why it isn't. You have a 1/3 chance of winning if you stick to your guns, and a 2/3 chance of winning if you always switch. Another way to think about it is, when you first make your initial pick, there's a 1/3 chance that it's there, and there's a 2/3 chance that it's in one of the other two doors. And they're going to empty out one of them. So when you switch, you essentially are capturing that 2/3 probability. And we see that right there. So hopefully you enjoyed that.",math_statistics-probability_probability-library
" -  What we're going to do in this video is get some practice classifying whether a random variable is a binomial variable, and we're gonna do it by looking at a few exercises from Khan Academy. So this says a manager oversees 11 female employees and nine male employees. They need to pick three of these employees to go on a business trip, so the manager places all 20 names in a hat and chooses at random. Let X equal the number of female employees chosen. So they're going to do three trials. And on each of those trials, you could say success is if they pick a female employee. And then the random variable X is the number of females out of those three. Is X a binomial variable? Why or why not? So pause this video, and see if you can work through this on your own. All right, now let's go through each choice. Choice A says each trial isn't being classified as a success or failure, so X is not a binomial variable. I disagree with this. Each trial is being classified as a success or failure. It's either going to be female or not. And since we're counting the number of female employees, if in a trial, we pick a female, that would be a success, so each trial is being classified as a success or failure. So this one over here isn't true. There is no fixed number of trials, so X is not a binomial variable. There is a fixed number of trials. They're doing three trials. They're picking three names out of a hat. The trials are not independent, so X is not a binomial variable. So this is interesting. So, for example, trial one, what's the probability of success? Well, there are 20 employees, 20 names in the hat, and 11 of the outcomes would be success, so you have 11/20 probability of success. But in trial two, what's the probability of success given success, success in, I'll say trial one, T one? Well, if you succeeded in trial one, that means that there's now only 10 female names in the hat out of 19. And if you don't have success in trial one, then it'll be 11 out of 19. So your probability does change based on previous outcomes. And so the trials are not independent, and so X is not a binomial variable. So this one is true. The trials are not independent, so that violates that condition for being a binomial variable. In order to be a binomial variable, all your trials have to be independent of each other. And so we'd rule this last one out because this last one says that X has a binomial distribution or is or does meet all the conditions for being a binomial variable. Let's do another example. So here we have different scenarios, and I have the conditions for a binomial variable written right over here. And so once again, pause the video, and look at each of these scenarios for random variables. And look at these conditions, and think about whether these random variables are binomial or not. So let's look at the first one. In a game involving a standard deck of 52 playing cards, an individual randomly draws seven cards without replacement. Let Y be equal to the number of aces drawn. Well, in our introductory video to binomial variables, we talked about, if we're doing without replacement, your probability of getting an ace on a given trial, where a trial is you're taking a card out of the deck, it's going to be dependent on whether you got aces in previous trials. Because if you got an ace in a previous trial, well, that ace, then you're gonna have fewer aces in the deck. So the trials, in this case, are not independent, not independent, not independent trials. Now, on the other hand, if on every trial you looked at whatever card you got and put it back in the deck, then they would be independent trials. The probability of getting an ace on each trial would be the same, but not when you have without replacement. So this is not binomial right over here because you don't have independent trials. The second scenario, 60% of a certain species of tomato live after transplanting from pot to garden. Eli transplants 16 of these tomato plants. Assume that the plants live independently of each other. So whether one plant lives isn't dependent on whether another plant lives. Let T equal the number of tomato plants that live. All right, so let's look at the conditions. The outcome of each trial can be classified as either success or failure. So each trial over here is one of the tomato plants, and we have 16 of those trials. And success is if the tomato plant lives, and failure is if it dies. So we have either success or failure. Each trial is independent of the others. They tell us, the plants live independently of each other. So whether or not a neighboring plants lives or dies doesn't affect whether the plant next to it lives or dies. So each trial is independent of the others. There is a fixed number of trials. Yes, we have 16 right over there. The probability p of success on each trial remains constant. Well, yeah, according to at least the scenario, they're saying that we have a 60% chance for each tomato plant, which is each trial. So it meets all of the conditions right over here, so this one is binomial. Now let's look at this third scenario. In a game of luck, a turn consists of a player continuing to roll a pair of six-sided die until they roll a double, two of the same face values. Let X equal the number of rolls in one turn. So you're gonna keep rolling until they roll a double. Well, the thing that jumps out at me is that you don't have a fixed number of trials, not fixed number of trials. You could say each trial, each roll is a trial. Success is getting a double, which has a fixed probability. Whether or not you get a double on each trial is gonna be independent of the previous roll. So it meets all the other constraints, but it does not meet that there's a fixed number of trials. You're gonna keep, someone, there's some chance you might have to roll 20 times or 200 times or who knows however many times until they roll a double. And so this violates there is a fixed number of trials. So since there is not a fixed number of trials, this variable X, not binomial.",math_ap-statistics_random-variables-ap
" -  Flavia wanted to estimate the mean age of the faculty members at her large university. She took an SRS, or simple random sample, of 20 of the approximately 700 faculty members, and each faculty member in the sample provided Flavia with their age. The data were skewed to the right with a sample mean of 38.75. She's considering using her data to make a confidence interval to estimate the mean age of faculty members at her university. Which conditions for constructing a t interval have been met? So pause this video and see if you can answer this on your own. Okay, now let's try to answer this together. So there's 700 faculty members over here. She's trying to estimate the population mean, the mean age. She can't talk to all 700, so she takes a sample, a simple random sample of 20, so the n is equal to 20 here. From this 20, she calculates a sample mean of 38.75. Now ideally, she wants to construct a t interval, a confidence interval, using the t statistic and so that interval would look something like this. It would be the sample mean plus or minus the critical value times the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of n. And we use a t statistic like this and a t table and a t distribution when we are trying to create confidence intervals for means where we don't have access to the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, but we can compute the sample standard deviation. Now in order for this to hold true, there's three conditions just like what we saw when we thought about z intervals. The first is is that our sample is random. Well, they tell us that here that she took a simple random sample of 20, and so we know that we are meeting that constraint, and that's actually choice A, the data is a random sample from the population of interest, so we can circle that in. So the next condition is the normal condition. Now the normal condition when we're doing a t interval is a little bit more involved because we do need to assume that the sampling distribution of the sample means is roughly normal. Now there's a couple of ways that we can get there. Either our sample size is greater than or equal to 30. The central limit theorem tells us that then our sampling distribution, regardless of what the distribution is in the population, that the sampling distribution actually would then be approximately normal. She didn't mean that constraint right over here. Here, her sample size is only 20, so so far this isn't looking good. Now that's not the only way to meet the normal condition. Another way to meet the normal condition, if we have a smaller sample size smaller than 30 is one, if the original distribution of ages is normal, so original distribution normal, or even if it's roughly symmetric around the mean, so approximately symmetric, but if look at it, this, they tell us that it has right skew. They say the data were skewed to the right with the sample mean of 38.75. So that tells us that the data set that we're getting in our sample is not symmetric, and the original distribution is unlikely to be normal. Think about it. It's not going to be, you're likely to have people who are, you could have faculty members who are 30 years older than this, 68 and three quarters, but you're very unlikely to have faculty members who are 30 years younger than this, and that's actually what's causing that skew to the right. So this one does not meet the normal condition. We can't feel good that our sampling distribution of the sample means is going to be normal, so I'm not gonna fill that one in. Choice C: Individual observations can be considered independent. So there's two ways to meet this constraint. One is is if we sample with replacement. Every faculty member we look at after asking them their age, we say, ""Hey, go back into the pool and we might pick 'em again ""until we get our sample of 20."" It does not look like she did that. It doesn't look like she sampled with replacement, and so even if you're sampling without replacement, the 10% rule says that, ""Look, as long as this is less than ""10% or less than or equal to 10% of the population, ""then we're good,"" and the 10% of this population is 70; 70 is 10% of 700, and so this is definitely less than or equal to 10%, and so it can be considered independent, and so we can actually meet that constraint as well. So the main issue where our t interval might not be so good is that our sampling distribution, we can't feel so confidant that that is going to be normal.",math_ap-statistics_estimating-confidence-ap
" -  So here I'd like to talk about what the gradient means in the context of the graph of a function. So in the last video, I defined the gradient, but let me just take a function here. And the one that I had graphed is x-squared plus y-squared, f of x, y, equals x-squared plus y-squared. So two-dimensional input, which we think about as being kind of the xy-plane, and then a one-dimensional output that's just the height of the graph above that plane. And I defined in the last video, the gradient, to be a certain operator. An operator just means you've taken a function and you output another function, and we use this upside down triangle. So it gives you another function that's also of x and y, but this time it has a vector valued output. And the two components of its output are the partial derivatives, partial of f with respect to x, and the partial of f with respect to y. So for a function like this, we actually evaluated it. Let's take a look. The first one is taking the derivative with respect to x, so it looks at x and says, ""You look like a variable to me. ""I'm gonna take your derivative, your 2x."" 2x, but the y component just looks like a constant as far as the partial x is concerned. And the derivative of a constant is zero. But when you take the partial derivative with respect to y, things reverse. It looks at the x component and says, ""You look like a constant. ""Your derivative is zero."" But it looks at the y component and says, ""Ah, you look like a variable. ""Your derivative is 2y."" So this ultimate function we get, the gradient, which takes in a two variable input, xy, some point on this plane, but outputs a vector, can nicely be visualized with a vector field. And I have another video on vector fields if you're feeling unsure. But I want you to just take a moment, pause if you need to, and guess, or try to think about what vector field this will look like. I'm gonna show you in a moment, but what's it gonna look like, the one that takes in xy and outputs 2x, 2y? Alright, have you done it, have you thought about what it's gonna look like? Here's what we get. It's a bunch of vectors pointing away from the origin. And the basic reason for that is that if you have any given input point, and say it's got coordinates x, y, then the vector that that input point represents would, you know, if it went from the origin here, that's what that vector looks like, but the output is two times that vector. So when we attach that output to the original point, we get something that's two times that original vector but pointing in the same direction, which is away from the origin. We kind of drew it poorly here. And of course, when we draw vector fields, we don't usually draw them to scale. You scale them down just so that things don't look as cluttered. That's why everything here, they all look the same length, but color indicates length. So you should think of these red guys as being really long, the blue ones as being really short. So what does this have to do with the graph of the function? There's actually a really cool interpretation. So imagine that you are just walking along this graph, you know, you're a hiker and this is a mountain. And you picture yourself at any old point on this graph, let's say, what color should I use? Let's say you're sitting at a point like this. And you say, ""What direction should I walk ""to increase my altitude the fastest?"" You want to get uphill as quickly as possible. And from that point, you might walk what looks like straight up there. You certainly wouldn't go around, and this way you wouldn't go down. So you might go straight up there. And if you project your point down onto the input space, so this is the point above which you are, that vector, the one that's gonna get you going uphill the fastest, the direction you should walk. For this graph, it should kind of make sense, is directly away from the origin, 'cause here, I'll erase this 'cause once I start moving things, that won't stick. If you were to look at things from the very bottom, any point that you are on the mountain on the graph here and when you want to increase the fastest, you should just go directly away from the origin 'cause that's when it's the steepest. And all of these vectors are also pointing directly away from the origin. So people will say the gradient points in the direction of steepest ascent, that might even be worth writing down. Direction of steepest ascent. And let's just see what that looks like in the context of another example. So I'll pull up another graph here, pull up another graph and its vector field. So this graph, it's all negative values, it's all below the xy-plane, and it's got these two different peaks. And I've also drawn the gradient field, which is the word for the vector field representing the gradient on top. And you'll notice near the peak all of the vectors are pointing kind of in the uphill direction, sort of telling you to go towards that peak in some way. And as you get a feel around, you can see here, this very top one, like the point that it's stemming from corresponds with something just a little bit shy of the peak there. And everybody's telling you to go uphill. Each vector is telling you which way to walk to increase the altitude on the graph the fastest. It's the direction of steepest ascent. And that's what the direction means, but what does the length mean? Well, if you take a look, take a look at these red vectors here. So red means that they should be considered very, very long. And the graph itself, the point they correspond to on the graph is just way off screen for us because this graph gets really steep and really negative very fast. So the points these correspond to have really, really steep slopes whereas these blue ones over here, you know, it's kind of a relatively shallow slope. By the time you're getting to the peak, things start leveling off. So the length of the gradient vector actually tells you the steepness of that direction of steepest ascent. But one thing I want to point out here, it doesn't really make sense immediately looking at it, why just throwing the partial derivatives into a vector is gonna give you this direction of steepest ascent. Ultimately it will. We're gonna talk through that and I hope to make that connection pretty clear, but unless you're some kind of intuitive genius, I don't think that connection is at all obvious at first. But you will see it in due time. It's gonna require something called the directional derivative. See you next video.",math_multivariable-calculus_multivariable-derivatives
" -  Let's talk a little bit about the water cycle, which we're all familiar with. In fact, we're all part of the water cycle, every moment of our lives. We might not fully appreciate it. So let's just jump in the cycle. I'll start with evaporation. So we could start with the surface of the ocean here, or this river, or this lake. And at any given moment, there's going to be water evaporating off of that surface. Water molecules that were in their liquid state, liquid state, they just have enough energy to bounce away and go into the gas state. And water in a gaseous state we call vapor, water vapor. Water, water vapor. And so that water vapor, it is going to rise, likely with the air that has been heated on the surface, due to the sun, and there's other more complex dynamics at play, but as it rises, and as the overall temperature cools, that water vapor will condense into little droplets. It'll condense around little, tiny air particles, little particles of dust that you can't even see with your eye, and that's what forms clouds. So this is little droplets, so the water's actually back to the liquid form, they're not individual water molecules anymore, they're now able to interact with each other, and they're condensing around these little, microscopic dust particles to form these water droplets. And if it's cold enough, they might also form small ice crystals, and that's what clouds are. And we see here, they're talking about transportation, you can have these clouds, we obviously, if you look outside and you see clouds, those clouds are moving with the wind. And so they could be moving all of those droplets with the overall wind. And when those droplets get heavy enough, they will precipitate, they will precipitate down. Now they could precipitate back into where we started, they could go back to the ocean there. Or you could go onto a mountain here, and since if the air is cold enough, and if you have the right conditions, that precipitation might be snow, and it might stay snow right over there. Or ice, but then eventually things might warm up, or they might not warm up, but if they do warm up, well, then, they would melt, and there would be snow melt run-off. And that's what you're seeing there. If that rain is falling in this area, so let's say it's not cold enough for it to be snow, we are talking about rain. Well, most of that water is actually going to percolate down into the soil. So most of it goes down. We look around us and we see these rivers and lakes, and we say wow, there's a lot of water there. But it turns out, there's actually a lot more water inside the ground and obviously, in the ocean. And we'll talk about that in a little bit. So you have all of this water that forms in these underground aquafiers here. But some of it also ends up in these lakes and these lakes are usually in a situation where the ground is either already saturated with water, or there's the right types of rocks, so it can contain the water up here, and similarly, rivers are formed by runoff, it's snow melt run-off can famously form rivers. And in general, if you see a creek or a river near your house, especially when it rains it fills up, that's a good indication that the ground water's already saturated and so things are running off into that river. And so that in general is the water cycle. You have evaporation, it condenses into clouds, it eventually precipitates, and it keeps going, round and round and round. Now of course, there's others actors at play. You have things like plants. Plants will take up water from the upper soil, as far as the plant's roots go. And it will use that water to transport nutrients down from the soil up into the leaves. It also uses that water as part of the photosynthesis process that we've studied in many videos. And a lot of that water gets transpired out. So once again, this is transpiration, essentially, evaporation out the leaves of the water. Over here you see this word sublimation. That's going straight from the solid form of water, ice, into the gas form of water, or water vapor. And this will happen in situations where it's cold and it's very, very, very, very dry. And you have, in general, low pressure. So instead of going into the liquid state, right then the water molecules start just leaving as water vapor. And of course, I said, we're part of it. Well, how are we part of it? We will drink some of this fresh water, our bodies are actually mostly water. The cells in our bodies are 70% water. Everything we study in biology, water is a key environment for all of these things to occur. And then we use that water, and then we will get that water out of our body, and then it continues on as part of this water cycle. Now one thing that I find really interesting, as an organism that is dependent on fresh water, when people say fresh water, we're talking about water without salt, as opposed to salt water. So we really need the fresh water in this lake, or in this river, or we might dig wells, so that we can get the water out of these aquafiers. It actually turns out that very little of the overall water in the world is fresh water. And so let me show you this chart over here. I always knew that, but I didn't fully appreciate how little was fresh water. So of all the water on our planet, 97.5% is salt water, for the most part, in our oceans. Only 2-1/2% is fresh water. And even of that 2-1/2% fresh water, very little of it is what we traditionally associate fresh water, the lakes and the rivers. When I think of fresh water, I'm gonna say oh, let me go to a lake or a river, that's stuff that we could potentially drink. But most of it is actually in glaciers and permanent snow cover. So it's ice, snow, that is just not melting. And it makes you think about what would happen if this stuff were to melt. And then you also have ground water, which we could have access to. That's why people dig wells, so we're talking about, well, ground water includes soil moisture, swamp water, and permafrost. Very little of the water is actually in lakes and rivers, which I personally find fascinating. It wasn't obvious to me before I, frankly, saw this chart. Now another really interesting thing is, how long, on average, water molecules might stay in different parts of this water cycle. Going back here, you can imagine that a water molecule can stay for a very long time in the ocean, especially, you know it's going to be moving around, depending on ocean currents and temperature and all of that, but you can imagine, it could stay in that liquid form in that ocean for a very long time. And maybe it spends a shorter amount of time in a cloud. And people have actually studied this, which I find fascinating. I'd be curious to figure out how they actually got this data. But this is the average residence time for water molecules. And you can see here that water can stay in glaciers and permafrost for a very long time, we're talking it could be up to 10,000 years, and these are all rough numbers. It can stay as ground water anywhere from two weeks, to 10,000 years, I guess, depending on how isolated that ground water is. It could be in the oceans and seas as salt water for 4,000 years, and we can look at all of these, all the way, within living organisms, it'll stay about, on average, a water molecule will last about a week in the atmosphere, so that's getting water vapor, turning into a cloud, precipitating down, on average, one and a half weeks. And once again, these are averages. It doesn't mean that every water molecule will stay exactly one and half weeks in the atmosphere, but it's a pretty interesting thing to think about, and it gives you a little bit more sense of, well, one, where all the water is, and how it all works together with the water cycle.",science_biology_ecology
" -  Let's see if we can take the indefinite integral of sine of x to the fourth dx. And like always, pause the video and see if you can work through it on your own. So if we had an odd exponent up here, whether it was a sine or a cosine, then the technique I would use, so if this was sine to the third of x, I would separate one of the sine of xs out, so I would rewrite it as sine squared x times sine of x, and then I would convert this using the Pythagorean Identity, and then when I distribute the sine of x, I'd be able to use u-substitution. We've done that in previous example videos. You could have done this if it was cosine to the third of x as well, or to the fifth, or to the seventh, if you had an odd exponent. But here we have an even exponent. So what do we do? So the technique we will use, and I guess you could call it a trick, the technique or trick to use is once again you want to algebraically manipulate this so you can use integration techniques that we are familiar with. And in this case we would want to use the Double Angle Identity. The Double Angle Identity tells us that sine squared of x is equal to 1/2 times one minus cosine of two x. So how can I apply this over here? Our original integral is just the same thing as, this is going to be the same thing as the integral of sine of x squared, all of that squared, dx. Now I can make this substitution. So this is the same thing as this, which is of course the same thing as this by the Double Angle Identity. So I could rewrite it as the integral of 1/2 times one minus cosine of two x, and then all of that squared dx. And what is that going to be equal to? That's going to be equal to, let's see. 1/2 squared is 1/4, so I can take that out. So we get 1/4 times the integral of... I'm just going to square all this business. One squared, which is one, minus two cosine of two x plus cosine squared of two x dx. Fairly straightforward to take the indefinite integral, or to take the antiderivative of these two pieces. But what do I do here? Once again I've got an even exponent. Let's apply the Double Angle Identity for cosine. We know that cosine squared of two x is going to be equal to 1/2 times one plus cosine of double this angle, so cosine of four x. Once again just make the substitution. This is going to be equal to... Actually let me just write it this way. 1/4, and maybe I'll switch... I'll just keep it in this color. 1/4 times one minus two cosine two x plus 1/2, I'll just distribute the 1/2. Plus 1/2 plus 1/2 cosine of four x dx. Let's see, I could take this 1/2 and add it to this one, and that's going to get me 3/2, so add those together, I'm going to get 3/2. So let me rewrite this as, I'm in the home stretch really, this is going to be equal to 1/4 times the integral of 3/2 minus two cosine of two x. The derivative of four x is four, so it'd be great if I had a four out here. Let me rewrite 1/2 as four over eight. Really I'm just multiplying and dividing by four. That's one way to think about it. So I could say, plus 1/8 times four cosine of four x. I'm just doing this so that it's... In theory you could do u-substitution, but we've have a lot of practice with this. I have a function, I have its derivative, I could just integrate with respect to the four x right over there. I guess you could say it's the reverse chain rule, which is really what u-substitution is all about. Now I'm ready to integrate. So this is going to be equal to, I think we deserve a little bit of a drumroll, 1/4 times 3/2 x, c-derivative of two x is sitting right over here too, so this is going to be minus sine of two x. We can verify that this is a c-derivative of this. It's going to be two cosine of two x, we have it right over there, plus 1/8 times sine of four x. Derivative of sine of four x is going to be four cosine of four x, which is exactly what we have there. And then home stretch, we just write the plus C, plus sub constant. This is an indefinite integral. And we're all done. This wasn't the simplest of problems, but it also wasn't too bad. And it's strangely satisfying to get it done.",math_old-integral-calculus_integration-techniques
" -  Let's see if we can take this quadratic expression here, X squared plus 16 X plus nine and write it in this form. You might be saying, hey Sal, why do I even need to worry about this? And one, it is just good algebraic practice to be able to manipulate things, but as we'll see in the future, what we're about to do is called completing the square. It's a really valuable technique for solving quadratics and it's actually the basis for the proof of the quadratic formula which you'll learn in the future. So it's actually a pretty interesting technique. So how do we write this in this form? Well one way to think about is if we expanded this X plus A squared, we know if we square X plus A it would be X squared plus two A X plus A squared, and then you still have that plus B, right over there. So one way to think about it is, let's take this expression, this X squared plus 16 X plus nine, and I'm just gonna write it with a few spaces in it. X squared plus 16 X and then plus nine, just like that. And so, if we say alright, we have an X squared here. We have an X squared here. If we say that two A X is the same thing as that, then what's A going to be? So this is two A times X. Well, that means two A is 16 or that A is equal to 8. And so if I want to have an A squared over here, well if A is eight, I would add an eight squared which would be a 64. Well I can't just add numbers willy nilly to an expression without changing the value of an expression so if don't want to change the value of the expression, I still need to subtract 64. So notice, all that I have done now, is I just took our original expression and I added 64 and I subtracted 64, so I have not changed the value of that expression. But what was valuable about me doing that, is now this first part of the expression, this part right over here, it fits the pattern of a perfect square quadratic right over here. We have X squared plus two A X, where A is 8, plus A squared, 64. Once again, how did I get 64? I took half of the 16 and I squared it to get to the 64. And so the stuff that I just squared off, this is going to be X plus eight squared. X plus eight, squared. Once again I know that because A is eight, A is eight, so this is X plus eight squared, and then all of this business on the right hand side. What is nine minus 64? Well 64 minus nine is 55, so this is going to be negative 55. So minus 55, and we're done. We've written this expression in this form, and what's also called completing the square.",math_algebra-home_alg-quadratics
" Find the probability of rolling even numbers three times using a six-sided die numbered from 1 to 6. So let's just figure out the probability of rolling it each of the times. So the probability of rolling even numbers. So even roll on six-sided die. So let's think about that probability. Well, how many total outcomes are there? How many possible rolls could we get? Well, you get one, two, three, four, five, six. And how many of them satisfy these conditions, that it's an even number? Well, it could be a 2, it could be a 4, or it could be a 6. So the probability is the events that match what you need, your condition for right here, so three of the possible events are an even roll. And it's out of a total of six possible events. So there is a-- 3 over 6 is the same thing as 1/2 probability of rolling even on each roll. Now they're going to roll-- they want to roll even three times. And these are all going to be independent events. Every time you roll, it's not going to affect what happens in the next roll, despite what some gamblers might think. It has no impact on what happens on the next roll. So the probability of rolling even three times is equal to the probability of an even roll one time, or even roll on six-sided die-- this thing over here is equal to that thing times that thing again. All right, that's our first roll-- we copy and we paste it-- times that thing and then times that thing again. Right? That's our first roll, which is that. That's our second roll. That's our third roll. They're independent events. So this is going to be equal to 1/2-- that's the same 1/2 right there-- times 1/2 times 1/2, which is equal to 1 over 8. There's a 1 in 8 possibility that you roll even numbers on all three rolls. On this roll, this roll, and that roll.",math_precalculus_prob-comb

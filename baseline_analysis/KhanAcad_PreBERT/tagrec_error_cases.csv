" -  So, what we're gonna think about in this video is multiplying fractions. So, let's say that we wanted to take 2/3 and we want to multiply it by four, what is this going to be equal to? Pause this video and try to think about it on your own. Alright, now let's work through this together. And, to help us, I will use a number line, and let's say that each of these hash marks represent a third. So, this is zero, this is 1/3, 2/3, 3/3, 4/3, 5/3, 6/3, 7/3, 8/3, and 9/3, and so where is 2/3 times one? Well, 2/3 times one is just going to be 2/3, we just take a jump of 2/3, so that is times 1. If we multiply by, or if we take 2/3 times two, that'll be two jumps, so one 2/3, two 2/3, three 2/3, and then four 2/3. So, we just took four jumps of 2/3 each. You could view that as 2/3 plus 2/3 plus 2/3 plus 2/3, and where does that get us to? It got us to 8/3. So, notice, 2/3 times four is equal to 8/3. Now, we could go the other way, we could look at a number line and think about what are ways to represent what the number line is showing us? And, on Khan Academy, we have some example problems that do it that way, so I thought it would be good to do an example like that. And, so, let's label this number line a little bit different. Instead of each of these lines representing a third, let's say they represent a half, so zero, 1/2, 2/2, 3/2, 4/2, 5/2, why did I write 5/6, my brain is going ahead, 5/2, 6/2, 7/2, 8/2, and 9/2. And, let's say we were to see something like this. So, if you were to just see this representation, so I'm going to try to draw it like this, so if you were to just see this representation, what is that trying to represent? What type of multiplication is that trying to represent? Well, you could view that as 3/2 plus another 3/2 plus another 3/2, 'cause, notice, each of these jumps are three 1/2, or 3/2. So, you could view this as 3/2 plus 3/2 plus 3/2, or another way of thinking about it is this is three jumps of 3/2. So, you can also view this as doing the same thing as three times 3/2, and what are these equal to? Well, 3/2 plus 3/2 plus 3/2, or three times 3/2, it gets you to 9/2.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_4th-multiply-fractions
" -  Where is the point on the number line? Well, here it is, here is the point. But I'm guessing that they're asking not literally just to find it and look at it but what number is this point graphed at. Where is this on the number line? So, one thing we know pretty quickly is the number is between three and four. It's greater than three but it's not quite four. But to figure out how much greater than three we need to know what these black tick marks represent. So, between three and four there is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten equal spaces. So, each of these distances, each of these equal spaces, is one tenth or one tenth of the distance between three and four. It's one out of ten equal spaces. So, if that's one tenth and this next space is another one tenth. And then we have to travel one more tenth to get to our point. So, we went three, we know it's three. Plus, one, two, three tenths. Three and three tenths. Or, let's write this as a decimal, let's look at it as a decimal. If we wanted, we could have our ones place value and then after the ones, the decimal and the tenths. So, for the ones, there's three ones. And how many tenths did we see here? There were three tenths. So, either way we can say three and three tenths or three and three tenths. Our decimal, our point is 3.3 on the number line.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_imp-decimals
"  In this video I want to clarify a little bit about why we calculate the percent changes when we're thinking about elasticity the way that we do. So just to remind ourselves, a little focus on price elasticity of demand, although we've been exposed to other types of elasticities already. Just as a review, price elasticity of demand, so the elasticity of demand, is defined as the percent change in quantity demanded over the percent change in price. So first I'll calculate it the conventional way, the way you would do it in a traditional microeconomics class. Then I'll calculate it the way that you would just based on how you would traditionally calculate percentages and we'll see why microeconomists like to do it the way that they do. First we'll talk about the ""correct"" way. I'll put it in quotes because correct is by definition really just by convention. But when we first think about the percent change in quantity, percent change in quantity and we're going to assume, we're going to calculate the elasticity of demand between point A over here, point A and point B over here. So what is our percent change in quantity? Well, our absolute change in quantity going from A to B we have increased by 2. So we have increased by 2. I'll write it down here. This is going to be 2 over and then this is kind of the slightly strange thing that we do when we calculate our percentages. We don't say 2 over 4. We say 2 over the average of 4 and 6. It's 2 over the average of our starting point and our ending point. The average of 4 and 6 is 5. So this is going to be ... We have a 40% change based on how we calculated the percentages in our quantity demanded, and then let's do our percent change in price. So this is all going to be over our percent change in price. Our absolute change in price is negative 1 dollar. Negative 1 dollar and then instead of doing it over our starting point over 2, we do it over the average of the 2, over 150. Negative 1 over 150 is negative two-thirds, or right about negative 66.7% if we say roughly. So this right over here ... so based on how we calculated percentages, and I want to make it clear, this is kind of a strange way, when we do it over the midpoint of the starting and ending points, but we're saying that our percent change from A to B in quantity, so our percent change in quantity, this right over here we are saying it is 40%, and then we are saying that this percent change in price right over here is negative 66.7%. Now, the reason why this is valuable, and then obviously if you do the math right here, 40% over negative 66.7% percent, you're going to get some let's see you're going to get something. I think it's going to be in the 6s. Point 6 something but let's actually get a calculator out to calculate it. It would be 40 divided by 66.7 gives you, it's almost 60 so it's roughly point 60 if we were to round. This is approximately 0.60. It was 597 something. Actually I'll just leave it that way at point 60. Now, what's cool about this or what's useful about this, and this is the reason why we kind of mis-do it is, you would get the same answer whether you're going from A to B or whether you're going from B to A. This is the situation where we're going from A to B, but if we were to go from B to A, if we were to go from B to A it's the exact same thing. If we go from B to A what is our change in quantity? Our change in quantity is negative 2. It would be negative 2 over, now you wouldn't do it over your starting point. You do it over the average. This is why we will get the same value regardless of what direction we go in. We get the average of 4 and 6 is going to be 5. That's going to be over. Now going from B to A what is our change in price? Our change in price is now plus 1. It is plus 1 over the average of our starting point and our ending point, over 150. Now these are the exact same quantities. Both are going to be a negative number. Here the negative is on the bottom. Here the negative is on top. Either way and actually this was a negative point 60 because you have a positive divided by a negative. This too when you evaluate it, is going to turn out to be the exact same thing. It's going to be negative 0.60. Now if you calculated percentages in the traditional way, you would not get the same value for the price elasticity of demand, whether you go from A to B and B to A. Just to show that to you, I will put this in quotation marks. It's not the ""wrong"" way to do it in general. In fact, this is how you would calculate price changes traditionally, but it's not how you do it in kind of a microeconomic sense. If you did the wrong way ... If you said from A to B your absolute change in quantity is plus 2 and your base ... Remember this is the way that it's done outside of microeconomics. Your base is 4 and then your change in price, you went down 1 and your base, you started at A, so your base is 2. This is the way you do it outside of economics class. This would be equal to 50% plus 50% over negative 50%, over negative 50%. You essentially get negative 1. Going from A to B using a traditional way of calculating percent change. What happens if you go from B to A? What happens if you go from B to A? Now, all of the sudden, your change in quantity is negative 2. Your base is now ... the starting point is 6. Your starting point is 6. Then your change in price, once again you're increasing in price by 1 going from B to A, so this is plus 1. Your base is now 1. You will get, this is negative 33% roughly, that's negative a third, so 33.333, it keeps repeating over 100%. This will be equal to negative point 33. Notice when you calculate percentages in the traditional way, you get a different answer whether you're going from A to B or whether you're going from B to A. The whole reason why when we take the percentages, we take it over the average of our starting and our ending points, over the average of our starting and ending points. is so we get the same value for the elasticity of demand along this portion of the curve. You can really view it as the average elasticity of demand over this portion of the curve and if you calculate it this way, it doesn't matter whether you're going from A to B or B to A.",economics-finance-domain_microeconomics_elasticity-tutorial
"  Let's review the unit circle definition of trig functions a little bit. Right over here I've draw a unit circle, and when we say a unit circle we're talking about a circle with radius one. For example this point right over here is the point one comma zero. X is equal to one, Y is zero. This point is the point zero comma one. This is the point negative one comma zero and this is the point zero comma negative one. The radius over here, the distance from the center of the circle which is at the origin to any point in the circle or any point on the circle, I should say, this radius is equal to one. The unit circle definition of trig functions leverages this unit circle, that's why it's called the unit circle definition, and we saw that if we define an angle as the bottom side of the angle being along the positive x-axis and then the other side of that angle, thinking about where it intersects the unit circle. Let's say this is the angle theta. We define sine of theta and cosine of theta, or cosine theta and sine of theta as the x and y coordinates of this point at which this side of the angle, the side that is not the positive x-axis, where that intersects the unit circle. For example this point right over here. We would call this, the x coordinate of this point, so this value right over here, we would call that cosine of theta. The y coordinate of that point, which is this point right over here, we would call that sine of theta. In the previous videos on the unit circle we talked about why this is really just a natural extension of the so cah toa definition. What's useful is it starts to work for negative angles, it even works for 90 degree angles, it works for angles more than 90 degrees, it works for angles less than 90 degrees, so it's really, really, really useful. What I want to do is leverage what we already know about the unit circle definition of trig functions to help prove the Pythagorean identity. It almost falls out of the fact that this point right over here is on a circle, a circle of radius one. What is the equation of a circle with radius one centered at the origin? Well the equation of that is x squared, x squared ... We have other videos where we really prove this using the distance formula, which is really just an application of the Pythagorean theorem. The equation of a unit circle centered at the origin is x squared plus y squared is equal to one, is equal to the radius squared. This distance right over here is equal to one. We've already said that we're defining cosine of theta as the x coordinate of this point and we're defining sine of theta at the y coordinate of this point and this point is sitting on the circle. It has to satisfy this relationship right over here. That means if we're defining cosine of theta to be the x, to be this x value, sine of theta to be the y value and it has to satisfy this relationship that means that cosine of theta squared plus sine squared of theta needs to be equal to one. Or sine square theta plus cosine squared of theta needs to be equal to one. That's just from the point. This is the x, cosine theta is the x coordinate, sine theta is the y coordinate. They have to satisfy this relationship which defines a circle so cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta is one. This is called, as we've seen in other videos, this is called the Pythagorean identity. You say, ""Why is that useful?"" Well using this, if you know sine of theta you can figure out what cosine of theta is going to be, or vice versa. And if you know one of cosine of theta and then you could -- Say you know cosine theta then you use this to figure out sine of theta, then you can figure out tangent of theta because tangent of theta is just sine over cosine. If you're a little bit confused as to why this is called the Pythagorean identity, well it really just falls out of where the equation of a circle even came from. If we look at this point right over here, we look at this point right over here, which we're saying is the x coordinate is cosine theta and the y coordinate is sine of theta, what is the distance between that point and the origin? Well to think about that we can construct a right triangle. This distance right over here. So that we could deal with any quadrant I'll make it the absolute value of the cosine theta is this distance right over here. And this distance right over here is the absolute value of the sine of theta. I obviously don't have to take the absolute value for this first quadrant here but if I went into the other quadrants and I were to setup a similar right triangle then the absolute value is at play. What do we know from the Pythagorean theorem? This is a right triangle here, the hypotenuse has length one, so we know that this expression squared, the absolute value of cosine of theta squared, plus this expression squared, which is this length, plus the absolute value of the sine of theta squared needs to be equal to the length of the hypotenuse squared, which is the same thing which is going to be equal to one squared. Or we could say, this is the same thing. If you're going to square something the sign, if negative it's going to be negative times a negative so it's just going to be positive so this is going to be the same thing as saying that the cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta is equal to one. This is why it's called the Pythagorean identity. Actually that's even where the equation of a circle comes from, it comes straight out of the Pythagorean theorem where your hypotenuse has length one.",math_trigonometry_unit-circle-trig-func
" -  A food scientist wants to estimate the difference between the mean weights of eggs classified as jumbo and large. They plan on taking a sample of each type of egg to construct a two-sample t interval. Which of the following are conditions for this type of interval? So before I even look at these choices, and they say choose all answers that apply, so it might be more than one, let's just think about what the conditions for inference for this type of interval actually are. So we've done this many times in many different contexts, and so we first of all have the random condition. And that's the idea that each of our samples are random or we are conducting some type of an experiment where we randomly assign folks to one or eggs in this case to one of two groups. In this case we are taking two samples, and we would hope that they are truly random samples. The second is the normal condition, and the normal condition is a little bit different depending on whether we're talking about means or whether we're talking about proportions. The random condition is essentially the same. The normal condition when we're talking about means, remember they're looking at the difference between mean weights of eggs, is you would want your, there's actually several ways to meet the normal condition. One is is if the underlying distribution is normal. The second way is if your sample sizes for each of your samples are greater than or equal to 30. So if your first sample size is greater than or equal to 30 and your second sample size is greater than or equal to 30. Or even if the underlying data you don't know if it's normal or if it isn't normal, and even if you aren't able to meet these, as long as your sample data is roughly symmetric and not skewed heavily in one way or the other, then that also roughly meets the normal condition when we're dealing with means. And then the third condition, and we see this whether we're dealing with means or proportions or differences of means or differences of proportions, is the independence condition. And this is the idea that either your individual observations are done with replacement in both of your samples or that the sample size for both of your samples is no more than 10% of the population. Then you have met this condition. So with that little bit of a review, let's see which of these apply. They observe at least 10 heavy eggs and 10 light eggs in each sample. So this actually is the normal condition when we are dealing with proportions, not for means. So I would rule this out. It's a good distractor choice. The eggs in each sample are randomly selected from their population. Yep, that's the random condition right over there, so I would select that. They sample an equal number of each type of egg. So this is a common misconception, that whether we're dealing with means or proportions, when we're thinking about the difference between say means or the difference between proportions, that somehow your sample sizes have to be the exact same. That is not the case. Your sample sizes do not have to be the exact case. Or do not have to be the exact same. So we would rule this out as well. So right over here, they have listed the random condition. They could've also listed the normal condition and the independence condition.",math_ap-statistics_two-sample-inference
" -  We're told, the table gives the amounts of materials Aya recycled. So we have the different materials here, and then it gives the various amounts. How many kilograms of paper and aluminum did Aya recycle? So pause this video and see if you can figure this out. Okay, so we're thinking about paper and aluminum, so paper is right over here. She recycled 277 kilograms of paper. And aluminum is right over here. She recycled 134 kilograms of aluminum. And so we want the combination, or the sum, of paper and aluminum, so it's going to be 277 kilograms plus 134 kilograms. So we really need to figure out what 277 plus 134 is, and in multiple videos, we have talked about how there's many different ways of approaching this. We could say, well let's just break up the 134. We could start at, actually let me do this on a number line. That sometimes is a fun thing to do. So if we were to just say, this is our number line, and we're going to start at 277 right over there. So first, we could add 100, because we have 100 right over there, so let's do that. If we add 100, so plus 100, where does it get us? Well if we add 100 here, we get to 377. So 300, I'll just write, 77. And then we could add three 10s, or 30. So then we're going to add 30. So let's add 30, so plus 30. What does that get us? So this is interesting. If you add 30 to 370, you would get to 400, and then we have another seven there, so that gets us to 407. So then we get to 407. And once again, this is just one way to try to think about it. And then, last but not least, we could add the four. So then you say, we're there right now, and then we add plus four, and seven plus four is 11, so 407 plus four is 411. So how many kilograms of paper and aluminum did Aya recycle? Would be 411 kilograms. Kilo, kilograms, and we're done.",math_arithmetic_arith-review-add-subtract
" f is a linear function whose table of values is shown below. And they give us three different x-values and the corresponding f of x values. Which graphs show functions that are increasing faster than f? So when we're talking about increasing faster, we're really talking about a higher rate of change of y with respect to f, or a higher rate of change of the vertical axis with respect to the horizontal axis, which is another way of saying which of these have a steeper slope than the function f? So let's see what the change in our vertical axis is with respect to our change in our horizontal axis. Once again, the Greek letter-- this triangle is the Greek letter delta, which is shorthand for ""change in."" So this is the change in f over the change in x. So we see over here, when x changes by 1, the value of our function changes by positive 5. And it's linear, so that's true. Between any two points, the ratio between our change in f and our change in x is the same. If we go up 1 again, we have plus 1 in the x-direction, we are once again increasing by 5. If you start from this point and go all the way here, so if you go plus 2 along x, you're going to go plus 10 along f. So it would be 10 over 2, which is still 5. So either way, the slope, or the rate of change of the vertical axis with respect to the horizontal axis, is 5 for f. Now, let's see which of these increase faster. Well, a isn't even increasing. So A is decreasing. As x increases, y is decreasing. So that definitely can't be the case. If we look at this one right over here, it looks like-- let's see, if we start over here, if we increase 1 along the x-direction, if our change in x is 1, it looks like our change in y is exactly 5-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So it looks like for choice B, our slope is exactly 5, or our change in y over change in x is exactly 5. So it's not increasing faster than f. It's increasing the same as f. Now let's look at C. So I'm going to try to find a point where it looks like I have an integer point right over here. So that's the point, negative 3, negative 3. And if I move 1 in the x-direction, it looks like I'm increasing by more than 5. I'm increasing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, it looks like. So this one looks like it has a slope of 8. So this one is increasing faster than f, so we'll circle that right over there. And now let's look at this choice. So if we start right over here-- and I just picked this point because that's at a nice integer coordinate. It's at the point 2, negative 4. If we increase x by 1, then we increase y by 1, 2, 3-- looks like about 3 and 1/2, definitely not 5. In order for it to increase as fast as f, it would have to increase by 5, so it would have to be up here. So it would have to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. It would have had to have been up here. The line would've looked something more like that just to match f, much less grow faster than f. So D does not meet the criteria. It is only C.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-linear-equations-functions
" In this video and the next few videos, we're just really going to be doing a bunch of calculations about this data set right over here. And hopefully, just going through those calculations will give you an intuitive sense of what the analysis of variance is all about. Now, the first thing I want to do in this video is calculate the total sum of squares. So I'll call that SST. SS-- sum of squares total. And you could view it as really the numerator when you calculate variance. So you're just going to take the distance between each of these data points and the mean of all of these data points, square them, and just take that sum. We're not going to divide by the degree of freedom, which you would normally do if you were calculating sample variance. Now, what is this going to be? Well, the first thing we need to do, we have to figure out the mean of all of this stuff over here. And I'm actually going to call that the grand mean. And I'm going to show you in a second that it's the same thing as the mean of the means of each of these data sets. So let's calculate the grand mean. So it's going to be 3 plus 2 plus 1 plus 5 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7. And then we have nine data points here so we'll divide by 9. And what is this going to be equal to? 3 plus 2 plus 1 is 6. 6 plus-- let me just add. So these are 6. 5 plus 3 plus 4 is 12. And then 5 plus 6 plus 7 is 18. And then 6 plus 12 is 18 plus another 18 is 36, divided by 9 is equal to 4. And let me show you that that's the exact same thing as the mean of the means. So the mean of this group 1 over here-- let me do it in that same green-- the mean of group 1 over here is 3 plus 2 plus 1. That's that 6 right over here, divided by 3 data points so that will be equal to 2. The mean of group 2, the sum here is 12. We saw that right over here. 5 plus 3 plus 4 is 12, divided by 3 is 4 because we have three data points. And then the mean of group 3, 5 plus 6 plus 7 is 18 divided by 3 is 6. So if you were to take the mean of the means, which is another way of viewing this grand mean, you have 2 plus 4 plus 6, which is 12, divided by 3 means here. And once again, you would get 4. So you could view this as the mean of all of the data in all of the groups or the mean of the means of each of these groups. But either way, now that we've calculated it, we can actually figure out the total sum of squares. So let's do that. So it's going to be equal to 3 minus 4-- the 4 is this 4 right over here-- squared plus 2 minus 4 squared plus 1 minus 4 squared. Now, I'll do these guys over here in purple. Plus 5 minus 4 squared plus 3 minus 4 squared plus 4 minus 4 squared. Let me scroll over a little bit. Now, we only have three left, plus 5 minus 4 squared plus 6 minus 4 squared plus 7 minus 4 squared. And what does this give us? So up here, this is going to be equal to 3 minus 4. Difference is 1. You square it. It's actually negative 1, but you square it, you get 1, plus you get negative 2 squared is 4, plus negative 3 squared. Negative 3 squared is 9. And then we have here in the magenta 5 minus 4 is 1 squared is still 1. 3 minus 4 squared is 1. You square it again, you still get 1. And then 4 minus 4 is just 0. So we could-- well, I'll just write the 0 there just to show you that we actually calculated that. And then we have these last three data points. 5 minus 4 squared. That's 1. 6 minus 4 squared. That is 4, right? That's 2 squared. And then plus 7 minus 4 is 3 squared is 9. So what's this going to be equal to? So I have 1 plus 4 plus 9 right over here. That's 5 plus 9. This right over here is 14, right? 5 plus-- yup, 14. And then we also have another 14 right over here because we have a 1 plus 4 plus 9. So that right over there is also 14. And then we have 2 over here. So it's going to be 28-- 14 times 2, 14 plus 14 is 28-- plus 2 is 30. Is equal to 30. So our total sum of squares-- and actually, if we wanted the variance here, we would divide this by the degrees of freedom. And we've learned multiple times the degrees of freedom here so let's say that we have-- so we know that we have m groups over here. So let me just write it as m and I'm not going to prove things rigorously here, but I want to show you where some of these strange formulas that show up in statistics books actually come from without proving it rigorously. More to give you the intuition. So we have m groups here. And each group here has n members. So how many total members do we have here? Well, we had m times n or 9, right? 3 times 3 total members. So our degrees of freedom-- and remember, you have however many data points you had minus 1 degrees of freedom because if you know the mean of means, if you assume you knew that, then only 9 minus 1, only eight of these are going to give you new information because if you know that, you could calculate the last one. Or it really doesn't have to be the last one. If you have the other eight, you could calculate this one. If you have eight of them, you could always calculate the ninth one using the mean of means. So one way to think about it is that there's only eight independent measurements here. Or if we want to talk generally, there are m times n-- so that tells us the total number of samples-- minus 1 degrees of freedom. And if we were actually calculating the variance here, we would just divide 30 by m times n minus 1 or this is another way of saying eight degrees of freedom for this exact example. We would take 30 divided by 8 and we would actually have the variance for this entire group, for the group of nine when you combine them. I'll leave you here in this video. In the next video, we're going to try to figure out how much of this total variance, how much of this total squared sum, total variation comes from the variation within each of these groups versus the variation between the groups. And I think you get a sense of where this whole analysis of variance is coming from. It's the sense that, look, there's a variance of this entire sample of nine, but some of that variance-- if these groups are different in some way-- might come from the variation from being in different groups versus the variation from being within a group. And we're going to calculate those two things and we're going to see that they're going to add up to the total squared sum variation.",math_statistics-probability_analysis-of-variance-anova-library
" -  You are already likely familiar with the notion that a dollar in the U.S., a U.S. dollar is not necessarily equivalent to one currency unit in another country, say one Euro. And so if you were traveling to that country, and you are holding dollars, and you needed to exchange those dollars into Euros, you'd say, well how many Euros am I going to get for my dollars? Or if you were European, and you had a certain number of Euro, and you said how many dollars am I going to get for my Euros, you would be thinking about the exchange rate. And it's not just about if you're a tourist or you're traveling, it's also very important if you're an importer and exporter. If you make, say cars, in the United States, where all of your costs are in dollars, but you're selling them in Europe where you're getting your money in terms of Euros, and then you have to convert them back to dollars to pay your costs, well the idea of an exchange rate matters a lot. And so, first let's make tangible what an exchange rate even looks like. And there's many different ways of representing it. The first thing to appreciate, if someone says what's the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar, your next reaction should be, with regards to what other currency? So if I said, what's the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar with respect to the Euro, you could express that as one U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar, is equal to how many Euros? And at the time of this video, it's actually 0.87 Euros. Now another way to express this is one Euro, one Euro is equal to how many U.S. dollars? And if you know this first equation, you can figure out the second one. You would essentially just divide both sides by 0.87. If you divide this by 0.87 you get one. If you divide one by 0.87, you are going to get approximately 1.15. And so at the time of this video, 1.15 U.S. dollars is equal to one Euro. Or another way to think about it is, if you took a dollar and 15 cents in the U.S. and convert it to Euros, you would get one Euro. And there's other ways of expressing it. You could say what is the price of a U.S. dollar, so price of the U.S. dollar in terms of Euro, in terms of Euro. So this is, how much would it cost to buy one U.S. dollar in terms of Euros? Well you could just look at this over here, and you could say, well, one U.S. dollar is going to cost 0.87 Euros. Or you could say 0.87 Euros, Euros per U.S., per U.S. dollar. And if you were to go the other way around, if you wanted the price of the Euro, price of the Euro in terms, terms of the U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar, well that would be the other right way around. One Euro would cost $1.15. So this would be 1.15 U.S. dollars, dollars per Euro. Now with all of this out of the way, let's actually do some calculations. Let's imagine that in the United States a yellow box goes for $20. These yellow boxes are in high demand. Someone from Europe wants to buy one of these yellow boxes, and they need to buy it for 20 U.S. dollars, but they only have Euro. How many Euro would they need in order to buy that box for 20 U.S. dollars. Well if one U.S. dollar is equal 0.87 Euros, then 20 U.S. dollars is going to be 20 times as many Euros. So we could say $20 times 0.87 Euro per dollar. This symbol right over here is shorthand for Euro. And so you are going to get, let's see, that would be 17, approximately, approximately 17.40 Euro. And if it went the other way around. Let's say that red boxes are available for purchase only in Europe for 20 Euro. An American tourist goes there, and wants to figure out how many U.S. dollars would they have to convert in order to be able to pay for one of these red boxes that are 20 Euro? Well here we see one Euro is equal to 1.15 U.S. dollars. So here you would say 20 Euro times 1.15 U.S. dollars, dollar per Euro, and so what is this going to be? This is going to be 20 times 1.15, which is going to be 23 U.S. dollars. 23 U.S. dollars. Now another idea, a related idea to this, is this notion that currencies can appreciate and depreciate. So let's say that the Euro appreciates, appreciates, and it always matters relative to something. So you say relative to the dollar. So the Euro appreciates relative to the dollar. Come up with an exchange rate that would show the Euro appreciating relative to the dollar with this as a starting point. So one scenario where this is happening is if this was where you are starting, one Euro would now be more U.S. dollars, more than 1.15 U.S. dollars. So you have one Euro, would now be equal to, maybe it's equal to $1.20 now. So it's now equal to $1.20. Now if someone said the dollar appreciates relative to the Euro, then it would go the other way around. That might be one U.S. dollars is now equivalent to .9 Euros, or maybe one Euro, or 1.05 Euros. And similarly, if someone says that the Euro depreciates, depreciates relative, relative to the dollar. That's another way of saying that the dollar has appreciated relative to the Euro. So this could be a situation where if the Euro's depreciating relative to the dollar from this place right over here, one Euro, one Euro is now equal to fewer dollars. And maybe it's now equal to $1.05. And with this as a starting point, this would also be a situation where the dollar has appreciated relative to the Euro. So I'll leave you there. This is a primer on exchange rates. It can get a little bit confusing because you're talking for the price of a currency in terms of another currency. But I encourage you to keep thinking about things. Keep doing these little thought experiments in your head, and thinking about, okay, if a Euro is equal to more than a dollar, if something's worth a certain number of Euros, it should be a larger number in terms of dollars. Similarly, if a dollar is less than one Euro, if something costs a certain number of dollars, it should be a smaller number in terms of Euros.",economics-finance-domain_ap-macroeconomics_ap-open-economy-international-trade-and-finance
" -  So, let's talk about viral replication. Since we know that viruses are made of only proteins and one type of nucleic acid, which means they have no organelles to make copies of themselves with, they have to get inside other cells in order to use their ATP and their organelles to make copies of themselves. So first step, get inside that cell. And I'm just going to mention a few things for review. So remember, there are three ways of getting into a cell. One of the ways of getting in is that bacterial phages, they literally just inject their genetic material inside of the cell. Whereas every other type of virus uses one of two ways. If they're non-enveloped they trick the cell's receptors into letting them in. Or if they're enveloped they can either use that receptor trick, or they directly fuse with the membrane. And once that genetic material is inside of the cell, the virus has hacked in, and it's ready to do a takeover. But here's where it makes a choice. It's kind of either impatient and ready to get going to copy itself, or it sits back and says, ""You know what? ""I'd rather sit and wait until I'm ready ""to take over."" So let's just draw these two possibilities out to see what happens. And with the first choice, the impatient virus goes ahead and takes over the cell's machinery. Their ATP, ribosomes, nucleic acids, amino acids, to start making copies of the virus's genetic material, which again, can be RNA or DNA. And also, the virus's proteins to make their protein coat. And these will self-assemble. That means they just come together on their own to form fully functional viruses. And because it keeps making more and more and more of these, it will eventually force the cell to lyse, or break open, and once it breaks open, all of these viruses are released into the environment. And if there are other cells nearby, then this army can start marching out to infect, to hack into those nearby cells, and create more armies. So this makes a lot of sense if you have a lot of hosts around, and your goal is to just create the biggest army in the fastest way possible. And so that's the impatient virus. So what about the other option? The other option is where the virus decides it's just going to sneak in and hitch a ride. It thinks that the bacteria seems to be doing fine on its own, maybe there aren't other hosts nearby, so there's no reason to kill off the host, because lysing it would kill the host, so we don't want that. We're just gonna keep the host alive. And in order to sneak in and let the bacteria do its thing while it's waiting, it's going to combine with the host's genetic information, so that the host really can't tell that it's there. It's basically quietly sitting there because it's repressed. There are repressor genes on this virus. So it's not expressed, it's not transcribed. So it's not doing anything. And this is called a provirus, or you might also hear the word prophage. And again, because it's not doing anything, this is called a dormant or latent phase. So the bacteria just does its own thing, it continues replicating, and of course the virus is already there. So it will continue to replicate. So it will replicate when the bacteria does, because it's part of its genome. But about one in 10,000 times that this happens, or if something happens like the bacteria is exposed to UV light or something. Well, in any case, there's something that weakens that repressor gene that we talked about on that virus. So it's no longer quiet. And the host's genome, like most other genomes, will start wanting to repair itself. That means it will cut out to try to repair its genome, it will excise out part of its DNA that just happens to be the virus. And now, the virus is active. It's ready to make copies of itself, lyse the cell, and get its army out into infecting other cells. So the official terms for the impatient method is the lytic cycle. And the hitch a ride method is called the lysogenic cycle. So now, you should have a good idea of what the lytic and lysogenic cycles are in viral replication.",science_high-school-biology_hs-human-body-systems
" In this video, we'll just talk a little bit about what the chi-square distribution is, sometimes called the chi-squared distribution. And then in the next few videos, we'll actually use it to really test how well theoretical distributions explain observed ones, or how good a fit observed results are for theoretical distributions. So let's just think about it a little bit. So let's say I have some random variables. And each of them are independent, standard, normal, normally distributed random variables. So let me just remind you what that means. So let's say I have the random variable X. If X is normally distributed, we could write that X is a normal random variable with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1. Or you could say that the expected value of X, is equal to 0, or in that the variance of our random variable X is equal to 1. Or just to visualize it is that, when we take an instantiation of this very variable, we're sampling from a normal distribution, a standardized normal distribution that looks like this. Mean of 0 and then a variance of 1, which would also mean, of course, a standard deviation of 1. So that could be the standard deviation, or the variance, or the standard deviation, that would be equal to 1. So a chi-square distribution, if you just take one of these random variables-- and let me define it this way. Let me define a new random variable. Let me define a new random variable Q that is equal to-- you're essentially sampling from this the standard normal distribution and then squaring whatever number you got. So it is equal to this random variable X squared. The distribution for this random variable right here is going to be an example of the chi-square distribution. Actually what we're going to see in this video is that the chi-square, or the chi-squared distribution is actually a set of distributions depending on how many sums you have. Right now, we only have one random variable that we're squaring. So this is just one of the examples. And we'll talk more about them in a second. So this right here, this we could write that Q is a chi-squared distributed random variable. Or that we could use this notation right here. Q is-- we could write it like this. So this isn't an X anymore. This is the Greek letter chi, although it looks a lot like a curvy X. So it's a member of chi-squared. And since we're only taking one sum over here-- we're only taking the sum of one independent, normally distributed, standard or normally distributed variable, we say that this only has 1 degree of freedom. And we write that over here. So this right here is our degree of freedom. We have 1 degree of freedom right over there. So let's call this Q1. Let's say I have another random variable. Let's call this Q-- let me do it in a different color. Let me do Q2 in blue. Let's say I have another random variable, Q2, that is defined as-- let's say I have one independent, standard, normally distributed variable. I'll call that X1. And I square it. And then I have another independent, standard, normally distributed variable, X2. And I square it. So you could imagine both of these guys have distributions like this. And they're independent. So get to sample Q2, you essentially sample X1 from this distribution, square that value, sample X2 from the same distribution, essentially, square that value, and then add the two. And you're going to get Q2. This over here-- here we would write-- so this is Q1. Q2 here, Q2 we would write is a chi-squared, distributed random variable with 2 degrees of freedom. Right here. 2 degrees of freedom. And just to visualize kind of the set of chi-squared distributions, let's look at this over here. So this, I got this off of Wikipedia. This shows us some of the probability density functions for some of the chi-square distributions. This first one over here, for k of equal to 1, that's the degrees of freedom. So this is essentially our Q1. This is our probability density function for Q1. And notice it really spikes close to 0. And that makes sense. Because if you are sampling just once from this standard normal distribution, there's a very high likelihood that you're going to get something pretty close to 0. And then if you square something close to 0-- remember, these are decimals, they're going to be less than 1, pretty close to 0-- it's going to become even smaller. So you have a high probability of getting a very small value. You have high probabilities of getting values less than some threshold, this right here, less than, I guess, this is 1 right here. So the less than 1/2. And you have a very low probability of getting a large number. I mean, to get a 4, you would have to sample a 2 from this distribution. And we know that 2 is-- actually it's 2 variances or 2 standard deviations from the mean. So it's less likely. And actually that's to get a 4. So to get even larger numbers are going to be even less likely. So that's why you see this shape over here. Now when you have 2 degrees of freedom, it moderates a little bit. This is the shape, this blue line right here is the shape of Q2. And notice you're a little bit less likely to get values close to 0 and a little bit more likely to get numbers further out. But it still is kind of shifted or heavily weighted towards small numbers. And then if we had another random variable, another chi-squared distributed random variable-- so then we have, let's say, Q3. And let's define it as the sum of 3 of these independent variables, each of them that have a standard normal distribution. So X1, X2 squared plus X3 squared. Then all of a sudden, our Q3-- this is Q2 right here-- has a chi-squared distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. And so this guy right over here-- that will be this green line. Maybe I should have done this in green. This will be this green line over here. And then notice, now it's starting to become a little bit more likely that you'd get values in this range over here because you're taking the sum. Each of these are going to be pretty small values, but you're taking the sum. So it starts to shift it a little over to the right. And so the more degrees of freedom you have, the further this lump starts to move to the right and, to some degree, the more symmetric it gets. And what's interesting about this, I guess it's different than almost every other distribution we've looked at, although we've looked at others that have this property as well, is that you can't have a value below 0 because we're always just squaring these values. Each of these guys can have values below 0. They're normally distributed. They could have negative values. But since we're squaring and taking the sum of squares, this is always going to be positive. And the place that this is going to be useful-- and we're going to see in the next few videos-- is in measuring essentially error from an expected value. And if you took take this total error, you can figure out the probability of getting that total error if you assume some parameters. And we'll talk more about it in the next video. Now with that said, I just want to show you how to read a chi-squared distribution table. So if I were to ask you, if this is our distribution-- let me pick this blue one right here. So over here, we have 2 degrees of freedom because we're adding 2 of these guys right here. If I were to ask you, what is the probability of Q2 being greater than-- or, let me put it this way. What is the probability of Q2 being greater than 2.41? And I'm picking that value for a reason. So I want the probability of Q2 being greater than 2.41. What I want to do is I'll look at a chi-square table like this. Q2 is a version of chi-squared with 2 degrees of freedom. So I look at this row right here under 2 degrees of freedom. And I want the probability of getting a value above 2.41. And I picked 2.41 because it's actually at this table. And so most of these chi-squared-- the reason why we have these weird numbers like this instead of whole numbers or easy-to-read fractions is it is actually driven by the p value. It's driven by the probability of getting something larger than that value. So normally you would look at the other way. You'd say, OK, if I want to say, what chi-squared value for 2 degrees of freedom, there's a 30% chance of getting something larger than that? Then I would look up 2.41. But I'm doing it the other way just for the sake of this video. So if I want the probability of this random variable right here being greater than 2.41, or its p value, we read it right here. It is 30%. And just to visualize it on this chart, this chi-square distribution-- this was Q2, the blue one, over here-- 2.41 is going to sit-- let's see. This is 3. This is 2.5. So 2.41 is going to be someplace right around here. So essentially, what that table is telling us is, this entire area under this blue line right here, what is that? And that right there is going to be 30% of-- well, 1it's going to be 0.3. 1Or you could view it as 30% of the entire area 1under this curve, because obviously all the probabilities 1have to add up to 1. 1So that's our intro to the chi-square distribution. 1In the next video, we're actually 1going to use it to make some, or to test some, inferences.",math_statistics-probability_inference-categorical-data-chi-square-tests
" As we begin our journey into the world of economics, I thought I would begin with a quote from one of the most famous economists of all time, the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith. And he really is kind of the first real economist in the way that we view it now. And this is from his The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, coincidentally, the same year as the American Declaration of Independence, and it's one of his most-famous excerpts. He generally indeed, he being an economic actor, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By directing that industry, so that the industry in control of that individual actor in such a manner, as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain. 'He intends only his own gain'. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. And this term ""the invisible hand"" is famous. Led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. He is saying, look, when individual actors just act in their own self-interest, that often in aggregate leads to things that each of those individual actors did not intend. Then he says: nor is it always the worst for society that it was no part of it. So, it was not necessarily a bad thing. By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. So, this is really a pretty strong statement. It's really at the core of capitalism. And that's why I point out that it was published in the same year as the American Declaration of Independence, because obviously America, the Founding Fathers, they wrote the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, that really talks about what it means to be a democratic country, what are the rights of its citizens. But the United States, with its overall experience of an American, is at least as influenced by the work of Adam Smith, by this kind of foundational ideas of capitalism. And they just both happened to happen around the same time. But this idea is not always that intuitive. Individual actors, by essentially pursuing their own self-interested ends might be doing more for society than than if any of them actually tried to promote the overall well-being of society. And I don't think that Adam Smith would say that it's always good for someone to act self-interested, or that it's never good for people to actually think about the implications of what they are doing in an aggregate sense, but he is saying that frequently .. frequently, this self-interested action *could* lead to the greater good. Could lead to more innovation. Could lead to better investment. Could lead to more productivity. Could lead to more wealth, more, a larger pie for everyone. And now Economics is frequently .. and when he makes a statement, he is actually making a mix of micro-economic and macro-economic statements. Micro is that people, individual actors are acting out of their own self-interest. And the macro is that it might be good for the economy, or the nation as a whole. And so, now, modern economists tend to divide themselves into these two schools, or into these two subjects: microeconomics, which is the study of individual actors. Microeconomics .. and those actors could be firms, could be people, it could be households. And you have macro-economics, which is the study of the economy in aggregate. Macro-economics. And you get it from the words. Micro -- the prefix refers to very small things. Macro refers to the larger, to the bigger picture. And so, micro-economics is essentially how actors .. actors make decisions or, you could actually say 'allocations', allocations .. decisions or allocations. Allocation .. of scarce resources. And you hear the words scarce resources a lot when people talk about economics. And a scarce resource is one you don't have an infinite amount of. For example, love might not be a scarce resource. You might have an infinite amount of love. But a resource that would be scarce is something like food, or water, or money, or time, or labor. These are all scarce resources. And so microeconomics is how do people decide where to put those scarce resource, how do they decide where to deploy them. And how does that .. does that affect prices and markets, and whatever else. Macro-economics is the study of what happens at the aggregate to an economy. So, 'aggregate', what happens in aggregate to an economy, from the millions of individual actors. Aggregate economy. We now have millions of actors. And often focuses on policy-related questions. SO, do you raise or lower taxes. Or, what's going to happen when you raise or lower taxes. Do you regulate or de-regulate? How does that affect the overall productivity when you do this. So, it's policy, top-down .. 'top-down' questions. And in both macro- and micro-economics, there is especially in the modern sense of it, there is an attempt to make them rigorous, to make them mathematical. So, in either case you could start with some of the ideas, some of the philosophical ideas, so of the logical ideas, to say someone like Adam Smith might have. So, you have these basic ideas about how people think, how people make decisions. So, philosophy, 'philosophy' of people, of decision-making, in the case of micro-economics -- 'decision-making' And then you make some assumptions about it. Or you simplify it .. let me write this .. you simplify it. And you really are simplifying. You say ""oh, all people are rational"", ""all people are gonna act in their own self-interest, or all people are going to maximize their gain"", which isn't true -- human beings are motivated by a whole bunch of things. We simplify things, so we can start to deal with it kind of a mathematical way. SO you simplify it, so you can start dealing with it in a mathematical sense. So, this is valuable to clarify your thinking. It can allow you to prove things based on your assumptions. And so, you can start to visualize things mathematically, with charts and graphs and think about what would actually happen with markets. So it's very valuable to have this mathematical, rigorous, thinking. But at the same time, it could be a little bit dangerous, because you are making these huge simplifications, and sometimes the math might lead you to some very strong conclusions. Conclusions, which you might feel very strongly about, because it looks like you've proven them in the same way that you might prove relativity, but they were based on some assumptions that either might be wrong, or might be over-simplifications, or might not be relevant to the context that you're trying to make conclusions about. So it's very very very important to take it all with a grain of salt, to remember that it's all based on some simplifying assumption. And macro-economics is probably more guilty of it. In micro-economics you are taking these deeply complicated things that are the human brain, how people act and respond to each other, and then you are aggregating it over millions of people, so it's ultra-complicated. You've millions of these infinitely complicated people, all interacting with each other. SO, it's very complicated. Many millions of interactions, and fundamentally unpredictable interactions, and then trying to make assumptions on those, trying to make assumptions and then doing math with that -- that could lead you to some conclusions or might be leading you to some predictions. And, once again, this is very important. This is valuable, it is valuable to make these mathematical models, with these mathematical assumptions for these mathematical conclusions, but it always need to be taken with a grain of salt. So, then you have a proper grain of salt, so that you are always focused on the true intuition. And that's really the most important thing to get from a course on economics. So you can truly reason through what's likely to happen, maybe even without the mathematics. I'll leave you with two quotes. And thse quotes are a little bit .. a little bit funny, but they're really I think helpful things to keep in mind, especially when you go deep into the mathematical side of economics. So, this right over here is a quote by Aflred Knopf, who was publisher in the 1900s. ""An economist is a man who states the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible."" And I'm assuming what he is talking about as the incomprehensible, he is referring to some of the 'mathy' stuff that you see in economics, and hopefully we're going to make this as comprehensible as possible. You'll see there is value in this. But it's a very important statement he is making. Oftentimes, it's taking a common-sense thing. It's taking something that's obvious .. that's obvious. And it's very important to always keep that in mind, to always make sure that you have the intuition for what's happening in the math, or to know when the math is going into a direction that might be strange based on over-simplifications or wrong assumptions. And then you have this quote here by Lawrence J. Peter, most famous for Peter's Principals, a professor at USC. ""An economist is an expert know will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today."" And once again -- important to keep in the back of one's mind, because especially relevant to macro-economics, because in macro-economics there is always all sorts of prediction about the state of the economy: about what need to be done, about how long the recession will last, what will be the economic growth next year, what will inflation do ... and they often prove to be wrong. In fact, few economists even tend to agree on many of these things. And it's very important to realize that, because oftentimes when you are deep in the mathematics, economics might *seem* to be a science, like physics, but it's not a science like physics. It is open .. it is open to subjectivity, and a lot of that subjectivity is all around the assumptions that you choose to make.",economics-finance-domain_macroeconomics_macro-basic-economics-concepts
" So we have two different molecules here. This is hydrogen peroxide. We call it peroxide, because it has this oxygen-oxygen bond. And here we have oxygen difluoride, where oxygen is bonded to two different fluorines. And what I want you to do is pause this video, use this periodic table of elements I have here, and this is more than just a typical information of periodic table of elements. It also gives you the electronegativities of these different elements. And these electronegativities are based on the Pauling scale named after famous biologist and chemist Linus Pauling. And so using the information here and what you know already about oxidation states, think about the oxidation states or the oxidation numbers for each of the constituent elements in these molecules. So pause the video now. So I'm assuming you have given a shot at it. And you might have immediately realized that something very interesting is going on. We've said in the past that because it's two valence electrons away from a full valence shell, because it is so electronegative, oxygen typically takes electrons from other things, typically two electrons, which typically gives it an oxidation state of negative-- an oxidation number or oxidation state of negative 2. This is so electronegative, and it so typically oxidizes other things that we've called the whole phenomenon ""oxidation."" But what's interesting here is that oxygen isn't purely bonded to things less electronegative than itself. And the hydrogen peroxide, yes, it is bonded to the hydrogen. But it's also bonded to another oxygen. And obviously, these two are going to be equally electronegative. So what would be the oxidation states or the oxidation numbers here? Well, hydrogen, once again, we portend-- hydrogen, because it's less electronegative, it would have a partially positive charge, because the electrons would spend more time around this oxygen. But when we're talking about oxidation states, we don't like this partial charge business. We want to pretend like these covalent bonds are ionic bonds, hypothetical ionic bonds. And if they were hypothetically ionic bonds, what would happen? Well, if you had to give these electrons to somebody, you would give them to the oxygen, the electrons in this period, give them to the oxygen, giving it an oxidation state of negative 1. With the hydrogen having these electrons taken away, it's going to have an oxidation state of positive 1. And the same thing's going to be true for that oxygen and that hydrogen right over there. So this is fascinating, because this is an example where oxygen has an oxidation state not of negative 2, but an oxidation state of negative 1. So this is already kind of interesting. Now it gets even more interesting when we go to oxygen difluoride. Why is this more interesting? Because fluorine is the one thing on this entire table that is more electronegative than oxygen. This is a covalent bond, but in our hypothetical ionic bond, if we had to give these electrons to one of these atoms, you would give it to the fluorine. So the fluorine, each of them would have an oxidation state of negative 1. And the oxygen here-- now, you could imagine, this is nuts for oxygen. The oxidation state for oxygen, it's giving up these electrons. It would be a positive 2. And we talk about oxidation states when we write this little superscript here. We write the sign after the number. And that's just the convention. But it has an oxidation state of positive 2. Oxygen, the thing that likes to oxidize other things, it itself has been oxidized by fluorine. So this is a pretty dramatic example of how something might stray from what's typical oxidation state or it's typical oxidation number. And in general, oxygen will have an oxidation state or oxidation number in most molecules of negative 2. But unless it's bonded with another oxygen or it's bonded to fluorine, which is a much more electronegative-- or actually, not much more, but it's the only atom that is more electronegative than-- or the only element is more electronegative than oxygen.",science_ap-chemistry_redox-reactions-and-electrochemistry-ap
" -  We've already learned that when we multiply by 10, let's say we took the number 53 and we were to multiply it by 10, it has the effect of shifting all the digits once place to the left. So, this should be a review for you. But this was going to be 530. And we could see that what used to be in the tens place has been shifted to the left, to the hundreds place. And what used to be in the ones place has been shifted to the left to the tens place now. And we saw, if you divide by 10, you have the opposite effect. And so, let's say if I had 120, I could say, let's divide by 10, I could also say this is the same thing as 120 times 1/10. What is going to happen there? Well, in this situation, all the digits are going to shift one place to the right. So, what used to be in the tens place will now be in the ones place; what used to be in the hundreds place will now be in the tens place. So, this is just going to be equal to 12. So, that was all review. But now were going to extend this a little bit by thinking about things that have place values representing less than a one, I guess you could say, or we're gonna deal with decimals. So, just to get ourselves warmed up, let's see if we could figure out what 3.015 times 10 is. Pause this video, and see if you can figure that out. Well, the exact same thing is going to happen. All of our digits are going to shift one place to the left. So, right now, we have a three in the ones place, we have a zero in the tenths place, we have a one in the hundredths place, and we have a five in the thousandths, thousandths place. But now, they're all going to shift one place to the left. So, the three is now going to into the tens place, it's going to shift one place to the left. So, we're going to have, in the tens place, we are now going to have our three. And now, this zero, which was in the tenths place, is now going to shift into the ones place. So, the zero is going to go right over, the zero's going to go right over there. That is now in the ones place. And them we'll put our decimal. And now, what's going to go into the tenths place and the hundredths place? And actually, I'll rewrite the thousandths place as well. This one is going to shift one place to the left, into the tenths place, so into the tenths place. And then the five that was in the thousandths place is now going to shift one place to the left, into the hundredths place, so into the hundredths place, just like that. Now, we could put a trailing zero over here, but that's not going to change the value of this number, so I'll just leave it like that. And so, there you have it. We see that every digit has shifted one place to the left. So, this is equal to 30.15. I'll just put that zero there for kicks. And so, we could think about the other way around. What if I were to take 67.5, and if I were to divide it by 10, or another way of thinking about it is if I were to multiply this by 1/10. Pause the video, and see if you can figure out what that's going to be. Well, now, every digit is going to shift one place to the right. So, the six is going to be in the ones place, the seven is going to go into the tenths place, and then the five is going to go into the hundredths place. So, let's write that out. So, I have six is going to go into the ones place, and then we're gonna have our decimal point, our seven is going to go into the tenths place, and then our five is going to go into the hundredths place. So, there you have it, we get 6.75.",math_cc-fifth-grade-math_powers-of-ten
" -  There are 170 deer on a reservation. The deer population is increasing at a rate of 30% per year. Write a function that gives the deer population P of t on the reservation t years from now. All right, let's think about this. And like always, pause this video, and see if you can work it out on your own. Well, let's think about what P of zero is. P of zero, this is going to be the initial population of deer, the population at time zero. Well, we know that, that's going to be the 170 deer that we start on the reservation. Now, let's think about what P of one is. What's going to be the population after one year? Well, it's going to be our original population, 170, but then it increases at a rate of 30% per year. So it's going to be 170 plus another 30% of 170. So I could write that as 30% times 170. Or I could write this as 170 plus 0.3 times 170. 30% as a decimal is the same thing as 30/100 or 3/10. Or I could write this as, if I factor out 170, I would get 170 times one plus 0.3, which is the same thing as 170 times 1.03. And this is a really good thing to take a hard look at 'cause you'll see it a lot when we're growing by a certain rate, when we're dealing with what turns out to be exponential functions. If we are growing, well, I almost made a mistake there, it's 1.3. So here you go, 1.3. One plus 0.3 is 1.3. So once again, take a hard look at this right over here because it's going to be something that you see a lot with exponential functions. When you grow by 30%, that means you keep your 100% that you had before, and then you add another 30%. And so you would multiply your original quantity by 130%, and 130% is the same thing as 1.3. So if you are growing by 30%, you are growing by 3/10, you would multiply your initial quantity by 1.3. So let's use that idea to keep going. So what is the population after two years? Well, you would start that second year with the population at the end of one year. So it's going to be that 170 times 1.3. And then, over that year, you're going to grow by another 30%. So if you're gonna grow by another 30%, that's equivalent to multiplying by 1.3 again. Or you could say that this is equal to 170 times 1.3 to the second power. And so I think you see where this is going. If we wanted to write a general P of t, so if we just want to write a general P of t, it's going to be whatever we started with, 170, and we're going to multiply that by 1.3 however many times, however many years have gone by. So to the t power because, for every year, we grow by 30%, which is equivalent mathematically to multiplying by 1.3. So after 100 years, it would be 170 times 1.3 to the 100th power.",math_algebra_exponential-growth-decay
"  The circle is arguably the most fundamental shape in our universe, whether you look at the shapes of orbits of planets, whether you look at wheels, whether you look at things on kind of a molecular level. The circle just keeps showing up over and over and over again. So it's probably worthwhile for us to understand some of the properties of the circle. So the first thing when people kind of discovered the circle, and you just have a look at the moon to see a circle, but the first time they said well, what are the properties of any circle? So the first one they might want to say is well, a circle is all of the points that are equal distant from the center of the circle. All of these points along the edge are equal distant from that center right there. So one of the first things someone might want to ask is what is that distance, that equal distance that everything is from the center? Right there. We call that the radius of the circle. It's just the distance from the center out to the edge. If that radius is 3 centimeters, then this radius is going to be 3 centimeters. And this radius is going to be 3 centimeters. It's never going to change. By definition, a circle is all of the points that are equal distant from the center point. And that distance is the radius. Now the next most interesting thing about that, people might say well, how fat is the circle? How wide is it along its widest point? Or if you just want to cut it along its widest point, what is that distance right there? And it doesn't have to be just right there, I could have just as easily cut it along its widest point right there. I just wouldn't be cutting it like some place like that because that wouldn't be along its widest point. There's multiple places where I could cut it along its widest point. Well, we just saw the radius and we see that widest point goes through the center and just keeps going. So it's essentially two radii. You got one radius there and then you have another radius over there. We call this distance along the widest point of the circle, the diameter. So that is the diameter of the circle. It has a very easy relationship with the radius. The diameter is equal to two times the radius.  Now, the next most interesting thing that you might be wondering about a circle is how far is it around the circle? So if you were to get your tape measure out and you were to measure around the circle like that, what's that distance? We call that word the circumference of the circle. Now, we know how the diameter and the radius relates, but how does the circumference relate to, say, the diameter. And if you're not really used to the diameter, it's very easy to figure out how it relates to the radius. Well, many thousands of years ago, people took their tape measures out and they keep measuring circumferences and radiuses. And let's say when their tape measures weren't so good, let's say they measured the circumference of the circle and they would get well, it looks like it's about 3. And then they measure the radius of the circle right here or the diameter of that circle, and they'd say oh, the diameter looks like it's about 1. So they would say -- let me write this down. So we're worried about the ratio -- let me write it like this. The ratio of the circumference to the diameter.  So let's say that somebody had some circle over here -- let's say they had this circle, and the first time with not that good of a tape measure, they measured around the circle and they said hey, it's roughly equal to 3 meters when I go around it. And when I measure the diameter of the circle, it's roughly equal to 1. OK, that's interesting. Maybe the ratio of the circumference of the diameter's 3. So maybe the circumference is always three times the diameter. Well that was just for this circle, but let's say they measured some other circle here. It's like this -- I drew it smaller. Let's say that on this circle they measured around it and they found out that the circumference is 6 centimeters, roughly -- we have a bad tape measure right then. Then they find out that the diameter is roughly 2 centimeters. And once again, the ratio of the circumference of the diameter was roughly 3. OK, this is a neat property of circles. Maybe the ratio of the circumference to the diameters always fixed for any circle. So they said let me study this further. So they got better tape measures. When they got better tape measures, they measured hey, my diameter's definitely 1. They say my diameter's definitely 1, but when I measure my circumference a little bit, I realize it's closer to 3.1.  And the same thing with this over here. They notice that this ratio is closer to 3.1. Then they kept measuring it better and better and better, and then they realized that they were getting this number, they just kept measuring it better and better and they were getting this number 3.14159. And they just kept adding digits and it would never repeat. It was a strange fascinating metaphysical number that kept showing up. So since this number was so fundamental to our universe, because the circle is so fundamental to our universe, and it just showed up for every circle. The ratio of the circumference of the diameter was this kind of magical number, they gave it a name. They called it pi, or you could just give it the Latin or the Greek letter pi -- just like that. That represents this number which is arguably the most fascinating number in our universe. It first shows up as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, but you're going to learn as you go through your mathematical journey, that it shows up everywhere. It's one of these fundamental things about the universe that just makes you think that there's some order to it. But anyway, how can we use this in I guess our basic mathematics? So we know, or I'm telling you, that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter -- when I say the ratio, literally I'm just saying if you divide the circumference by the diameter, you're going to get pi. Pi is just this number. I could write 3.14159 and just keep going on and on and on, but that would be a waste of space and it would just be hard to deal with, so people just write this Greek letter pi there. So, how can we relate this? We can multiply both sides of this by the diameter and we could say that the circumference is equal to pi times the diameter. Or since the diameter is equal to 2 times the radius, we could say that the circumference is equal to pi times 2 times the radius. Or the form that you're most likely to see it, it's equal to 2 pi r. So let's see if we can apply that to some problems. So let's say I have a circle just like that, and I were to tell you it has a radius -- it's radius right there is 3. So, 3 -- let me write this down -- so the radius is equal to 3. Maybe it's 3 meters -- put some units in there. What is the circumference of the circle? The circumference is equal to 2 times pi times the radius. So it's going to be equal to 2 times pi times the radius, times 3 meters, which is equal to 6 meters times pi or 6 pi meters. 6 pi meters. Now I could multiply this out. Remember pi is just a number. Pi is 3.14159 going on and on and on. So if I multiply 6 times that, maybe I'll get 18 point something something something. If you have your calculator you might want to do it, but for simplicity people just tend to leave our numbers in terms of pi. Now I don't know what this is if you multiply 6 times 3.14159, I don't know if you get something close to 19 or 18, maybe it's approximately 18 point something something something. I don't have my calculator in front of me. But instead of writing that number, you just write 6 pi there. Actually, I think it wouldn't quite cross the threshold to 19 yet. Now, let's ask another question. What is the diameter of the circle?  Well if this radius is 3, the diameter is just twice that. So it's just going to be 3 times 2 or 3 plus 3, which is equal to 6 meters. So the circumference is 6 pi meters, the diameter is 6 meters, the radius is 3 meters. Now let's go the other way. Let's say I have another circle. Let's say I have another circle here. And I were to tell you that its circumference is equal to 10 meters -- that's the circumference of the circle. If you were to put a tape measure to go around it and someone were to ask you what is the diameter of the circle? Well, we know that the diameter times pi, we know that pi times the diameter is equal to the circumference; is equal to 10 meters. So to solve for this we would just divide both sides of this equation by pi. The diameter would equal 10 meters over pi or 10 over pi meters. And that is just a number. If you have your calculator, you could actually divide 10 divided by 3.14159, you're going to get 3 point something something something meters. I can't do it in my head. But this is just a number. But for simplicity we often just leave it that way. Now what is the radius? Well, the radius is equal to 1/2 the diameter. So this whole distance right here is 10 over pi meters. 1If we just 1/2 of that, if we just want the radius, we 1just multiply it times 1/2. 1So you have 1/2 times 10 over pi, which is equal to 1/2 times 110, or you just divide the numerator and the 1denominator by 2. 1You get 5 there, so you get 5 over pi. 1So the radius over here is 5 over pi. 1Nothing super fancy about this. 1I think the thing that confuses people the most is to just 1realize that pi is a number. 1Pi is just 3.14159 and it just keeps going on and on and on. 1There's actually thousands of books written about pi, so 1it's not like -- I don't know if there's thousands, I'm 1exaggerating, but you could write books about this number. 1But it's just a number. 1It's a very special number, and if you wanted to write it in a 1way that you're used to writing numbers, you could literally 1just multiply this out. 1But most the time people just realize they like leaving 1things in terms of pi. 1Anyway, I'll leave you there. 1In the next video we'll figure out the area of a circle.",math_math2_circles
" What I want to do in this video is start with some point that's not on the plane, or maybe not necessarily on the plane. So let me draw a point right over here. And let's say the coordinates of that point are x 0 x sub 0, y sub 0, and z sub 0. Or it could be specified as a position vector. I could draw the position vector like this. So the position vector-- let me draw a better dotted lines. The position vector for this could be x0i plus y0j plus z0k. It specifies this coordinate right over here. What I want to do is find the distance between this point and the plane. And obviously, there could be a lot of distance. I could find the distance between this point and that point, and this point and this point, and this point this point. And when I say I want to find the distance, I want to find the minimum distance. And you're actually going to get the minimum distance when you go the perpendicular distance to the plane, or the normal distance to the plane. And we'll, hopefully, see that visually as we try to figure out how to calculate the distance. So the first thing we can do is, let's just construct a vector between this point that's off the plane and some point that's on the plane. And we already have a point from the last video that's on the plane, this x sub p, y sub p, z sub p. So let's construct a vector here. Let's construct this orange vector that starts on the plane, it's tail is on the plane, and it goes off the plane. I want to do that in orange. It goes off the plane to this vector, to this position x0 y0 z0. So how could we specify this vector, right over here? Well, that vector, let me call that vector, well, I'll just call that vector, what letters have I'm not used yet? Let me call that vector f. Vector f is just going to be this yellow position vector, minus this green position vector. So it's going to be, this x component is going to be the difference of the x-coordinates, it's y-coordinate is going the difference of the y-coordinate. S So it's going to be x0 minus x sub p. I subtracted the x-coordinates, i. Plus y0 minus ypj plus-- we'll go to the next line-- plus z0 minus zp minus zpk. So fair enough. That's just some vector that comes off of the plane and onto this point. But what we want to find out is this distance. We want to find out this distance in yellow, the distance that if I were take a normal off of the plane and go straight to the point, that's going to be the shortest distance. And actually, you can see it visually now. Because if look at-- we can actually form a right triangle here-- so this base of the right triangle is along the plane. This side is normal to the plane. So this is a right angle. And you can see, if I take any point, any other point on the plane, it will form a hypotenuse on a right triangle. And obviously the shortest side here, or the shortest way to get to the plane, is going to be this distance, right here, as opposed to the hypotenuse. This side will always be shorter than that side. So given that we know this vector here, how can we figure out this length here? How can we figure out this length here in blue? Well, we could figure out the magnitude of this vector. So the length of this side right here is going to be the magnitude of the vector, so it's going to be the magnitude of the vector f. That'll just give us this length. But we want this blue length. Well, we could think about it. If this was some angle-- I know the writing is getting small. If this was some angle theta, we could use some pretty straight up, pretty straightforward trigonometry. If the distance under question is d, you could say cosine of theta is equal to the adjacent side over the hypotenuse. Or is is equal to d-- d is the adjacent side-- is equal to d over the hypotenuse. Well, the hypotenuse is the magnitude of this vector. It's the magnitude of the vector f. Or we could say the magnitude of the vector f times the cosine of theta-- I'm just multiplying both sides times the magnitude of vector x-- f is equal to d. But still you might say, OK, well Sal, we know what f is. We can figure that out. We can figure out its magnitude. But we don't know what theta is. How do we figure out what theta? And to do that, let's just think about it a little bit. This angle, this angle of theta, is the same angle. So this distance here isn't necessarily the same as the length of the normal vector. But it's definitely going in the same direction. So this angle here, is really the same thing as the angle between this vector and the normal vector. And so you might remember from earlier linear algebra, when we talk about the dot product of two vectors, it involves something with the cosine of the angle between them. And to make that fresh in your mind, let's multiply and divide both sides. Let me multiply and divide the left side of this equation by the magnitude of the normal vector. So I'm obviously not changing its value. I'm multiplying and dividing by the same number. So I'm going to multiply by the magnitude of the normal vector. And I'm going to divide by the magnitude of the normal vector. So I'm just essentially multiplying by 1. So I have not changed this. But when you do it in this, it might ring a bell. This expression up here, this expression right here, is the dot product of the normal vector and this vector right here, f. So this right here is the dot product. This is n dot f, up there. It's equal to the product of their magnitudes times the cosine of the angle between them. So the distance, that shortest distance we care about, is a dot product between this vector, the normal vector, divided by the magnitude of the normal vector. So let's do that. Let's take the dot product between the normal and this. And we already figured out, in the last video, the normal vector, if you have the equation of a plane, the normal vector is literally, its components are just the coefficients on the x, y, and z terms. So this is a normal vector right over here. So let's literally take the dot product. So n dot f is going to be equal to A times x0 minus xp. I'll do that in pink. So it'll be Ax0 minus Axp. And then plus B times the y component here. So plus By0. I'm just distributing the B, minus Byp. And then plus-- I'll do another color here, that's too close of a color-- plus C times the z component. So plus Cz0 minus Czp. And all of that over the magnitude of the normal vector. So what's the magnitude of the normal vector going to be? It's just the square root of the normal vector dotted with itself. So it's just each of these guys squared added to themself, and you're taking the square root. So it's the square root-- maybe I can do a nicer looking radical sign than that-- of A squared plus B squared plus C squared. Now, what is this up here simplified to? Let me just rewrite this. So this is the distance in question. This right here is equal to the distance. But let's see if we can simplify it. So first, we can take all of the terms with the x0. These involve the point that sits off the plane. Remember, x0, y0, z0 sat off the plane. So this is Ax0 plus By0 plus Cz0. And then what are these terms equal to? What are these terms? Negative Axp minus Byp minus Czp? Well, if you remember here, D in the equation of in the equation of a plane, D, when we started in the last video when we tried to figure out what the normal to a plane is, D is-- if this point xp sits on the plane-- D is Axp plus Byp plus Czp. Or another way you could say it is, negative D would be negative A-- and it's just the difference between lowercase and uppercase here, right? We're saying that lowercase is the same as this uppercase A. So it's negative Axp minus Byp minus Czp. I'm just using what we got from the last video. This is what D is so negative D will be this business. And that's exactly what we have over here. We have negative Axp negative Byp negative Czp. So all of this term, this term, and this term simplifies to a minus D. And remember, this negative capital D, this is the D from the equation of the plane, not the distance d. So this is the numerator of our distance. And then the denominator of our distance is just the square root of A squared plus B squared plus C squared. And we're done. This tells us the distance between any point and a plane. And this is a pretty intuitive formula here. Because all we're doing, if I give you-- let me give you an example. Let's say I have the plane. 1If I have the plane 1x minus 2y plus 3z is equal to 5. 1So that's some plane. 1And let me pick some point that's not on the plane. 1So let's say I have the point, I don't know, let me say I have 1the 2, 2, 3. 1And let me make sure it's not on the plane. 1So it's 2 minus 6 is negative-- yeah, so this won't. 1Let me just pick a random 1. 1So this definitely is not on the plane, 1because we have 2 minus 6 plus 3. 1That gives us negative 1, which is not 5. 1So this is definitely not on the plane. 1We can find the distance between this point and the plane 1using the formula we just derived. 1We literally just evaluate at-- so this will just be 1 times 2. 1Let me use that same color. 11 times 2 minus 2 times-- I'm going 1to fill it in-- plus 3 times something, minus 5. 1All of that over, and I haven't put these guys in. 1Let me do that right now. 1So 1 times 2 minus 2 times 3 plus 3 times 1. 1This 1 minus 5, you're kind of bringing it over 1to the left hand side. 1All of that over the square root of 1 1squared, which is 1, plus negative 2 1squared, which is 4, plus 3 squared, which is 9. 1So it's going to be equal to, let's see, this is 2 minus 6, 1or negative 6. 1And then you have plus 3. 1And then minus 5. 1So this is what? 1This is 5. 12 plus 3 is 5 minus 5. 1So those cancel out. 1So this is negative 6. 1So it's equal to negative 6 over the square root of 5 1plus 9 is 14. 1Over the square root of 14. 1And you're done. 1So hopefully, you find that useful. 1And hopefully, we can apply this in the other example problems.",math_linear-algebra_vectors-and-spaces
" -  Let's talk a little bit about chemical reactions. And chemical reactions are a very big deal. Without chemical reactions, you or I would not exist. In your body right now, there are countless chemical reactions going on every second. Without chemical reactions, we would have no life, we would not even have the universe as we know it. So what are chemical reactions. Well, they're any time that you have bonds being formed or broken between atoms or molecules. So what are we talking about there? Well this is maybe one of the most fundamental chemical reactions. Once again if one never occurred, we'd be in trouble, we would not have, we would not have any water. But let's think about what it is actually describing. So over here on the left-hand side we have the reactants. Let me write that down. So here we have the reactants. These are the molecules that are going to react. And then we have an arrow that moves us to the product. So let me do that in a different color. So we have an arrow that moves us to the product, or we could say the products. And so what are the reactants here? Well we have molecular hydrogen and we have molecular oxygen. Now why did I say molecular hydrogen? Because molecular hydrogen, which is the state that you would typically find hydrogen in if you just have it by itself, it is actually made up of two hydrogen atoms. You see it right over here, one, two hydrogen atoms. And what we have in order to have this reaction, you don't just need one molecular hydrogen and one, or one molecule of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen. For every, for this reaction to happen, you actually have two molecules of molecular hydrogen. So this is actually made up of four hydrogen atoms. So let me make this clear. So this right over here, this is two molecules of molecular hydrogen. And that's why we have the two right out front of the H sub-two. This little subscript two tells us there's two of the hydrogen atoms in this molecule. And then this big, this big white two that we have right over here, that tells us that we're dealing with two of those molecules for this reaction to happen, that we need two of these molecules for every, for every molecule of molecular oxygen. And molecular oxygen, once again, this is composed of two oxygen atoms. One, two. So under the right conditions, so you need a little bit of energy to make this happen. If under the right conditions these two things are going to react. And actually it's very, very reactive, molecular hydrogen and molecular oxygen. So much so that it's actually used for rocket fuel. You are going to produce two molecules of water. We see that right over here. And look, I did not create or destroy any atoms. I had one, I had one, I had one oxygen atom here. It was part of the oxygen molecule right here, then I have the second one right over here now. Now they are part of separate molecules. I had, I had a, I had one two, three, four hydrogens. I now have one, two, three, four hydrogens, just like that. And actually this produces a... So we could say some energy, and I'm being inexact right over here. Some energy and then we could say a lot of energy. A lot of energy. So this is a reaction that you just give it a little bit of a kick-start and it really wants to happen. A lot, a lot of energy. So one thing that you might wonder, and this is something that I first wondered when I learned about reactions, well how do, how does this happen? You know, is this a very organized thing? You know, do these molecules somehow know to react with each other? And the answer's no. Chemistry is a incredibly messy thing. You have these things bouncing around, they have energy. They're bouncing around all over the place and actually when you provide energy, they're gonna bounce around even more rigorously, enough so that they collide in the right ways so that they break their old bonds and then they form these new bonds. So whenever you see these reactions in biology or chemistry class, keep that in mind. It looks all neat and organized but in a real system, these are all of these things just bouncing around in all different crazy ways. And that's why energy's an important thing here. Because the more energy you apply to the system, the more that they're going to bounce around, the more that they're going to interact with each other. The more reactants you put in, the more chance they're going to bounce around and be able to react with each other. Now I'm gonna introduce another word that you're gonna see in chemistry a lot. This water, these two... We see we have two water molecules here. We could call them molecules, but since they are actually made up of two or more different elements, we could also call this a compound. So water, water is, you could call it a molecule, or you could call it a compound. So this is a molecule or compound, while this molecular hydrogen, you would not call this a compound. And this molecular oxygen, of course it's a molecule, but you would not call it a compound either. And just to get an appreciation of how much energy this produces, let me just show you this picture right over here. That's the space shuttle and this, this big tank right over here, let me... This big tank contains a bunch of liquid oxygen and hydrogen. And to create this incredible amount of energy, it actually just... You mix the two together with a little bit of energy and then you produce a ton of energy that makes the rocket, that makes the space shuttle. Well, space shuttle's been discontinued now, but back when they did it, to make it get it's necessary, it's necessary velocity. Now let's talk about the idea. So, you know, this reaction, strongly goes in this, in the direction of going to water. But it can actually go the other way, but it's very, very hard for it to go the other way. So in general we would consider this to be an irreversible reaction, even though it is. You know irreversible sounds like, hey you can't go the other way. It just really means that it's very unlikely to go the other way. You have to supply a lot of energy to go the other way. To make this reaction go the other way, you would have to do something called electrolysis, you provide energy, etcetera, etcetera. But in general, the way that this is written, because the arrow is only pointing in one direction, this is implying that it is irreversible. Irreversible. Irreversible. Which probably makes you think, well what about reversible reactions? And I have an example of a reversible reaction, right over here. I have a one bicarbonate ion. And the word ion, that's just used to describe any molecule or atom that has either, has an imbalance of electrons or protons that cause it to have a net charge. So this makes this an ion, and actually right over here, this is a hydrogen, this is a hydrogen ion right over here. Both of these are charged. One has a positive charge, one has a negative charge. But they are both, they are both ions. And this reactions right over here, you have the bicarbonate ion that looks something like this. This is just my hand-drawing of it. Reacting with a hydrogen ion, it's really a hydrogen atom that has lost it's electron, so some people would even say this is a proton right over here. This is an equilibrium reaction, where it can form carbonic acid. And notice all that's happening is this hydrogen is attaching to one of the oxygens over here. And this is an equilibrium because if in an actual, in an actual solution, it's going back and forth. If you actually provide more reactants, you're gonna go more in that direction. If you provide more of the products over here, then you're gonna go in that direction. And so in an actual, in an actual environment, in an actual system, it's constantly going back and forth between these two things. And different reversible reactions might tend to one side or the other. If you provide more of the stuff on one side, it might go more in the other directions because these are gonna, they're gonna be more likely to interact, Or if you provide more of this, it might go in the other direction because these might more likely react with their surroundings or disassociate in some way. Now just to get a sense of, you know, it's nice to kind of, you know, are these just some random letters that I wrote here? Carbonic acid is actually an incredibly important molecule, or we could call it a compound because it's made up of two or, two or more elements, in living systems and in fact, you know, even in the environment. And even when you go out to get some fast food. When you have carbonated drinks, it has carbonic acid in it that disassociates into carbon dioxide and that carbon dioxide is what you see bubbling up. Carbonic acid is incredibly important in how your body deals with excess carbon dioxide in its bloodstream. Carbonic acid is involved in the oceans taking up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. So when you're studying chemistry, especially in the context of biology, these aren't just, you know, interesting things that seem very academic. These are effecting your real life and your body and your environment.",science_ap-chemistry_stoichiometry-and-molecular-composition-ap
" -  We are asked what fraction is located at point A on the number line? And we can see point A right there. Pause this video and see if could answer that. All right, now there's a bunch of ways that you could think about it. You could see that the space between zero and one is split into one, two, three, four equal spaces. And this has gone three of those four equal spaces from zero to one. So that's one interesting way to think about it. Another thing that might help us is a bit of a visualization. If this rectangle represents a whole and notice it goes from zero to one, so you could view one as a whole, we have split it into four equal sections. So each of these equal sections you would consider a fourth. So that's a fourth right over there. That's another fourth right over there. This is another fourth right over there. So how many of these fourths have been shaded in? Well three of them have been shaded in. And when you look at the number line, you see the same idea. When we see the space between zero and one it has been split into fourths. So this is a fourth, and then another fourth, and then another fourth, and another fourth. And where is point A? Well we have gone 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 past zero or from zero to one, which is a whole. So what fraction is located at point A on the number line? 3/4. Let's do another example. So here we're told which point is at 2/6 on the number line. Pause this video and see if you can answer on your own before we work through it together. And I'll give you a little bit of a hint. Let's imagine that this rectangle represents a whole and notice it is divided into six equal sections so each of those sections is 1/6. And so if I start at zero, how many would I fill in to get 2/6? And what would be the corresponding point on the number line? All right, now let's do it together. So if each of these is a sixth, and we have 6/6 there so that would be a whole and that's good because it goes from zero to one and you can view one as a whole. 2/6 is, so that's 1/6 right over there and then that is 2/6. And so you can see on the number line, the thing that gets us 2/6 of the way to one is at point B. It corresponds to how much we've filled up that rectangle, point B right over there. Now another way that you could think about it, you could see that the space between zero and one is split up into six equal sections. One, two, three, four, five, six equal sections. And we want to go to 2/6. 2/6. So each of those equal sections, we are increasing by a sixth. So we're going from zero to 1/6 to 2/6. Once again we end up at point B.",math_in-in-class-3rd-math-cbse_imp-fractions
" In this video I want to give you an example of what it means to fit data to a line. Instead of doing my traditional video using my little pen tablet, I'm going to do it straight on Excel so you could see how to do this for yourself, so if you have Excel or some other type of a spreadsheet program. We're not going to go into the math of it. I really just want you to get the conceptual understanding of what it means to fit data with line, or do a linear regression. So here, let's just read the problem. The following table shows the median California income-- remember median is the middle, the middle California income --from 1995 to 2002 as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. Draw a scatter plot and find the equation. What would you expect the median annual income of a California family to be in the year 2010? What are the meanings of the slope and the y-intercept of this problem? So the first thing you'd want to do-- I just copied and pasted this image --we have to get the data in a form that the spreadsheet can understand it. So let's make some tables here. Let's say years since 1995. Let's make that one column. Let me make this a little bit wider. Then let me put median income. This is the median income in California for a family. So we start off with 1 year, or 0 years since 1995, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Actually if you want, it'll figure out the trend if you just keep going down. It'll figure out you're just incrementing by 1. Then the income, I'll just copy in these numbers right there. So that's $53,807, $55,217, $55,209, $55,415 $63,100, $63,206, $63,761, and then we have $65,766. So I don't need these over here. So I'm going to get rid of them. I can clear them. So let me make sure I have enough entries. This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 entries. I want to make sure I got my data right. $53,807, $55,217, $55,209, 415, 100, 206, 761, 766. OK, there we go. Now you're going to find that in Excel this is incredibly easy if you know what to click on. One, plot this data, create a scatter plot, and then even better, create a regression of that data. So all you have to do is you select the data. Then you go to insert, and I'm going to insert a scatter plot. Then you can pick the different types of scatter plots. I just want to plot the data. There you go. It plotted the data for me. There you go. If you go by this is the actual income, and this is by year since 1995. So this is 1995. It was $53,807. In 1996 it's $55,217. So it plotted all the data. Now what I want to do is fit a line. So this isn't exactly a line. But let's see, if we assume that a line can model this data well, I'm going to get Excel to fit a line for me. So what I can do is I have all of these options up here for different ways to fit a line, all of these different options. I'm going to pick this one here. You might not be able to see it. It looks like it has a line between dots. It also has fx which tells me going to tell me the equation of the line. So if I click on that, there you go. It not only fit, it replotted that same data on a different graph. Let me make it a little bit bigger. No, I don't want to that. Let me make it a little bit bigger. We can cover up the data now, just because I think we know what's going on. So let me cover it up right like that. So not only did it plot the various data points, it actually fit a line to that data and it gave me the equation of that line. Let me see if I can make this a little bit bigger. I'll move it out of the way so you can read it at least. So it tells me right here, that the equation for this line is y is equal to 1,882.3x plus 52,847. So if you remember what we know about slope and y-intercept, the y-intercept is 52,847, which is, if you use this line as your measure, where this line intersects at year 0, or in 1995. So if you use this line as a model, in 1995 the line would say that you're going to make $52,847. The actual data was a little bit off of that. It was a little bit higher, $53,807. So it was a little bit higher. But we're trying to get a line that gets as close as possible to all of this data. It's actually trying to minimize the distance, the square of the distance, between each of these points in the line. We won't go into the math there. But it gave us this nice equation. Now we can use this nice equation to predict things. If we say that this is a good a model for the data-- let me bring this down a little bit --let's try to answer our question. So we drew a scatter plot-- really Excel did it for us. We found the equation right there. They say, what would you expect the median annual income of a California family to be in the year 2010? So here, we can just use the equation they gave us. This right here, was 2002. So I could write down the year. This was the year of 2002. So the year 2010 is 8 more years. Let me make a little column here. So this is the year, 1995, 1996. Then Excel will be able to figure out if I select those, and I go to this little bottom right square and I scroll down, Excel will actually figure out that I want to increment by 1 year every time. If I say years since 1995, once again I can just continue this trend right here. So 2010 would be 15 years. So we can just apply this equation. We could say it's going to be equal to, according to this line-- I'm just going to type it in, hopefully you can read what I'm saying --1,882.3 times x. x here is the year since 1995. I could just select this cell, or I could type in the number 15. That means times this cell, times 15. Then plus 52,847, plus that right there. Click enter and it predicts $81,081.50. So if you just continue this line for another 8 or so years, it predicts that the median income in California for a family will be $81,000. Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting. Spreadsheets are very useful tools for manipulating data. It'll give you a sense of why linear models are interesting, why lines are interesting, and how you can actually use these tools to interpret data and maybe even extrapolate some type of a prediction. This right here, is an extrapolation using this linear regression.",math_cc-eighth-grade-math_cc-8th-linear-equations-functions
" -  In a previous video, we introduced ourselves to the idea of bonds and the idea of ionic bonds, where one atom essentially is able to take electrons from another atom. But then because one becomes positively charged and the other becomes negatively charged, they get attracted to each other. Now we're going to go to the other end of the bonding spectrum, where instead of stealing electrons from each other, we're going to share them. Let's say we're dealing with two oxygen atoms. So let me draw one oxygen here. A neutral oxygen has eight electrons total, but six of them are in its outer shell. So it has one, two, three, four, five, six valence electrons. And the way that I arrange them is I pair them up last. So you have these two valence electrons that are not paired with another electron. And now let me draw another oxygen, and I'm going do it with a different color, so we can keep track of the electrons. So another oxygen right over there, also has six valence electrons, one, two, three, four, five, six valence electrons. Now this oxygen on the left, in order to become more stable, it would love to somehow gain or maybe share two more electrons. And of course, this oxygen on the right, it's still oxygen. It also would love to gain or share two more valence electrons. So how could it do it? Well, what if the oxygen on the left shared this electron and this electron with the oxygen on the right, and the oxygen on the right shared this electron and this electron with the oxygen on the left? Well, if they did that, you would have something that looks like this. You have your oxygen on the left. You have the oxygen on the right. And the way we show two electrons that are being shared, let's say these two electrons are being shared, is just a line like this. This shows that there are two electrons that are being shared by these two oxygens. And let's say that these two electrons are also being shared. You would do that with a line like this. And then we could draw the remainder of the valence electrons. This oxygen on the left had, outside of the electrons that are being shared, it had four more valence electrons. And then the oxygen on the right had four more valence electrons, one, two, three, four. Now what's interesting here is the shared electrons, these are going to cause these oxygens to stick together. If they don't stick together, these electrons aren't going to be shared. So what we have formed here is known as a covalent bond, covalent bond. And what's interesting is it allows both of these oxygens in some ways to be more stable. From the left oxygen's point of view, it had six valence electrons, but now it's able to share two more. Remember, each of these bonds, each of these lines represent two electrons. So this oxygen could say, hey, I get to have one, two, three, four, six, eight electrons that I'm dealing with, and the same thing is going to be true of this oxygen on the right. Now there are some covalent bonds that are between not-so-equals. So for example, if we're talking about water and if we're talking about how oxygen bonds with hydrogen. So if we have oxygen right over here, once again, I can draw its six valence electrons, one, two, three, four, five, and let me just draw the sixth one right over there. And if I have hydrogen, hydrogen has one valence electron. So let's say that's a hydrogen right over there with one valence electron, maybe another hydrogen right over there with one valence electron. Oxygen and hydrogen form covalent bonds. In fact, that is how water is formed. And so what would that look like? Well, it would look like this. You have oxygen right over here. You have these two pairs of electrons that I keep drawing. And then this electron right over here could be shared with the hydrogen, and that hydrogen's electron could be shared with the oxygen. So that forms a covalent bond with this hydrogen. And then this electron from the oxygen can be shared with the hydrogen, and that electron from the hydrogen can be shared with the oxygen. And so that would form a covalent bond with that other hydrogen. And now here, once again, oxygen can kinda pretend like it has eight valence electrons, two, four, six, eight. And the hydrogens can kind of pretend that it has two valence electrons. But the one difference here is that oxygen is a lot more electronegative than hydrogen. It's to the right of hydrogen. It's in this top-right corner, outside of, other than the noble gases, that really like to hog electrons. So what do you think is going to happen here? Well, the electrons in each of these covalent bonds are going to hang out around the oxygen more often than around the hydrogen. So if the electrons spend more time around the oxygen, you're going to have, in general, more negative charge around the oxygen. And so you're going to have a partial negative charge on the oxygen end of the water molecule, and then you're going to have partial positive charges on the hydrogen ends of the molecules. And in case you're curious, that little symbol I'm using for partial, that's the lowercase Greek letter delta, which is just the convention in chemistry. And so this type of covalent bond, because there is some polarity, one side has more charge than the other, this is known as a polar covalent bond, polar covalent bond.",science_ap-biology_chemistry-of-life
" -  We spent some time talking about hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons are interesting especially if you want to combust things, if you want some fuel, but now we're going to make things a little bit more interesting by adding things to the hydrocarbons and the things we're gonna add we call functional groups. Functional groups. And my goal in my video is to give you an overview of the major functional groups that you might see attached to carbon backbones that make the molecules interesting biologically. Now, the first one I will focus on is an OH group. So, we have an OH attached to a carbon backbone over here. It doesn't have to be attached to a carbon backbone but the OH right over here, this is called a hydroxyl group. Hy, hydroxyl group, and when it is attached to a carbon backbone like this one is then it turns the entire molecule into an alcohol. Alcohol. This an alcohol. And this one in particular if you want the name we have two carbons on the longest, longest chain and it is an alcohol so we use the prefix Eth for the two carbons. So, let me write that down. We're going to use the prefix Eth because we have two carbons here. And we're gonna say Ethanol. Now, what are the properties here? Well, you have oxygen which is very electronegative bonded to a hydrogen and to a carbon but the oxygen is a lot more electronegative than the hydrogen so you're going to have a partially negative charge at this end away from the hydrogen. A partial positive charge at the hydrogen and to a lesser degree the carbon end too but hydrogen is even less, is a less electronegative than even carbon. And this one, so, a hydroxyl group they are polar, they are polar, and because they are polar you can dissolve them into water. They are hydrophilic. They can form hydrogen bonds so that you can dissolve this. Now, similar, a similar functional group or one that has somewhat similar properties is right over here. And you might say, ""Wait, why is this one similar? ""I have sulfur here instead of oxygen."" But if you look at the periodic table you will see that sulfur and oxygen both have six valence electrons. They both would love nothing more than to grab or pretend to grab two other electrons and this is why they form, they tend to form two covalent bonds. And so, this group right over here, which is called a sulfhydryl group. This is a sulf.... Sulfhydryl. Sulfhydryl group. It's kind of similar to a hydroxyl group with the one difference, with the one difference that sulfur is electronegative but it is less electronegative than oxygen. So, you're still gonna have a partially negative charge and a partially positive charge, but it's going to be less polar. So, it's not quite as polar as if you had a hydroxyl group. Now, when you have this sulfhydryl group it's attached to, say, a carbon chain and when I use this R right over here, when I have this R. This is just shorthand for carbon and a bunch of other stuff. I could've, if I wanted to generalize an alcohol right over here I could've written R and then I could've written the hydroxyl group. O and then bond that, bond that to an H. So, over here the shorthand R would have been the shorthand for all of... The R would've been the shorthand for all of this business. All of this business right over here. And so that's what we're doing over there. I'm not saying that this R is exactly this. It means that some carbon backbone and some carbons, hydrogens, and maybe other stuff, maybe even some other functional groups, but we're just focused on the sulfhydryl right over here. And so if you see something like this, you'd say ""Okay, yeah, this is still going to be polar, ""but not quite as polar as if I were dealing ""with a hydroxyl group."" Now over here we have a more complex molecule, but this is a molecule that you run into probably on a daily basis. This is the sugar fructose. This is the sugar fructose. And this is when it is not in a ring. If you were to throw this into-- If you were to throw this into water, it'll readily form a ring, but when it is not in a ring form you can recognize already the hydroxyl groups. You have a hydroxyl group on this carbon. You have a hydroxyl group on this carbon. Hydroxyl group on this carbon. You have a hydroxyl group on that carbon. You have a hydroxyl group on this carbon. And then, on this carbon, it's double bonded to an oxygen. We call this a carbonyl group. So this is a carbonyl. Carbonyl. Carbonyl group. Now this is actually how you would tell a sugar, it's like, look, especially when it's in a straight chain, all my carbons have one hydroxyl on them except for this one, it has a carbonyl group. And one of the take aways for a carbonyl group, we've already talked about oxygen being very electronegative, even more electronegative than carbon, it's double bonds, it's going to hog the electrons on the oxygen end, so you're going to have a partially negative charge. Partially negative charge over here, partially positive charge over here, and so this, this one is also going to be polar. And then, in fact, the entire molecule is very polar because it has all these hydroxyl groups on it as well, but this is also going to give it polarity here and, because this carbon has a slightly positive charge, it is susceptible to nucleophilic attack, and when you take organic chemistry, you'll see that things that want to share-- That have a predisposition to share their electrons in a bond might want to come and form a bond with this carbon and maybe one of these electron pairs go back to this oxygen and maybe bond with something else, but we'll talk about it in the future when we study some organic chemistry mechanisms. The important thing here is just recognize, ""Okay, I've got some hydroxyl groups? ""Okay, I've got a carbonyl group right over here as well."" Now this molecule, this is an amino acid, and you will see amino acids a lot when you study biology. And this has actually a couple of interesting groups on it. The first group of note is this stuff that I am circling in orange because you have a carbon that, you could say it's part of a carbonyl group, but it is also bound to a hydroxyl group. It is also bound to a hydroxyl group right over there. And when you have this configuration where you have a carbon bond double-bonded to an oxygen and then single-bonded to a hydroxyl group, we call this a carboxyl group. This is a carboxyl. Carboxyl, carboxyl group. And one of the take aways from this is that it is acidic because this can readily give up the hydrogen proton. This oxygen, we already know oxygen likes to hog electrons, it can take up both of these electrons and become negative, and actually, there's actually resoce here because those electrons get shared throughout the group and actually even potentially even beyond the group but especially inside of the group, then leaving the hydrogen proton. So this can readily donate a hydrogen proton... This can readily donate a hydrogen proton, so this is generally viewed as acidic. Acidic. Now, this amino acid over here, it also, and this is where this name comes from, actually the acid comes from this carboxyl group, this is the acidic part, and then you have an animo group. You have an amino group right, right over here. And because it's involving a nitrogen, this is the amino group. This is what gives the amino part of the name amino acid. Amino acid. And this actually is generally basic. Because nitogen could-- It has a lone pair. It has a lone pair of electrons right over here. And so it could use that lone pair to pick up, to form a bond with a hydrogen ion, to pick up a hydrogen ion. So, under the right circumstances, it can form a bond with a hydrogen ion, which, we know, a positive ion, which would just be a proton, and so it would have a positive charge. And so since it can sop up hydrogen ions, we can view this, the amino group, as being basic. But this right over here is leucine, it's an amino acid super important for muscle growth, but there you can appreciate. You have essentially a hydrocarbon chain, but it has a carboxyl group at this end and an animo group right over here. And another thing that you'll sometimes people talk about is even hydrocarbon groups. For example, if you consider the main chain of this, and we could consider to either using this carbon or this carbon, but if we consider this to be the main chain of carbons, if we consider that to be the main chain of carbons, then we would consider this right over here to be a methyl group. Remember, the prefix ""meth"" refers to one carbon, so it's one carbon bonded to a bunch of hydrogens, to three hydrogens here, and so we would call this a methyl group. And in general, if you have a hydrocarbon bonded to other hydrocarbon groups, these things are hydrophobic. So these things, there's nothing polar about them, and so they're not going to want to, at least these parts of the molecule are not going to naturally dissolve inside of water. Now the last group we're going to focus on, and you're going to see a lot of these, and especially in biology, you're going to see this as a part of ATP, you're going to see it's the backbone of DNA, and that's phosphate groups. And this right over here, this right over here is the phosphate group. I've drawn it bonded to a bunch of, kind of a group over here, who knows what it is, bunch of carbons, a bunch of other things, and then I've bonded it to two hydrogens, but it doesn't always have to be bound to hydrogens. But when it is bound to hydrogens like this, it's considered to be protonated, and so it can actually take up, it can actually hog these electrons and dump these hydrogens, and dump these hydrogens into a solution. So a phosphate group is considered to be acidic. It is considered as well, especially when it is protonated like this, it is considered to be acidic because it can donate protons. So this is just an overview of a lot of the functional groups you will see throughout biology and a lot of big, hairy complex molecules, when you actually break it down, you say, ""Okay, there's a hydrocarbon chain there. ""Oh, I see a sugar there! ""I see a bunch of hydroxyls, and I have a carbonyl group. ""Oh, I see an amine group, I see-- 1""Or, amino group. 1""I see a carboxyl group."" 1You can think about this going to be acidic? 1Is it going to be polar? 1Or do different parts of the molecule 1have different functions?",science_biology_properties-of-carbon
" -  We are asked, which of the following correctly identifies the areas of consumer surplus, producer surplus, tax revenue, and deadweight loss in this market after the tax? So pause this video, have a go at it. Even if you struggle with it it will make your brain more attuned to when we work through it together. All right, now let's work through this together. And I just want to sort of understand what's going on here before I even try to answer their questions. So let's first take a look at what's going on before the tax. So before the tax, I have this supply curve right over here in blue. And I have this demand curve. Where they intersect gives us our equilibrium price. Right over here. And our equilibrium quantity right over there. And if we wanted to look at the consumer surplus it would be the area above this horizontal line. And, below the demand curve. So that is our original consumer surplus. And our original producer surplus is above the supply curve and below this price horizontal line. And so, the total surplus would be this entire triangle right over here. All before the tax. But they're not asking us before the tax they want us to figure out everything after the tax. So what happens to the tax? Well, if we assume it's a tax on each unit that is being supplied. The effect it has, and we see it here, they've drew it for us. Is it shifts the effective supply curve up. And I say the effective one because that's the one that's going to affect the equilibrium price, or the new equilibrium price. But as we'll see there's some nuances in terms of considering the surplus. So first, let's think about the consumer. Well, actually let me label the now price with the taxes. So, this is now the R equilibrium price where we have the taxes. It's where our demand curve hasn't shifted. That's where the existing demand curve intersects with this new shifted supply with tax curve. And similarly, that point of intersection also tells us our quantity with the taxes. Now, now that we've understood everything, or hopefully we have, let's think about the various surpluses and the deadly weight losses and the tax revenues. So first, let's think about the consumer surplus. Well, the consumer surplus is going to be the region above our new horizontal price. And below the demand curve. So that is this region R right over here. That still, you have this consumer right over here who was willing to pay a lot but still has to pay less than that even with the taxes. So they're getting this benefit more than they would have needed in order, it would have been willing to pay more than the tax, and so they're getting this surplus. And so if you look at the entire market right now the total consumer surplus after the tax is R. R is equal to consumer surplus. And this is all after the taxes. Consumer surplus. Now, what about the producer surplus? Well, if we weren't dealing with the tax we would just look above the supply curve and below this equilibrium price line and say hey, maybe it's that area. But remember what's happening from the producers point of view. The producer does not see this new increased price at this quantity. The producer, remember, they don't get to keep the tax revenue. That, they have to give to the government. So the producer actually this is the price that the producer sees. So you can see this is this is what what producers what producers get after taxes. After taxes, or I say net of taxes. May be a better way to think about it. Net of taxes. And so the producer surplus is going to be the area below what they're getting from the market, net of taxes. And above what they the price is at which they were willing to produce various quantities. And so the producer surplus is this area of V over here. So, V is equal to the producer. Producer surplus. And now, what about the tax revenue? Well, the tax revenue is, is essentially going to be all of this other part of the total surplus. This is what goes to the government. The difference between these two. If the producers did not have to give that tax to the government then they wouldn't have been able to keep all of this. But this, right over here. Let me do this in a different color. So this region, right over here, is what the government is able to keep. Notice, it's this quantity and they get this much tax per unit quantity. And so this area is the government, is the revenue to the government. So, S plus U is equal to tax revenue. Tax revenue. And then last but not least, what about the deadweight loss? Well remember, the deadweight loss is the difference between the original the total surplus. When we just let things naturally go to equilibrium. The difference between that and now our new total surplus, which is now lower because we have not allowed the market to function in a very natural way because of this tax on it. Well, as we said before, the original total surplus was this entire triangle. Now the total surplus is this trapezoid that's the sum of all of these areas. And so what we lost is this area right over here. So that is the deadweight loss. So T plus W is equal to the deadweight loss. And we're done.",economics-finance-domain_microeconomics_consumer-producer-surplus
" -  What we're going to do in this video is some examples converting between liters and milliliters and just as a reminder, milli means one-thousandth so a milliliter is one-thousandth of a liter, or another way to think about it, one liter is 1000 milliliters. So given that, how many milliliters would seven liters be? Pause the video and think about that. Well if one liter is 1000 milliliters, then seven liters would be 7000 milliliters. And what about 18 liters? Pause the video and think about it. Well that would be 18,000 milliliters. So however many liters you've got it would be a thousand times as many milliliters because each milliliter is one-thousandth of a liter. Let's do some more examples. So here it says blank milliliters equals 15 liters. Pause the video again, see if you can figure this out. Well remember, every liter is a thousand milliliters. So 15 liters would be 15,000 milliliters. Remember, if you have a smaller unit, and here you're smaller by a factor of a thousand, the number that you would need of it to have the same as a large unit would be larger. So you have a smaller unit, so you have a larger number here. Let's do one more example. Compare using greater than, less than, or equal to. So nine liters, how does that compare to 90 milliliters? Pause this video and try to answer it for yourself. Well how many milliliters is nine liters? Nine liters is the same thing as 9,000 milliliters and 9,000 milliliters is clearly greater than 90 milliliters. So what you want to do in a problem like this is convert both to milliliters. 9,000 milliliters, that's what nine liters is, that's 9,000 milliliters, that's going to be greater than 90 milliliters.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_imp-measurement-and-data-2
" Ten of us have been abducted by aliens because they view us as being representative of the human race. And what they're going to do is they're going to test us to see if the human race is worthy of joining the intergalactic council of planets. And if we're not, they're going to kill us all and and turn Earth into a mushroom farm, because that's their oil. So they take us together in their spaceship and they say, you ten represent all of humanity, and the fate of humanity rests in your hands. And we'll give you a test. And the test is tomorrow. 24 hours from right now, we're going to put you all in a completely dark room, and line you all up one behind the other. So if this is one guy-- let me see if I can draw-- so if this is the guy in the front. He's looking a little worried. Someone described me as the Bob Ross of mathematics. So I'll attempt to do a little Bob Ross work right here. So this would be the first of us. He has a business tie on, and whatever. He's facing in this direction. And then there's ten more of them. So instead of redrawing them, let me just copy and paste it. We all look mysteriously similar to each other. That's the second one. And the third one. There's ten of us like this. I'll do one more. Oh that's good enough. There's ten of us, and we're essentially lined up front to back, so that this guy, all he sees is the back of this guy's head. And he can also see the back of this guy's head. Maybe there's a slight incline, maybe the floor is like this. Let me see if I can draw it. The floor is at a slight tilt, so one guy is standing right here. Another guy is standing right here. Another guy's standing right here. There's ten of us in a line. We're all facing in that direction. All this guy right here can see is the wall. This guy can see the two guys in front of him. This guy can see the one guy in front of him. There's ten of them. It goes all the way back to ten So what they tell us is we're going to line you up like this. They even draw a nice diagram like this, because they want to give us a fair chance of preventing Earth from turning into a mushroom farm. And they say, while the room is completely pitch dark, we're going to place a hat on each of your heads. And the hat will either be mauve-- so this would be a mauve hat. Or they'll be green. So they either get a mauve or a green hat on the back of your head. And the hat will be designed in such a way, it won't have a big rim. So that you can't look up and see your hat. This is alien technology, so it is completely impossible to see the hat on your own head. And the distribution of the hats will be random. It could be all green hats. It could be all-- well, I'll say purple-- because I'm not quite sure how to pronounce mauve. So it could be all purple hats, it could be half purple, half green. It could be nine green and one purple. They don't know. It could be any combination of hats. And what they're going to do-- and they tell us all of this-- is that they're going to start with the person in the back. So this is the front wall, this is the floor. This is the first guy right here, second guy, third guy, fourth guy, fifth guy, sixth guy, seven, eight, nine. So there's the tenth guy. They're all faced in that direction. They're going to start with this guy right here. And say, what color is the hat on your head? And he'll answer, either purple or green. He can only say purple or green. I have to be exact here. He can only say purple or green. And he can say it as loud as he wants. But he has to say it at an even tone, so that not more information can be conveyed, other than the fact that he thinks his hat is purple or green. Although this guy is close enough that he can hear it. Everyone's going to hear what everyone's going to say. But there's no intonation. And if you're right, if you say, my hat is purple and you are wearing a purple hat, you will live. And the 600 million people that you represent will also live. And where they live will not be turned into a mushroom farm. And if you're wrong, then they will immediately-- what is that Star Trek weapon? Displace you. And they'll also do it to all the people you represent. And turn all of their land into mushroom farms. So there's this huge incentive to try to get this right. So they say, we're going to do this tomorrow. And your goal, obviously, is to try to save as many lives as you can. And so we're going to put you in a room, and you guys can discuss this for the next 24 hours, to come up with a system so that when we put you in the dark room and we put the hats on each of your heads. I shouldn't be drawing brown hats. We'll put the hats on your head. And then turn on the lights. I forgot to tell you that. They're going to put us in a dark room, you can't see anything, we're all lined up. Then they're going to turn on the lights. And so then they'll ask this guy, what color is the hat on your head? He obviously can't look at his own head, but he'll see everyone else's hats. And likewise this guy, he can't see his own hat, and he can't see the guy behind him. But he'll hear what this guy says, and he can see all of the hats in front of him. So they'll turn on the lights, and then after this guy-- if he's right he lives, if he's wrong he'll be displaced. And then they'll go to the next guy. And then ask him. If he's right he lives, and all the people he represents lives. If he's wrong he also will get displaced. And they'll keep going all the way up to the first guy. So our goal to essentially save civilization, or at least human civilization, is to come up with a system to save as many of us as possible. So that's the first take of the brain teaser. So if you want to kind of pause it right here. And actually before you pause it, let me just clarify. All you can say is either purple or green. No intonations. You can't say ""pur-puuul"" or ""purp-l"" to kind of convey any type of information. All you can say is purple or green. Or pronounce it in some weird way. And there's no weird trick where you can kind of look with the side of your eyes or anything like this. You have to do it completely based on what you hear and what you say. And if the aliens catch any hint of you guys trying to cheat. Or all of us. I'm one of us. To cheat this, they'll just evaporate everything and turn everything into mushroom farms. So that's the problem statement. How do you save as many people as possible? And if you want to pause now, feel free to do so. And now I'll give you kind of a small hint, because this doesn't help you. It's easy to think of a lot of solutions that might save a couple of people. But there's actually a solution that will guarantee saving nine people. So that's the solution that you have to come up with. And for the rest of this video I'm just going to keep giving hints, and then eventually give you the solution. So the goal is actually really to save nine people. And you can which nine people it's going to be. And so once again, pause it if you don't want any more hints. It's going to be these nine people. These nine people are guaranteed to be saved. And this guy obviously is just going to be guessing. He is the first guy to be asked what color his hat is. He has no information. He can see the people in front of him, but he has absolutely no information as to what color this hat is. So he just guesses. So there's a 50% chance that he's right. Without any other information, we assume that there's a 50-50 chance that the hat on the top of your head is a purple or a green one. So your expected number of people you're going to save is nine and a half. With the system. So these people are guaranteed to be saved. And so, there's a couple of things that are more probabilistic that don't quite get you there. That might come to mind immediately. And once again, stop this video. Because it's fun to think of these yourself. But this guy might just see, OK how many green hats are there, and how many purple hats are there? And then whichever there are more of, he might say, oh my hat is-- let's say there's six purple and three green in front of him-- he might say my hat is purple. And he's either right or wrong, and he might get displaced. But at least he'll have conveyed that information to the rest of the group. That hey, the majority of the hats are purple, so you're better off guessing purple than green, and it'll save at least six of these people because they'll all guess purple. And that's OK, and in this situation you're guaranteed to save more than half of these nine people, so you're guaranteed to save at least five of these nine people. And then probablistically maybe you can get up to seven or eight. Then there's the other method. Well, there's a ton of them. I don't go into them because I realize I don't have a lot of time. So here is the real deal solution. So really pause it and wait and watch it tomorrow, unless you don't want the solution. The guy in the back, what he does. So there are a bunch of people. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten people. And they're all wearing hats. And remember, we have 24 hours to come up with a system. So everyone has the system. And we don't know who's going to be in what order also. That's the other thing. But that actually doesn't help or hurt you much anyway. So the guy in the back, what he does is he counts the number of green or purple hats. Right? This is the system we've come up with. 1And so this is true of whoever's in the back. 1Whoever's in the back has to do this, right? 1So if he counts that the number of green-- let's say 1this is our system. 1He counts the green actually only. 1So count the green. 1And he determines that the number of 1green is an odd number. 1If he determines that the number of green that he sees 1in front of him is an odd number, then he is 1going to say green. 1For the guess on the top of his head. 1If the number of green is an even number, he's 1going to say purple. 1And of course, he doesn't know what his hat color is, but at 1least, well, one, he has a 50-50 1chance of saving himself. 1But now, what happens? 1Now, by giving this information to the rest of the 1group, by screaming green or purple. 1If this guy screams, my hat is green! 1Then this guy, who's the next guy in line, the next guy to 1be quizzed, knows that the person behind him saw an odd 1number of green hats. 1Now this is interesting. 1If he counts the number of green in front of him, and he 1also sees an odd number of green hats, then that means 1that he was not one of the green hats that this guy saw. 1So he must be a purple hat. 1So he'll just say, I have a purple hat. 1And he will live. 1Right? 1And then you'll go to this guy. 1And let's go the other situation. 1Let's say that this guy, he screamed green. 1Which means that he saw an odd number of green 1hats in front of him. 1If this guy counts the green hats of the eight people in 1front of him, and he says wow, there's only an even number of 1green hats, he could say, wow I must have a green hat. 1And so then he'll say green. 1And then he'll be right. 1Likewise, this guy-- let's say it's the first situation that 1I said, this guy has a purple hat on. 1So this guy saw an odd number of green hats. 1He screamed green. 1And so this guy, he also sees an odd number of green hats, 1because he's not one of the green hats. 1So he says purple, he lives. 1This guy all of a sudden, because this guy said purple. 1And he lived. 1I mean, you didn't hear any buzzer. 1Actually you know he's going to live, because 1the system will work. 1He knows that there must be an odd number of green hats from 1him down forward, right? 1Because this guy didn't say green. 1So if he knows that there's an odd number of green hats from 1him down forward, and if he sees an even number of green 1hats, he knows that he must be one of the green hats, so 1he'll say green. 1And in that situation, if this guy screamed green then that 1means that if this guy saw an odd number of green hats from 1here on down, and one of these guys behind him, or every time 1someone behind you says green after that, then the number of 1green hats that are odd or even in front of that person 1will change. 1And so they have to keep track of that in their minds to 1figure out if the hats in front of them are going to be 1green or purple. 1Actually let me give an example because that's 1probably the easiest way. 1So there's one, two-- Actually let me just do it in a neutral 1color so I don't waste time. 1So let's say the hats are green, purple, purple, green, 1green, purple, green, green. 1How many is that? 1One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. 1So you go to the first guy right here. 1And so he counts. 1He says, OK, how many greens are there? 1There's one, two, three, four, five. 1There are five greens. 1So the greens are odd. 1Which says that he is going to say green. 1That's the system we've come up with. 1So when they go up to this guy, he says green. 1And he's wrong. 1So he actually gets eliminated. 1And maybe the aliens were willing to give us a pass on 1the first guy, but let's say he gets eliminated. 1But he said green, so then this guy on down knows that in 1front of that guy there was an odd number of green hats. 1Now, this guy, he looks forward and he counts one, 1two, three, four, five green hats. 1So he also sees an odd number of green hats, so he knows 1that he must not have a green hat, because if he had a green 1hat, then it would turn the number of green hats that he 1saw into even. 1So he doesn't have a green hat. 1He says, I have a purple hat. 1And he lives. 1Now this guy, he counts the number of green 1hats in front of him. 1One, two, three, four green hats. 1He says, well gee, I only see an even number of green hats. 1Up until this guy, he saw an odd number of green hats. 1I must be a green hat. 1So he says green. 1Check. 1Now this guy's turn. 1So first of all, he knows how many green hats this guy saw. 1He knows that this guy saw exactly four green hats. 1Because if this guy had seen five green hats, he would have 1said purple. 1So this guy knows that this guy saw four green hats. 1But he sees only one, two, three green hats. 1Right? 1So he knows that he must be one of the green hats. 1So he screams green. 1So check. 1So then this guy knows, wow there must be only three green 1hats from him on down. 1Because this guy must have seen three green hats. 1If he saw four, he would have said purple. 1So that guy uses that same logic to say OK, there must be 1three green hats from me on down. 1I see three green hats, so I must not have one of them. 1I must be purple. 1And you just keep on going down all the way until 1everyone answers correctly. 1And you save at least nine people. 1And the bulk of humanity. 1And if you gave a pass on the first guy, 1you save all of humanity. 1Anyway, I hope you found that one enjoyable. 1This is one of my favorite brain teasers. 1And I apologize because I realize when I was trying to 1explain it without the example, it might have gotten 1a little confusing. 1But hopefully this example explains things 1a little bit better. 1Although it might be confusing to see green and purple 1written in blue. 1See you in the next video.",math_math-for-fun-and-glory_puzzles
" -  Let's see if we can figure out what 2 1/4 times three is. Pause this video and see if you can work that out. All right, now there's different ways that we could approach this. One way to approach this is to recognize that if I multiply anything times three, that means that I'm taking three of these things and adding them together. So, this is going to be the same thing as 2 1/4 plus 2 1/4 plus 2 1/4. Now, I could also view this as each of these 2 1/4 is two plus 1/4 plus two plus 1/4 plus two plus 1/4. All I did is I broke up each of the 2 1/4 into a two plus 1/4. And then what I could do is I could add the whole number parts, two plus two plus two is going to be equal to six. And then, if I were to take 1/4 plus 1/4 plus 1/4, how many fourths do I now have? I have 3/4, so it's gonna be six plus 3/4, or I could write this as 6 3/4. Now, another way that we could have approached this is we could've rewritten 2 1/4. I could have rewritten that as the same thing as two is 8/4, 8/4 is the same thing as two, plus 1/4 and then I'm multiplying that whole thing times three. And so, this is going to be the same thing as 9/4, 8/4 plus 1/4 is 9/4, times three. And so, we could say, ""Hey, that's just going to be equal ""to 9/4 plus 9/4 plus 9/4, which would be equal to what?"" Well, I have, this is going to be nine plus nine plus nine fourths, which is going to be equal to 27/4. Now, you might be saying, ""Hey, these look like they are different"", but you could check this. Six is equal to how many fourths? So, six is equal to 24/4, 24/4 plus 3/4, which is exactly equal to 27/4. And we are done.",math_cc-fourth-grade-math_4th-multiply-fractions
" All of the phase changes we've been doing so far have been under constant pressure conditions, and, in particular, with the problems that I've been doing with water phase changes in the last couple of videos, it was at atmospheric pressure, at least at sea level atmospheric pressure, or at 1 atmosphere. So it was done-- well, I'll explain this diagram in a second. But we all know that in the universe, pressure isn't always constant and it definitely isn't always constant at 1 atmosphere. 1 atmosphere was defined as the pressure at sea level on Earth. Obviously, pressure will vary wildly if you go to smaller planets or larger planets, or have thicker atmospheres, or if we're just doing different types of applications dealing with gases and liquids and solids. So what I've drawn here is a phase diagram. Let me write that down. And there are many forms of phase diagrams. This is the most common form that you might see in your chemistry class or on some standardized test, but what it captures is the different states of matter and when they transition according to temperature and pressure. This is the phase diagram for water. So just to understand what's going on here, is that on this axis, I have pressure. On the x-axis, I have temperature, and at any given point, this diagram will tell you whether you're dealing with a solid, so solid will be here, a liquid will be here, or a gas. For example, if I told you that I was at 0 degrees, let's say 0 degrees is right there, if I'm at 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphere, where am I? So 0 degrees, 1 atmosphere, I'm right at that point right there. So I'm at a boundary point between solids and liquids at 1 atmosphere of pressure, right? This is when we're at 1 atmosphere of pressure. So this coincides with our traditional notion of when ice freezes or when it melts at 0 degrees. If we made the pressure higher, what happens? Well, then ice starts melting at a lower temperature, right? So this is pressure going up, so pressure going up, let's say-- I don't know what this is. This is maybe 10 atmospheres, ten times Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level, then all of a sudden, the temperature at which solid turns into liquid-- this transition is solid to liquid --the temperature at which that happens will go down. Likewise, if we lower the pressure, if we go to Denver and it's a mile high, pressure is lower because we have less of the atmosphere above us, then all of a sudden, the freezing point increases, so the freezing point will be something above 1 degree. This isn't drawn completely to scale, but the idea is your ice would actually freeze a little bit faster and would freeze at a higher temperature in Denver than it would at the bottom of the Dead Sea or in Death Valley at some below sea level point on the planet. Now, this transition is the transition between anything and gas. And we're very familiar, this is 1 atmosphere. And remember, this is water we're dealing with. This is the diagram for water, so at 1 atmosphere, this is kind of the stuff that we're used to seeing. Let me draw a line here. So at 1 atmosphere, 0 degrees is where solid, or ice, turns into liquid water. And then we go up here, so we keep going at a higher, higher, higher temperature, and then here, this would be, since we're at 1 atmosphere, this is 100 degrees Celsius right there. And that's the point at 1 atmosphere of pressure where liquid turns into gas, or water vaporizes, or the liquid boils. All of those are acceptable ways to think about that. But what happens when we go to low pressure? Once again, let's take our little trip to Denver. So that's Denver right there. It's not that drastic. I'm just doing that for education purposes. Or even better, let's say Mount Everest. Mount Everest, very low pressure there. Then our freezing point, we already said that goes up when you lower the pressure, and your boiling point goes down, so it's much easier to boil something on the top of Mount Everest than it is to boil it at the bottom or at the lowest point in Death Valley or the Dead Sea. The intuition behind that is if I have a liquid, a bunch of molecules in liquid form, and they're touching each other, but they have enough kinetic energy to move past each other, so they're flowing past each other, they're kind of rubbing up against each other, one of the reasons why they don't just evaporate, why this guy doesn't just jump up there, is that there's air above him. There's air pressure. And air pressure, we've learned about this when we did PV nRT. That's a bunch of gas molecules, and the pressure they're creating is essentially caused by their temperature and their kinetic energy. And they sit there, and they bounce, and they essentially keep these heavier molecules from going up. They keep them from essentially separating from each other and turning into a gas. So the more pressure you have, the harder it is for these guys to escape. On the other hand, if we're in a vacuum, if we're doing this on the surface of the moon and there's none of these guys there, then just a little slight bump. Even though this guy's still a little bit attracted to over here, they're still attracted to each other. But just a little bit of bump, since there's no pressure up here on the surface of the moon, might allow this guy to escape and go straight to a gas. So when you lower the pressure, it's just that much easier to go from liquid to gas or even from solid to gas. And you might say, Sal, that's a bizarre concept, solid to gas. It turns out, if you get to low enough pressures here, I mean, let's say this is-- Actually, there's probably not stuff here. This is probably close to a vacuum right here. You could go from ice-- So if you took ice and you were on the moon and you were at the right temperature-- this is maybe some negative degrees Celsius temperature; I don't know what the exact temperature is --your ice on the moon would go directly from ice to a gas. Because there's this huge vacuum here, so these molecules would say, hey, there's all this space to fill and if they just get bumped a little bit, they're just going to escape and turn into a gas. You might say, oh, Sal, that's a strange phenomenon. It only exists on the moon. And to rebut that comment, I've drawn the phase diagram for carbon dioxide. It's all around you. You're exhaling it as we speak. Your plants in the room are hopefully inhaling it, but carbon dioxide at 1 atmosphere has a very different behavior than water. This is carbon dioxide at 1 atmosphere. Just so you know, this scale is definitely not drawn to scale. The difference between 1 atmosphere and 5 atmospheres is not the same as between 5 atmospheres and 73. Likewise, this is not drawn to scale here. This is a much larger distance than this. If I had to really draw it to scale, I'd have to stretch this chart out or do a logarithmic chart or something. But anyway, I was talking about carbon dioxide. So this is carbon dioxide solid, and this is gas, and this is liquid carbon dioxide. So at 1 atmosphere, let's say you live at sea level, like you're in New Orleans, I guess that's a little bit below sea level-- that's where I grew up --if you were able to get your fridge down to minus 80 degrees Celsius, the carbon dioxide would actually freeze. And you're actually not too unfamiliar with that, or at least you haven't been if you've gone to some-- I don't know if they still use it for smoke machines or for visual effects on stage, but this is dry ice. It's frozen carbon dioxide. If you're at sea level atmospheric pressure, as soon as you get above this minus 78 and 1/2 degrees Celsius, it sublimates to gas. So that process, where you go straight from a solid to a gas, is sublimation. And that's why dry ice, when you see it, you don't see liquid dry ice or you don't see it at standard pressures. I've never seen liquid carbon dioxide. In fact, to get liquid carbon dioxide, you have to get above 5 atmospheres so you have to get above five times the sea level pressure on Earth, and you're really not going to see that in natural conditions on Earth. You might see that on Jupiter or Saturn where you have tremendous pressures because of the gravity and all of the atmosphere above you. Liquid carbon dioxide, you might see-- I don't know if Jupiter actually has carbon, but you'll probably see it on other huge massive planets that are gas giants. But on Earth, this process is just called sublimation. It's just a neat word. Or it's sublimating. It's going straight from solid to gas and it's something you've seen with dry ice. Now, there's a couple other interesting points here and you're probably already noticing them. This right here is called the triple point, because right here at this-- Well, in the case of carbon dioxide, at 5 atmospheres and minus 56 degrees Celsius, the carbon dioxide is in a state of equilibrium between the ice, the liquid and the gas. It's a little bit of all of the three. And if you just nudge it in one direction or another by nudging the pressure or the temperature, it'll go in that direction. Similarly, water's triple point is right here. It's at a much lower pressure than we're used to dealing with. This is 0.611 kilopascals, or just 611 pascals, which is 15/1000 of an atmosphere. 1So if you go down to 5/1000 of an atmosphere and you go a 1little bit above 0 degrees Celsius, you're at the triple 1point of water. 1where water can take on any of these states if you just nudge 1it in one direction or another. 1Now, the other interesting point on these 1charts is up here. 1This is the critical point. 1Sounds very important. 1Critical point. 1And that's the point at which if you increase the 1temperature beyond that or the pressure beyond that, you're 1dealing with a supercritical fluid. 1It sounds very exciting. 1So above here, you have a supercritical fluid. 1So very high temperature, very high pressure. 1It's so high temperature that it wants to be a gas, but 1you're putting so much pressure on it that it wants 1to be a fluid, so it's a little bit of both. 1And actually, in the case of water, supercritical water is 1actually used as a solvent. 1Because you can imagine, it's kind of like liquid water in 1that things can dissolve in it, but it's so high 1temperature and it can diffuse into solids that it's really 1good at just getting whatever you want out of whatever 1you're trying to clean or somehow get into or get salt 1put into the water. 1So this is supercritical fluid and it's a fun 1thing to think about. 1But anyway, I just wanted to expose you to these phase 1diagrams. Everything I've done so far was at a constant 1pressure and I changed the temperature, but you can also 1read them the other way. 1If I'm at 100 degrees, and I go from-- Well, let's say I'm 1at 110 degrees, where at sea level is comfortably in the 1gaseous phase for-- So this is 110 degrees for water. 1It's water vapor. 1But if I were to increase the pressure and I keep increasing 1the pressure and maybe I dig a hole or something or I go into 1the ocean, then it's going to condense into water or it's 1going to condense into a liquid. 1If I did that experiment here, when I increase the pressure, 1I'm going to reverse sublimate. 1And I think I wrote down a word for what that is. 1Let me see if I wrote it down someplace. 1Oh, no, I didn't. 1I didn't write it down. 1But essentially it's something like condense, but the word is 1escaping me at the second. 1It's something on the word of 1condensing or falling together. 1Anyway, I forget the word, but it'll go straight from a gas 1to a solid. 1So these are pretty neat diagrams. They actually tell a 1lot about different substances and then tell you what happens 1when the pressure or the temperature changes.",science_chemistry_states-of-matter-and-intermolecular-forces
" -  Blue food coloring can be oxidized by household bleach, which contains hypochlorite ion, or OCI-, to form colorless products, as represented by the equation above. So we have this equation where we have blue food coloring, which has this chemical formula, and it's reacting with bleach, or hypochlorite, and it's making colorless products. So we're getting this color change from blue to colorless. A student used a spectrophotometer set at a wavelength of 625 ometers to study the absorbance of the food coloring over time during the bleaching process. In the study, bleach is present in large excess, and I will underline that 'cause that's important. It's present in large excess so that the concentration of hypochlorite is essentially constant throughout the reaction. The student used data from the study to generate the graphs below. So we'd like to answer, in part a, based on the graphs above, what is the order of the reaction with respect to the blue food coloring? So we have a lot of information here. We have these three graphs. If we write absorbance as A, we're looking at the concentration of A over time. We're looking at the ln of A over time, the natural log, and we are also, lastly, looking at one over the concentration A over time. So, we would like to know, what is the order of the reaction with respect to our blue? My first instinct when I see this problem, is actually to be a little bit panicky because, hey we have a lot of information here, so how do we deal with it? We also have a little bit more information for this problem. We also have the equation sheet. So this is the part of the equation sheet that's relevant for this problem. So it's all of the equations that have to do with kinetics, which is looking at reaction rates, so that is what we're looking at here. So we have three possible things that might be helpful for this problem. Maybe not, right? So we have this first equation which gives us the first order integrated rate law. We have the second equation, which gives us the second order integrated rate law, and we have this third equation which is actually an equation for the half-life. So it's saying half-life is .693 divided by k, and that is the half-life for a first order reaction. And the important thing to remember here, which will come up again in a second, is that this is a constant, because k is a constant, so our half-life is also a constant for a first order reaction. So that's the information we have. Let's look back at our graphs. We're gonna start by looking at just the first graph. It turns out we can get a lot of information just by looking at the concentration of A over time. So if we look at this first graph, and we look at the concentration of our blue stuff going down over time, we can see immediately that this is not linear. So the fact that it's not linear immediately tells us it's not zero order. If it was zero order, we would expect to see a straight line, which I will draw in pink, with a dotted line because that's not actually what we're seeing. So it's not zero order. We can also get some more information by looking at this one graph. We know it's not zero order. Can we tell from this first graph if it's first order? And the answer is, we actually can. If you remember from looking at the equations sheet, we said that first order reactions, so for first order reactions, we know, and I'd say this is maybe one of the most important things about first order reactions, is that half-life is constant. So that means that the time it takes for the concentration to go down to half of what it was, is the same no matter what your initial concentration is, no matter what point in your reaction you're at. So that's something we can actually investigate just by looking at this first graph. We can see how much time it takes to get to half the concentration, and see if that's something that changes over time. So for example, if we start with .8 right here, half of .8 is .4, so we can see how much time it takes to get from .8 to .4, which is right here, and if we go down we can see it takes 20 seconds to have the concentration starting at .8 absorbance units. We can look at the half-life now to go from .4 to .2. So if we go from .4 to .2, and I will change colors to make this look more obvious. We'll do this in orange. So going from .4 to .2 takes another 20 seconds. And so we can do this again and again. We could go from .2 to .1. We'll just see the continuation of a pattern here, which is that, we can see that it always takes 20 seconds to halve the concentration. And so the fact that half-life is constant based on Graph I, immediately tells us that our reaction is first order because our half-life is constant. We don't even have to look at any of the other graphs. There is another way you could do this problem. You might remember, based on the equations that we have, or based on just equations you know off the top of your head. So one reason we know, and one reason we could say this is first order, is because t 1/2 is constant. The other reason why we know this is first order is, when a reaction is first order in your reactant, you know that graphing ln of your reaction versus time, gives you a straight line, and we can see from Graph II that this is the case. So we have these two pieces of evidence, from Graph I and Graph II, that tell us that this particular reaction is actually first order with respect to the blue food coloring.",science_ap-chemistry_studying-for-ap-chemistry-exam-class
" -  In this video, we're going to discuss income inequality, which is something that is often debated, thinking about comparing countries, thinking about whether it's an issue or not and how to address it. And to appreciate what income inequality is, let's imagine two different countries. Let's imagine first, country A, and there's two people in country A. So, you have person one here, who makes $1000 a year, that's their income, and then there's person two in country A that makes $99,000 a year. So, what is going to be the average income in country A, if these are the only two people? Or you could think of it as the per capita national income. Well the average income here, average income, to figure that out, you would just have to average the 1000 and the 99,000. So you have a total income of one plus 99, 100,000 divided by two folks, well you're gonna have an average income of $50,000 per year. Now, let me construct another country that has the same average income, but the distribution is very different. So in country B, let's say the first citizen of country B, they make $50,000 a year, and let's say there's a second person in country B, and they also make $50,000 per year, per year. Well, what's the average income now? Well, this is even easier to compute, 50 plus 50 divided by two, your average income is $50,000 per year. So, what you see here is two countries that if you just looked at the average income, they seem similarly wealthy, but that doesn't give you, they seem to have similar average incomes. So you would say, oh maybe they're similarly prosperous. But when you go a step deeper, you see that they are very different. Country A is a lot more unequal than country B, when it comes to income. So, question is, is above and beyond looking at things like average income or average GDP or per capita GDP, how do you measure inequality? And this is something that this Italian statistician, Corrado Gini, tried to address, and he comes up with something called a Gini coefficient to measure income inequality for a nation. And the way he approached it is actually pretty intuitive. What he did is he sets up two axes. So, this axis right over here is going to be the cumulative percentage of the population. So, you start at 0% and then you get all the way to 100% of the population. So this is the cumulative percent of the population in a country, and then on this axis, on this axis, you have the cumulative percentage of the income in a country. So, this would be zero down here and then this would be 100 up there. And so, this is cumulative percent of income in a country, and then he said, well what would a perfectly equal society look like? Well in a perfectly equal society, as you add a percentage on your cumulative percentage of population, you should add that exact same percentage to your cumulative percentage of income. So as you go up, you really should just have a slope of one going up like this. So, one way to think about it is, when you're at 0% of the population, you should have 0% of the income. If you have a total of 10% of the population, they should have 10% of the national income. If you were to go to 50% of the population, which looks like it's around there, if it was perfectly distributed, the income, well then that should be 50% of the national income. But no nation is actually there, and so then we have to then compare that to the reality. So, let's say you look at a country, and what you do is, when you're looking at the cumulative percentage of the population, you start at the left with the lowest income, and as you add percentages of the population, you get to higher and higher income folks. So, let's say we're looking at a country that for the poorest folks, as you add percentages to the cumulative population, you're not adding the same percent to the cumulative income. And so, you might have a curve that looks like this, and then as you add percentages in the wealthier population, for every 1% you add, you're adding more than 1% of national income. And so, this curve right over here, which you could view as describing the reality for a certain nation, this is known as a Lorenz curve, Lorenz curve, and what Gini said is, well the difference between the Lorenz curve and this line right over here, that that would be a measure of income inequality. And so, he would look at this area right over here, and say, what percentage is this area between this line and the Lorenz curve, what percentage is this of this total area under the line? And this percentage is called the Gini coefficient, and it's typically quoted as being a value from zero to one, or sometimes you might see the scale as being from zero to 100. So, what would a Gini coefficient of zero represent? Well, if you have a Gini coefficient of zero, that means that this area right over here between the Lorenz curve and this line is zero. So that means that we are dealing with a perfectly equal income distribution. So at the zero end, this is perfect equality, perfect income equality, and then what does one or 100 mean? That means that the area between the line and the Lorenz curve is 100% of the area under this line. So that would look like something like this, a country whose Lorenz curve looks like something like this, where all of these people, I keep adding more and more and more population, but I'm not adding more and more income, and then all of a sudden, you get to the very last person, and then that person has all of the income. So, that person has all of the income. Well in that case, the Gini coefficient would be the percentage of this area, which would be 100%, which we could view as a one or 100. And so, an interesting thing to do is, is look at Gini coefficients for various countries and compare them. And that's exactly what we have here on this map, and you can see that the countries that are shaded red, these are countries that have high Gini coefficients. So, this is where you have more income inequality, and the ones that are shaded green are the ones where you have relatively low Gini indices or Gini coefficients, and so that would be indicative of reasonably low income inequality. Now, it's important to point out, you might think that red is always bad and green is always good, but this just tells you inequality, it does not tell you on average how prosperous folks are, what average income is in that country, and so, this is an indication that in places like Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, you definitely have very high inequality, and places like Canada and Europe, you seem to have very low inequality, but it doesn't tell you that people for sure are better off in Canada than say the United States. For example, you could have a higher average income in the United States than you have in Canada, and one can have a very spirited debate, which one you would rather be. Would you rather be in a country that has higher inequality and higher average income or one that has lower income and lower inequality?",economics-finance-domain_ap-microeconomics_ap-consumer-producer-surplus
" -  A farmer used fence posts to build a fence for Hazel Horse and Pauly Pony. The farmer used 26 fence posts to build Hazel Horse's fence and 19 fence posts to build Pauly Pony's fence. How many fence posts did the farmer use in all? If you like, I encourage you to pause the video and try to figure it out. I'm assuming you have tried it, so let's think it through together. Whenever you think about a word problem like this, what are they asking? What's the story in our head? A farmer is building fence posts for two different horses, Hazel Horse and Pauly Pony. There's even a picture of Hazel Horse here and Pauly Pony. They look very similar. The farmer used 26 fence posts to build Hazel Horse's fence, so that's these 26 fence posts right over here. These are the 26 fence posts for Hazel Horse's fence. I haven't counted it, but I'll just take their word for it that there are 26 here, and then 19 fence posts to build Pauly Pony's fence. These are 19 fence posts right over here. How many fence posts did the farmer use in all? In all, so what do they want us to do? Do they want us to add or subtract these numbers? Well, they're looking at ""in all."" How many total fence posts did the farmer use? Well, the total is how many used in Hazel's fence and Pauly's fence, so we should add these two numbers. We're going to add 26 plus the 19, or let me see. The 26 is in that brownish color, 26. That's the 26 fence posts to build Hazel Horse's fence, and we're going to add that to 19. We're going to add that to 19, so 26 for Hazel Horse and then 19 for Pauly Pony. We want to add them because we're saying how many fence posts were used in all, or in Hazel's and Pauly's fences. Let's add these two together. First, let's go to the ones place. Six ones plus nine ones is 15 ones, but we only can write one digit here, so 15 ones is the same thing as five ones and one 10, right? 15 is just one 10 and five ones, so we've essentially regrouped those 10 ones as one 10 right over here, or as some people say, you carry the one, but that's all it's saying. We're saying six plus nine is 15. 15 is five ones and one 10. We wrote that one 10 in the tens place, and then one 10 plus two 10s plus one 10. Well, the one plus two plus one is four, so it's going to be four 10s, so 45. How many fence posts used in all? 45. Now, some of you all that might have somehow tried to maybe subtract the 19 from 26, that would have been what you would have done if they said, ""How many more fence posts did the farmer use ""for Hazel's fence than for Pauly's?"" Then, you would subtract 19 from 26 to find the difference, but they didn't ask us how many more fence posts were used for Hazel than for Pauly, or how many fewer fence posts were used for Pauly than Hazel. They didn't ask us that. They said, ""How many fence posts did the farmer use in all,"" and that's why we added.",math_cc-2nd-grade-math_cc-2nd-add-subtract-100
" -  So we have some data here that we can plot on a scatter plot that looks something like that. And so, the next question given that we've been talking a lot about lines of regression or regression lines is can we fit a regression line to this? Well, if we try to, we might get something that looks like this, or maybe something that looks like this, I'm just eyeballing it, obviously you can input it into a computer to try to develop a linear regression model to try to minimize the sum of the square distances from the points to the line. But you can see it's pretty difficult. And some of you might be saying, well, this looks more like some type of an exponential. So maybe we could fit an exponential to it. So it could look something like that. And you wouldn't be wrong. But there is a way that we can apply our tools of linear regression to this dataset. And the way we can is instead of plotting x versus y, we can think about x versus the logarithm of y. So this is the exact same data set. You see the x values are the same. But for the y values, I just took the log base 10 of all of these. So 10 to the what power is equal to 2,307.23. 10 to the 3.36 power is equal to 2,307.23. And I did that for all of these data points, I did it on a spreadsheet. And if you were to plot all of these, something neat happens. All of a sudden, when we're plotting x versus the log of y, or the log of y versus x, all of a sudden, it looks linear. Now, be clear. The true relationship between x and y is not linear. It looks like some type of an exponential relationship, but the value of transforming the data, and there's different ways you can do it. In this case, the value taking the log of y, and thinking about that way, is now we can use our tools of linear regression because this data set, you could actually fit a linear regression line to this quite well. You can imagine a line that looks something like this, it would fit the data quite well. And the reason why you might wanna do this versus trying to fit an exponential is because we've already developed so many tools around linear regression and hypothesis testing around the slope and confidence intervals and so, this might be the direction you wanna go at. And what's neat is once you fit a linear regression, it's not difficult to mathematically unwind from your linear model back to an exponential one. So the big takeaway here is that the tools of linear regression can be useful even when the underlying relationship between x and y are non-linear and the way that we do that is by transforming the data. Here, we took a logarithm of the y's and that helped us see a more linear relationship of log y versus x.",math_statistics-probability_advanced-regression-inference-transforming
" -  We've used the definite integral to find areas. What I want to do now is to see if we can use the definitive role to find an arc length. What do I mean by that? Well, if I start at this point on the graph of a function, and if I were to go at this point right over here, not a straight line, we know already how to find the distance in the straight line but instead we want to find the distance along the curve. If we lay a string along the curve, what would be the distance right over here? That's what I'm talking about by arc length. What we could think about it is okay, that's going to be from x equals a to x equals b along this curve. So how can we do it? Well, the one thing that integration, integral calculus is teaching us is that when we see something that's changing like this, what we could do is we can break it up into infinitely small parts. Infinitely small parts that we can approximately with things like lines and rectangles, and then we could take the infinite sum of those infinitely small parts. So let me break up my arc length. Let me break it up into infinitely small sections of arc length. Let me call each of those infinitely small sections of my arc length a, I guess I could say a length to differential, an arc length to differential, I call it ds. I'll draw it a much bigger that when I at least I conceptualize what a differential is, just so that we could see it. What do I mean by breaking it up into these ds's? Well, if that's the ds, and then let me do the others in other colors, that's another infinitely small change in my arc length. Another infinitely small change in my arc length. If I summed all of these ds's together, I'm going to get the arc length. The arc length, if I take is going to be the integral of all of these ds's sum together over this integral so we can denote it like this. But this doesn't help me right now. This is in terms of this arc length that's differential. We do know how to do things in terms of dx's and dy's. Let's see if we can re-express this in terms of dx's and dy's. If we go on a really, really small scale, once again, we can approximate. This is going to be a line. We just the way that we approximated area with rectangles at first. But if we have an infinite number of infinite small rectangles, we're actually approximating a non-rectangular region. The area on a non-rectangular region. Similarly, we're approximating with lines with the infinitely small and there's infinite number of them, you are actually finding the length of the curve. Well, just focusing on this is a line for now. This distance right over here, I'm just going to try express in terms of dx's and dy's. So this distance right over here, that's dx. You can do this as infinitely small change in x, and this distance right over here, this is a dy. Once again, I'm being loosey-goosey with differentials. Really giving you conceptual understanding, not a reader's proof, but it'll give you a sense of where the formula for arc length is actually coming from. Based on this, you can see the ds could be expressed based on the Pythagorean Theorem as equal to dx squared plus dy squared, or you could rewrite this as square root of dx squared plus dy squared. So we could rewrite this. We could say this is the same thing as the integral of, instead of writing ds, I'm going to write it as the square root of dx squared plus dy squared. Once again, this is straight out of the Pythagorean Theorem. Now this is starting to get interesting. I've written in terms of dx's and dy's but they're getting squared. They're under radical sign. What can I do to simplify this? Or at least write it in a way that I know how to integrate. Well, I could factor out a dx squared, so let me just rewrite it. This is going to be the same thing as the integral of the square root. I'm going to factor out the dx squared, dx squared times one plus dy over dx squared. Notice this, and this is exact same quantity. If I distribute this dx squared, I'm going to get this right up here. Now I can take the dx squared out of the radical. So this is going to be the integral of, let me write that in the white color, the integral of one plus dy, dx squared. This is interesting because we know what dy, dx is. This is the derivative of our function, dy, dx squared. If you take the dx squared out of the radical, the square root of dx squared is just going to be dx. This is just going to be dx. This is just going to be dx. Now this is really interesting because we know how to find this between two bounds. We can now take the definitive role from a to b. This is now we are integrating a bunch of dx's or we're integrating with respect to x. We could say, ""Okay, x equals a to x equals b."" Let's take the sum of the product of this expression and dx, and this is essential. This is the formula for arc length. The formula for arc length. This looks complicated. In the next video, we'll see there's actually fairly straight forward to apply although sometimes in math gets airy. If you wanted to write this in slightly different notation, you could write this as equal to the integral from a to b, x equals a to x equals b of the square root of one plus. Instead of dy, dx, I could write it as f prime of x squared, dx. So if you know the function, if you know what f of x is, take the derivative of it with respect to x squared added to one, take the square root, and then multiply, and then take the definite integral of that with respect to x from a to b. We'll do that in the next video.",math_old-integral-calculus_area-and-arc-length-ic
